His early work prefigured minimal art and conceptual art and he played a prominent role in the development of geometrical abstract art and post-conceptual art.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nMorellet began to make still-life paintings at the age of 14 as he studied Russian literature in Paris. After completing his studies, he returned to Cholet in 1948, where he continued to paint, now in the spirit of the COBRA movement. After this short period of figurative/representational work, Morellet turned to abstraction in 1950 after encountering the Concrete art of Max Bill. Morellet then adopted a pictorial language of simple geometric forms: lines, squares and triangles assembled into two-dimensional compositions.  \\nIn 1960, he was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d\\u2019Art Visuel (GRAV), with fellow artists Francisco Sobrino, Horatio Garcia-Rossi, Hugo DeMarco, Julio Le Parc, Jean-Pierre Yvaral (the son of Victor Vasarely), Jo\\u00ebl Stein, Vera Moln\\u00e1r and Fran\\u00e7ois Moln\\u00e1r (the last two left the group shortly after). Morellet began at this time to work with neon tube lighting.\\nFrom the 1960s on, Morellet worked in various materials (fabric, tape, neon, walls...) and in doing so investigated the use of the exhibition space in terms similar to artists of installation art and environmental art.  He gained an international reputation, especially in Germany and France, and he was commissioned to create work for public and private collections in Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S. One of his works is part of the permanent collection of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. In 2016/2017, the CILA staged a retrospective of Morellet's Light Art, the last exhibition to be curated by the artist himself, shortly before his death in May 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nMorellet's abstract ideal was, he said, tempered by the charming nihilism of Marcel Duchamp. For him, a work of art referred only to itself. \\nHis titles are generally sophisticated, show some Duchampian word play, and describe the \\\"constraints\\\" or \\\"rules\\\" that he used to create them. Like other contemporary artists who use constraints and chance (or the aleatory) in their works, such as John Cage in music and the Oulipo group in literature, Morellet used rules and constraints established in advance to guide the creation of his works while also allowing chance to play a role in some of his compositions. This dialectic between the rigid rule-based procedure and chance situates his work within the Post-conceptual art category.\\nHis rigorous use of geometry tends to create emotionally neutral work, and also placed him close to Minimal art and Conceptual art in his aims. He shared a particular affinity to the American artists Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt.\\n\\nSeries: R\\u00e9partitions al\\u00e9atoires (\\\"Chance divisions\\\") from the 1950s\\nR\\u00e9partition de 16 formes identiques - painted after his visit to the Alhambra of Granada\\nSeries: Trames from the 1950s\\nSeries: D\\u00e9sint\\u00e9grations architecturales (\\\"Architectural disintegrations\\\") from 1971\\nSeries: G\\u00e9om\\u00e9tr\\u00e9es from 1983\\nSeries: D\\u00e9figurations from 1988\\nSeries: D\\u00e9clinaisons de pi (\\\"Versions of pi\\\") from 1998\\n\\n\\tAlbum de 10 s\\u00e9rigraphies sur 10 ans (1952-1961), Fran\\u00e7ois Morellet, 1975, Mus\\u00e9e Groninger\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nApril 10, 2016, the first Fran\\u00e7ois Morellet Prize (awarded to a personality for his writings on art) was awarded to Catherine Millet by Philippe M\\u00e9aille.

He is best known for his Soundsuit series: wearable assemblage fabric sculptures that are bright, whimsical, and other-worldly, often made with found objects. He also trained as a dancer with Alvin Ailey and often incorporates dance and performance into his works. His later sculptures have focused on color theory and included mixed media and large-scale installations.  He lives in Chicago, Illinois, and directs the graduate fashion program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He continues to work on Soundsuits as well as works completed as a sculptor, dancer, and performance artist.\\nHis first career retrospective museum exhibition opened in May 2022 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and is currently on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, through April 2023. He received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Rhode Island School of Design in June 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNick Cave was raised in Fulton, Missouri, alongside seven brothers by a single mother who encouraged Cave's interest in fashion. His grandparents owned a farm in Chariton, Missouri, where Cave would sometimes help care for crops and chickens. He attributes much of his interests in found objects and assemblage to his childhood circumstances. Graduating from Hickman High School in 1977, he enrolled in the Kansas City Art Institute, where he would study fiber arts and later earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1982. In 1979, Cave met Alvin Ailey and spent that summer and several summers thereafter in New York, where he studied with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.  After graduating from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1982, he designed displays for the department store, Macy's, and worked professionally as a fashion designer while maintaining his interest in art and dance.\\nIn 1988, Cave earned his M.F.A. degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He also did some graduate coursework at the University of North Texas. After graduating from Cranbrook, he went on to teach in a fiber arts program at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989. Since then, Cave has run a clothing company in Chicago where he designs, manufactures, and markets his own line of men's & women's clothing.\\n\\n\\n== Creative thought and process ==\\nCave's low socio-economic status growing up forced him to repair hand-me-downs from older siblings. He learned to sew, which led to his first Soundsuit. Up until then, his work had nothing to do with the figure or performance art. He explained that he made a sudden shift that would redefine the work he was making.\\nInfluences of African art traditions, armor, ceremonial dress, couture fashion, and designed textiles, as well as stereotypically feminine objects, are present in his work to express a multitude of concepts. Much of his work is in the round, but occasionally he enjoys the dimension created when working with bas-relief, referring to them as paintings. His work deals with strategies to negotiate the real-life stakes of vulnerability and consequence by transforming the experience and environment. With his performance art, he aims to create situations where diverse communities come together to share the experience, making sure to distinguish his pieces as art rather than costumes. Cave describes himself not as an artist but as a messenger as his work frequently deals with spectacle and responsibility. One such work of his that follows this principle is Augment. This piece consists of five assemblages made with more than 1,000 inflatable lawn decorations that are sewn together. The sculptures were on display in the Cyclorama at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston's South End from August 8, 2019, to September 13, 2019. On September 14, the piece was taken to the streets in the form of a parade with the mission to spread joy through the South End and Upham's Corner neighborhoods in Boston. More than 75 Boston-area artists and performers and 500 members of the public participated in this parade to bridge the gap between the two neighborhoods. At its final location at 555 Columbia Avenue in Upham's corner, the piece spills out through the windows of a custom-designed building wrapped in collages made by members of the Upham's Corner community.\\nCave creates most of his pieces in a workshop with several assistants, fabricators, and suppliers, his head assistant being Jen Grygiel. Cave most often commissions fabrication from a shop in Skokie, Illinois, called \\\"Iron and Wire\\\" owned by David Greene.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Soundsuits ===\\n\\nSoundsuits are sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer's body in materials including but not limited to dyed human hair, sisal, plastic buttons, beads, wire, sequins, and feathers. Soundsuits camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender, and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment. In using everyday objects, Cave can create an atmosphere of familiarity while rearranging the objects into interpretive representations of both social and material culture. As race, identity, and gender are generally accepted to form the axis of his work, Cave's soundsuits can telegraph many concepts simultaneously. Their meaning can therefore change based on their environment, movement, fixed state, and/or the inclusion of group choreography. The finished pieces bear some resemblance to African ceremonial costumes and masks. The suits also reference carnival costumes, Dogon costumes, Rococo, and ball culture.\\nCave's first soundsuit was created in 1992, as a reaction to the beating of Rodney King. Cave collected a large number of sticks and twigs from the ground and fashioned them into a suit that, to his surprise, made sounds when worn. His suits are most often presented for public viewing as static sculptures, but they are also observed through live performance, video, and photography. Bringing his interactive creations to life, \\\"Cave regularly performs in the sculptures himself, dancing either before the public or for the camera, activating their full potential as costume, musical instrument, and living icon.\\\" He has produced more than 500 soundsuits, since the creation of his first in 1992. He is very much inspired by dance and choreography, which works well with soundsuits because they allow the expression of both arts in one piece. He talks about how he wants his work to be seen without the artist in mind. With the Soundsuits series, the viewer doesn't know the identity, gender, or race of the wearer.\\nIn 2021, Cave was commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York to create a permanent installation inspired by his soundsuits spanning the Times Square-42nd Street and 42nd Street-Bryant Park subway stations. The work, Each One, Every One, Equal All (2021), consists of a series of mosaic tile murals of imagined and real soundsuits and mobiles created by Cave, along with video installations of the soundsuits in motion. Writing about the installation in The New York Times before its completion in 2022, critic John Vincler described the figures in the work as \\\"joyous\\\" and said the piece \\\"feels like a necessary correction, right at home amid the noise and teem\\\" of the subway. \\nOne of these Soundsuits was chosen by Peter Gabriel to represent his song \\\"Live and Let Live\\\", the final single on his eighth album i/o, released in 2023.\\n\\n\\n=== HEARD\\u2022NY \\u2013 Soundsuit performance ===\\nIn 2013, Cave worked with the dancers of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company, in which he was formerly a dancer, and created HEARD\\u2022NY. This performance took place in one of the city's most bustling thoroughfares, Grand Central Terminal's Vanderbilt Hall. HEARD\\u2022NY was not a purely visual spectacle, but a layered commentary on ceremony (particularly, costumed West African ritual), identity, and the place of dreams in civic life. \\nA herd of 30 colorful life-size horses broke into choreographed movement\\u2014or \\u201ccrossings\\u201d\\u2014 twice a day for just a week and was accompanied by live music. Each suit, made of brightly-colored synthetic raffia, was operated by two dancers from the Alvin Ailey Dance Company. The project was presented by Creative Time and MTA Arts for Transit as part of a series of events celebrating the centennial of Grand Central. Cave's soundsuits were created to be seen in motion. \\nChoreographed performances such as these show the audience what the soundsuits look and sound like in their true form. Soundsuit sculpture is part of Colecci\\u00f3n SOLO museum and is showed as part of its permanent exhibition and was part of different temporal exhibitions, such Certeza (2023), at its museum in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n=== Mixed media ===\\nCave's works outside of his soundsuits are predominantly mixed-media sculptures and large-scale installations that use found objects and brightly colored fabrics. He creates sculptural art that discusses current racial tensions, especially gun violence and its impact on Black men. One such piece is TM 13, a sculpture that responds to the life and 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. After George Zimmerman was acquitted of Martin's murder on July 13, 2013 (hence the title \\\"TM 13\\\"), Cave created a powerful sculpture centering on a hoodie, denim pants, a Black mannequin, and sneakers. The sculpture is conspicuously covered in a net, \\\"creat[ing] a kind of Soundsuit for the ghost of Trayvon Martin. A way for a dead black teenager to make an outcry and an uproar, to protest against his undeserved demise\\\".\\nCave's mixed-media sculptures often include black doll or mannequin parts (heads, hands, etc.) placed at the center or top of a piece, creating an altar-like semblance. By focusing his pieces in this manner, viewers of his art can \\\"examine the history of trauma and racism, ... the objectification of the black male\\\". His 2014 exhibition Rescue \\\"inspects the idea of servitude and the accompanying stigma within the Black community\\\". Most of these works are not audible, like his 2016\\u20132017 exhibition Until at MASS MoCa, as Cave wants the exhibition participants \\\"to be included \\u2013 and implicated \\u2013 in the work\\\" as opposed to focusing on sound and movement. The act of viewing his works with participants seeing one another at the same time is a metaconcept Cave promotes.\\n\\n\\n== Teaching career ==\\n\\nCave has taught extensively at universities across the United States. He began working at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989 as a professor in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies and was later appointed to the Department of Fashion. As of 2018, he served as the graduate director of the fashion program and chair of the department. He has served as a visiting instructor and artist at a number of other institutions, among them Beloit College, Fabric Workshop & Museum, McColl Center for Art + Innovation, Pilchuck Glass School, University of Arizona, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nCave has participated in numerous solo exhibitions and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally. His solo shows include New Work (1997), Grand Arts, Kansas City, Missouri; Nick Cave: A Quarter Til Ten (2006-2007), Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh; Nick Cave: Meet Me at the Center of the Earth (2009-2012), originating at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco; Until (2016-2021), originating at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams; and Nick Cave: Truth Be Told (2020-2021), originating at Jack Shainman Gallery, New York. His first museum retrospective, Nick Cave: Forothermore, opened in 2022 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and later travelled to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\\nHe has also participated in a number of group exhibitions, including the 51st Venice Biennale (2005) and the NGV Triennial (2017-2018).\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nCave's work has been met with positive reception. Fellow namesake Nick Cave, an Australian rock musician of the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, has spoken positively of the former's work, stating that he has \\\"admired the work of the American artist [...] for many years\\\", and drawing attention to its merits as \\\"an attempt to transmute suffering into a kind of knowing and shielding joy\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nCave's husband is fellow designer Bob Faust.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\n\\\"Soundsuit,\\\" Baltimore Museum of Art Google Art Project\\n\\\"At Home and in the Studio with Nick Cave: Home Tour\\\".

              "  'Olivia Caramello is an Italian mathematician. She holds a national Rita Levi-Montalcini associate professorship at the University of Insubria in Como, Italy. She is known for her work in topos theory and for pioneering the technique of toposes as bridges. She authored the 2017 book Theories, Sites, Toposes: Relating and studying mathematical theories through topos-theoretic bridges.\\n\\n\\n== Education and early career ==\\nCaramello earned her bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics at the University of Turin and her Diploma in Piano at the Conservatorio di Cuneo at the age of 19.\\nIn 2009, she obtained her Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (UK), as a Prince of Wales Student of Trinity College, with a thesis entitled \"The duality between Grothendieck toposes and geometric theories\" under the supervision of Peter Johnstone. In 2016, she obtained her Habilitation at Paris Diderot University with a habilitation thesis entitled \"Grothendieck toposes as unifying bridges in Mathematics\".\\nCaramello has held a research fellowship at Jesus College, Cambridge and post-doctoral appointments at the De Giorgi Center of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, Paris Diderot University and the University of Milan (as holder of a Marie Curie Fellowship of the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica) and the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nCaramello developed the theory of \"toposes as bridges\", which consists in methods and techniques for unifying different mathematical theories and transferring information between them by using toposes. This theory is based on the duality of sites and Grothendieck toposes, and on the notion of classifying topos of a geometric first-order theory, exploiting the diversity of possible presentations of each topos by infinitely many sites or theories. Caramello\\'s theory involves several components : on the one hand, establishing equivalences between toposes presented in different ways; on the other hand, calculating or expressing topos invariants in terms of the various types of presentations considered, in order to produce correspondences between properties or elements of these various presentations.\\nThe theory of \"toposes as bridges\" can be considered a meta-mathematical theory of the relations between different theories and her program contributes to realizing the unifying potential of the notion of topos already glimpsed by Alexander Grothendieck.\\nCaramello organized international conferences in topos theory, \"Topos à l\\'IHES\" (2015). and \"Toposes in Como\" (2018) She is an editor of the journal Logica Universalis and is running a blog and forum about toposes.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and recognition ==\\nCaramello was awarded the AILA (Associazione Italiana di Logica e sue Applicazioni) Prize in 2011, a \"L\\'Oréal-Unesco Fellowship for Women in Science\" in 2014  and a \"Rita Levi Montalcini\" position of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research in 2017.\\nCaramello\\'s methodology of toposes as bridges has been qualified by André Joyal as a \"vast extension of Felix Klein\\'s Erlangen Programme\" and has been endorsed by Fields Medalists Alain Connes and Laurent Lafforgue.\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\nIn 2015 Caramello had a public controversy with a number of senior exponents of the category theory community, whom she accused of spreading negative ungrounded opinions on her work; her case is discussed in an academic paper.\\n\\n\\n== Selected publications ==\\nCaramello, Olivia (2014). \"Fraïssé\\'s construction from a topos-theoretic perspective\".

              "  'Topology optimization is a mathematical method that optimizes material layout within a given design space, for a given set of loads, boundary conditions and constraints with the goal of maximizing the performance of the system. Topology optimization is different from shape optimization and sizing optimization in the sense that the design can attain any shape within the design space, instead of dealing with predefined configurations.\\nThe conventional topology optimization formulation uses a finite element method (FEM) to evaluate the design performance. The design is optimized using either gradient-based mathematical programming techniques such as the optimality criteria algorithm and the method of moving asymptotes or non gradient-based algorithms such as genetic algorithms.\\nTopology optimization has a wide range of applications in aerospace, mechanical, bio-chemical and civil engineering. Currently, engineers mostly use topology optimization at the concept level of a design process. Due to the free forms that naturally occur, the result is often difficult to manufacture. For that reason the result emerging from topology optimization is often fine-tuned for manufacturability. Adding constraints to the formulation in order to increase the manufacturability is an active field of research. In some cases results from topology optimization can be directly manufactured using additive manufacturing; topology optimization is thus a key part of design for additive manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n== Problem statement ==\\nA topology optimization problem can be written in the general form of an optimization problem as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    minimize\\n                    ρ\\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n              \\n              \\n                F\\n                =\\n                F\\n                (\\n                \\n                  u\\n                  (\\n                  ρ\\n                  )\\n                  ,\\n                  ρ\\n                \\n                )\\n                =\\n                \\n                  ∫\\n                  \\n                    Ω\\n                  \\n                \\n                f\\n                (\\n                \\n                  u\\n                  (\\n                  ρ\\n                  )\\n                  ,\\n                  ρ\\n                \\n                )\\n                \\n                  d\\n                \\n                V\\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              \\n              \\n                \\n                  s\\n                  u\\n                  b\\n                  j\\n                  e\\n                  c\\n                  t\\n                  \\n                  t\\n                  o\\n                \\n              \\n              \\n              \\n                \\n                  G\\n                  \\n                    0\\n                  \\n                \\n                (\\n                ρ\\n                )\\n                =\\n                \\n                  ∫\\n                  \\n                    Ω\\n                  \\n                \\n                ρ\\n                \\n                  d\\n                \\n                V\\n                −\\n                \\n                  V\\n                  \\n                    0\\n                  \\n                \\n                ≤\\n                0\\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              \\n              \\n              \\n              \\n                \\n                  G\\n                  \\n                    j\\n                  \\n                \\n                (\\n                \\n                  u\\n                \\n                (\\n                ρ\\n                )\\n                ,\\n                ρ\\n                )\\n                ≤\\n                0\\n                \\n                   with \\n                \\n                j\\n                =\\n                1\\n                ,\\n                .\\n                .\\n                .\\n                ,\\n                m\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}&{\\\\underset {\\\\rho }{\\\\operatorname {minimize} }}&&F=F(\\\\mathbf {u(\\\\rho ),\\\\rho } )=\\\\int _{\\\\Omega }f(\\\\mathbf {u(\\\\rho ),\\\\rho } )\\\\mathrm {d} V\\\\\\\\&\\\\operatorname {subject\\\\;to} &&G_{0}(\\\\rho )=\\\\int _{\\\\Omega }\\\\rho \\\\mathrm {d} V-V_{0}\\\\leq 0\\\\\\\\&&&G_{j}(\\\\mathbf {u} (\\\\rho ),\\\\rho )\\\\leq 0{\\\\text{ with }}j=1,...,m\\\\end{aligned}}}\\n  \\n\\nThe problem statement includes the following:\\n\\nAn objective function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        F\\n        (\\n        \\n          u\\n          (\\n          ρ\\n          )\\n          ,\\n          ρ\\n        \\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle F(\\\\mathbf {u(\\\\rho ),\\\\rho } )}\\n  \\n.

This indicates the allowable volume within which the design can exist.

This is most commonly done using the finite element method since these equations do not have a known analytical solution.\\n\\n\\n== Implementation methodologies ==\\nThere are various implementation methodologies that have been used to solve topology optimization problems.\\n\\n\\n=== Solving with discrete/binary variables ===\\nSolving topology optimization problems in a discrete sense is done by discretizing the design domain into finite elements. The material densities inside these elements are then treated as the problem variables. In this case material density of one indicates the presence of material, while zero indicates an absence of material. Owing to the attainable topological complexity of the design being dependent on the number of elements, a large number is preferred. Large numbers of finite elements increases the attainable topological complexity, but come at a cost. Firstly, solving the FEM system becomes more expensive. Secondly, algorithms that can handle a large number (several thousands of elements is not uncommon) of discrete variables with multiple constraints are unavailable. Moreover, they are impractically sensitive to parameter variations. In literature problems with up to 30000 variables have been reported.\\n\\n\\n=== Solving the problem with continuous variables ===\\nThe earlier stated complexities with solving topology optimization problems using binary variables has caused the community to search for other options. One is the modelling of the densities with continuous variables. The material densities can now also attain values between zero and one. Gradient based algorithms that handle large amounts of continuous variables and multiple constraints are available. But the material properties have to be modelled in a continuous setting. This is done through interpolation. One of the most implemented interpolation methodologies is the  Solid Isotropic Material with Penalisation method (SIMP). This interpolation is essentially a power law \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        E\\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n        \\n          ρ\\n          \\n            p\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        −\\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle E\\\\;=\\\\;E_{0}\\\\,+\\\\,\\\\rho ^{p}(E_{1}-E_{0})}\\n  \\n. It interpolates the Young\\'s modulus of the material to the scalar selection field. The value of the penalisation parameter \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        p\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle p}\\n  \\n is generally taken between \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        [\\n        1\\n        ,\\n        \\n        3\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle [1,\\\\,3]}\\n  \\n.  This has been shown to confirm the micro-structure of the materials. In the SIMP method a lower bound on the Young\\'s modulus is added, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle E_{0}}\\n  \\n, to make sure the derivatives of the objective function are non-zero when the density becomes zero. The higher the penalisation factor, the more SIMP penalises the algorithm in the use of non-binary densities. Unfortunately, the penalisation parameter also introduces non-convexities.\\n\\n\\n=== Commercial software ===\\nThere are several commercial topology optimization software on the market. Most of them use topology optimization as a hint how the optimal design should look like, and manual geometry re-construction is required. There are a few solutions which produce optimal designs ready for Additive Manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\n\\n\\n=== Structural compliance ===\\n\\nA stiff structure is one that has the least possible displacement when given certain set of boundary conditions. A global measure of the displacements is the strain energy (also called compliance) of the structure under the prescribed boundary conditions. The lower the strain energy the higher the stiffness of the structure. So, the objective function of the problem is to minimize the strain energy.\\nOn a broad level, one can visualize that the more the material, the less the deflection as there will be more material to resist the loads. So, the optimization requires an opposing constraint, the volume constraint. This is in reality a cost factor, as we would not want to spend a lot of money on the material. To obtain the total material utilized, an integration of the selection field over the volume can be done.\\nFinally the elasticity governing differential equations are plugged in so as to get the final problem statement.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          min\\n          \\n            ρ\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          ∫\\n          \\n            Ω\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          σ\\n        \\n        :\\n        \\n          ε\\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          d\\n        \\n        Ω\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\min _{\\\\rho }\\\\;\\\\int _{\\\\Omega }{\\\\frac {1}{2}}\\\\mathbf {\\\\sigma } :\\\\mathbf {\\\\varepsilon } \\\\,\\\\mathrm {d} \\\\Omega }\\n  \\n\\nsubject to:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ρ\\n        \\n        ∈\\n        \\n        [\\n        0\\n        ,\\n        \\n        1\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\rho \\\\,\\\\in \\\\,[0,\\\\,1]}\\n  \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ∫\\n          \\n            Ω\\n          \\n        \\n        ρ\\n        \\n        \\n          d\\n        \\n        Ω\\n        \\n        ≤\\n        \\n        \\n          V\\n          \\n            ∗\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\int _{\\\\Omega }\\\\rho \\\\,\\\\mathrm {d} \\\\Omega \\\\;\\\\leq \\\\;V^{*}}\\n  \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          ∇\\n        \\n        ⋅\\n        \\n          σ\\n        \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n        \\n          F\\n        \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {\\\\nabla } \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf {\\\\sigma } \\\\,+\\\\,\\\\mathbf {F} \\\\;=\\\\;{\\\\mathbf {0} }}\\n  \\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          σ\\n        \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            C\\n          \\n        \\n        :\\n        \\n          ε\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {\\\\sigma } \\\\;=\\\\;{\\\\mathsf {C}}:\\\\mathbf {\\\\varepsilon } }\\n  \\n\\nBut, a straightforward implementation in the finite element framework of such a problem is still infeasible owing to issues such as:\\n\\nMesh dependency—Mesh Dependency means that the design obtained on one mesh is not the one that will be obtained on another mesh. The features of the design become more intricate as the mesh gets refined.\\nNumerical instabilities—The selection of region in the form of a chess board.\\nSome techniques such as filtering based on image processing are currently being used to alleviate some of these issues. Although it seemed like this was purely a heuristic approach for a long time, theoretical connections to nonlocal elasticity have been made to support the physical sense of these methods.\\n\\n\\n=== Multiphysics problems ===\\n\\n\\n==== Fluid-structure-interaction ====\\nFluid-structure-interaction is a strongly coupled phenomenon and concerns the interaction between a stationary or moving fluid and an elastic structure. Many engineering applications and natural phenomena are subject to fluid-structure-interaction and to take such effects into consideration is therefore critical in the design of many engineering applications. Topology optimisation for fluid structure interaction problems has been studied in e.g. references and. Design solutions solved for different Reynolds numbers are shown below. The design solutions depend on the fluid flow with indicate that the coupling between the fluid and the structure is resolved in the design problems.\\n\\n\\n==== Thermoelectric energy conversion ====\\n\\nThermoelectricity is a multi-physic problem which concerns the interaction and coupling between electric and thermal energy in semi conducting materials. Thermoelectric energy conversion can be described by two separately identified effects: The Seebeck effect and the Peltier effect. The Seebeck effect concerns the conversion of thermal energy into electric energy and the Peltier effect concerns the conversion of electric energy into thermal energy. By spatially distributing two thermoelectric materials in a two dimensional design space with a topology optimisation methodology, it is possible to exceed performance of the constitutive thermoelectric materials for thermoelectric coolers and thermoelectric generators.\\n\\n\\n=== 3F3D Form Follows Force 3D Printing ===\\nThe current proliferation of 3D printer technology has allowed designers and engineers to use topology optimization techniques when designing new products. Topology optimization combined with 3D printing can result in less weight, improved structural performance and shortened design-to-manufacturing cycle. As the designs, while efficient, might not be realisable with more traditional manufacturing techniques.\\n\\n\\n=== Internal contact ===\\nInternal contact can be included in topology optimization by applying the third medium contact method. The third medium contact (TMC) method is an implicit contact formulation that is continuous and differentiable. This makes TMC suitable for use with gradient-based approaches to topology optimization.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nPedersen, Claus B.

She is known for her work on mathematical neuroscience, including the applications of mathematics in both theoretical and computational neuroscience. Her recent work is funded by the BRAIN Initiative. She is an associate editor at SIAGA, a SIAM journal on applied algebra and geometry and on the editorial board at Physical Review Research.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCurto was born to Argentine parents and grew up in Iowa City. She attended Iowa City West High School. During her school years, she attended courses at University of Iowa, including advanced mathematics classes, physics, computer science, French literature, and more. In 1996, she began studying for an A.B. in Physics at Harvard University. During her time at Harvard, she was awarded prizes including the Detur Book Prize, one of Harvard's oldest awards, and the American Physical Society minority scholarship. After graduating from Harvard in 2000 and being awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Curto started a Ph.D in mathematics at Duke University. Curto's Ph.D. focused on mathematical string theory and algebraic geometry. Her thesis was titled 'Matrix Model Superpotentials and Calabi-Yau Spaces: an ADE Classification'.\\n\\n\\n== Career and research ==\\nOnce Curto gained her Ph.D., she moved to Rutgers University in New Jersey, working as a postdoctoral associate in a neuroscience lab at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience. After three years at Rutgers, she returned to working in mathematics, focusing on neuroscience from a more mathematical perspective, and moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University, then to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, followed by the Pennsylvania State University. Curto is a professor of mathematics, the co-head of their mathematical neuroscience lab, and a member of the Center for Neural Engineering.\\n\\n\\n=== Network connectivity ===\\nHer research focuses on the interplay between the connectivity and dynamics of the brain and involves studying neural recordings and analysing the patterns of the activities. This network analysis aims to understand the connections between the neurons and their patterns. Traditionally, neuroscientists rely on tools from physics. But Curto's approach uses tools from pure mathematics, particularly algebraic geometry, which is applied to the activity data of the neurons. Curto's research is significant in the field of connectomics. For instance, one study showed how neural activities can drastically change by slightly changing the structure of the networks, which has implications for the study of brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.\\nAlong with Katherine Morrison from the University of Northern Colorado, and with funding from the government's BRAIN Initiative grant and the NSF, Curto is working on Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks, CTLNs. These models enable the observations of emergent patterns, such as neuronal sequences and complex rhythms, and can also be used to predict features of the dynamics, something that has been seemingly difficult to predict.\\nAligned with her research, Curto, alongside Morrison, also created a project called Network Songs, which originally started out as a gimmick. This is a collection of songs, that show the rhythmic activity of the networks. The basis of the songs were created by assigning a note on the piano to each neuron. Curto explains that sometimes certain patterns are better distinguished by the ear, than by the eye, hence the purpose of this particular representation of the network data.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and personal life ==\\nCurto has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including becoming a Woodrow Wilson National Fellow and an Alfred Sloan Research Fellow. Additionally, in 2012, Curto was named a UNL Academic Star.

She attended the Robinson Seminary public secondary school in Exeter, New Hampshire, and then enrolled in Wellesley College in 1917 where she was a Durant scholar. She graduated as a mathematics major in 1921 and immediately began teaching math at the Massena High School in New York.\\nOn March 28, 1922, Wiggin received a letter from professor Roland George Dwight Richardson at Brown University, who said, \"at the suggestion of my good friends, Misses [Helen A.] Merrill and [Clara E.] Smith at Wellesley,\" invited her to apply for a graduate assistant position in the math department at Brown University. He noted that he usually had \"four or five students studying for master\\'s degrees each year, half of whom were women.\" Wiggin took the position and began work toward her M.A. degree in the autumn of 1922. As Richardson\\'s assistant, she also taught classes of girls who were deficient in algebra and geometry. She completed her master\\'s degree in 1924.\\nFor the next three years, Wiggin taught math at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, and in 1927, she received another note from Richardson encouraging her to continue graduate work saying, \"If you care to take some course for credit in absentia here at Brown, I think it could be arranged. I know you will want to keep on with your studies in some sort of way. Possibly you can go to Chicago some summer.\" She enrolled at the University of Chicago that same year.\\nIn 1929 Wiggin joined the faculty of Randolph-Macon Woman\\'s College (now Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia, as an associate professor. On March 31, 1931, her Randolph colleague Gillie Larew wrote to Gilbert Ames Bliss, who had been Larew\\'s own doctoral advisor at the University of Chicago, saying, \"I want to thank you again for sending us Miss Wiggin and express the hope that we may keep her for a long, long time. She is everything she should be both as teacher and as a person.\"\\nIn 1935, Wiggin returned to the University of Chicago for a year and finished her dissertation, titled A Boundary Value Problem of the Calculus of Variations, supervised by Gilbert Ames Bliss and William Thomas Reid. She was awarded her doctorate in 1936 and rejoined Randolph-Macon, where, in 1941, she was promoted to full professor. She remained there until her retirement, though she did take several leaves to teach elsewhere, including at Wellesley College, Emory University and the University of Chicago. \\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nOn June 20, 1956, at age 56, Evelyn Wiggin married Sidney Casner, a retired lawyer, in Chicago, and took the name Evelyn Wiggin Casner.

She graduated from Smith College in 1945. She performed pioneering work in the field of computing.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nEvelyn Boyd was born in Washington, D.C.; her father worked odd jobs due to the Great Depression but separated from her mother when Boyd was young. Boyd and her older sister were raised by her mother and aunt, who both worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. She was valedictorian at Dunbar High School, which at that time was a segregated but academically competitive school for black students in Washington.\\nWith financial support from her aunt and a small partial scholarship from Phi Delta Kappa, Boyd entered Smith College in the fall of 1941. She majored in mathematics and physics, but also took a keen interest in astronomy. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to Sigma Xi and graduated summa cum laude in 1945. Encouraged by a graduate scholarship from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College, she applied to graduate programs in mathematics and was accepted by both Yale University and the University of Michigan; she chose Yale because of the financial aid they offered. There she studied functional analysis under the supervision of Einar Hille, finishing her doctorate in 1949. Her dissertation was \"On Laguerre Series in the Complex Domain\".\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nFollowing graduate school, Boyd went to New York University Institute for Mathematics and performed research and teaching there. After, in 1950, she took a teaching position at Fisk University, a college for black students in Nashville, Tennessee (more prestigious postings being unavailable to black women). Two of her students there, Vivienne Malone-Mayes and Etta Zuber Falconer, went on to earn doctorates in mathematics of their own. But by 1952 she left academia and returned to Washington with a position at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories. In January 1956, she moved to IBM as a computer programmer; when IBM received a NASA contract, she moved to Vanguard Computing Center in Washington, D.C.\\nBoyd moved from Washington to New York City in 1957.

According to McNair, \"When Agnes Scott became a college in 1905-1906, [Young] continued in the college faculty; however, feeling that she should have a degree, she took the requisite courses and received her B.A. degree in 1910.\" (According to a different source, she earned her A.B. degree in 1898.)\\nFrom 1910 until her sudden passing in 1920, she served as Professor of Mathematics, Physics and Astronomy at Agnes Scott. She also taught summer school at the University of Georgia.\\nIn 1914, Young took a leave of absence to earn her master\\'s degree in education from Columbia University in New York.\\n\\nAccording to McNair, she was known as an exceptional teacher. \\n\"One account is of a senior who repeatedly failed trigonometry \\'until the day came when she had the last exam that she could have on it. And she\\'d studied so hard and was so scared that in the glare of the classroom and under the sound of the thumping of her own heart she forgot everything she knew and didn\\'t try to work some of the problems. That night she was sent for and she went to Miss Young\\'s room. \\'Now,\\' said Miss Young sweetly and firmly, \\'I know you know this, and I know you can work these problems. Sit down in that chair and work them.\\' And there in the quiet she worked them. And so — she passed.\"She was a charter member of the school\\'s alumnae association and was very active in campus life until the time of her death.\\n\\n\\n=== Sudden death ===\\nDuring a 1920 trip to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to visit relatives, Young contracted pneumonia and died at 46 years of age on September 3. She was buried in Westview Cemetery, Atlanta, Georgia.\\nAt her funeral service, Agnes Scott President Frank Henry Gaines said, \"A truer woman, a finer character, a more devoted Christian, a more useful member of the College community, it would be difficult to find.\"\\nThe 1920 class of Agnes Scott student, the last group to graduate while Young was alive, dedicated their college yearbook to her with this: \"To her whose loyal devotion has ever been an inspiration in our college life.\"\\nIn 1923, a new building on the campus of Agnes Scott was called the Anna Young Alumnae House, in memory of the professor.\\n\\n\\n== Memberships ==\\nAnna Irwin Young was a charter member of the Mathematical Association of America (in 1916).

              "  'Anneli Cahn Lax (23 February 1922, Katowice – 24 September 1999, New York City) was an American mathematician, who was known for being an editor of the Mathematics Association of America\\'s New Mathematical Library Series, and for her work in reforming mathematics education with the inclusion of language skills. Lax received a bachelor\\'s degree in 1942 from Adelphi University and her doctorate in 1956. She was a professor of mathematics at New York University\\'s Courant Institute. She was married to the mathematician Peter Lax.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\nIn 1942, she earned a bachelor\\'s degree in mathematics at Adelphi University in Long Island. In 1956, she earned a PhD from New York University with the dissertation Cauchy\\'s Problem for a Partial Differential Equation with Real Multiple Characteristics with thesis adviser Richard Courant.\\nShe became a mathematics professor at NYU and was the editor of the Mathematics Association of America\\'s New Mathematical Library Series.\\nIn 1961, the series started, with 36 published volumes by 1995. It was planned, by Professor Lax and others, to make mathematics accessible to the average reader while still being technically accurate. The first two books were, Numbers: Rational and Irrational by Ivan Niven and What Is Calculus About? by W. W. Sawyer.\\nIn 1977, she won the George Pólya Award for her article: Linear Algebra, A Potent Tool, Vol. 7 (1976), 3–15. In 1980, the mathematics department of New York University assigned Lax to design a remedial course in mathematics for freshmen. The course she devised and called \"Mathematical Thinking\" presented mathematics not as a body of facts but as a set of problems to be analyzed and resolved.\\n\"There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about the nature of mathematics\", she said, in a 1979 interview. \"They consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of thinking.\" The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.\\nShe teamed up with John Devine, working with teachers in inner-city New York schools. Together they got funding from the Ford Foundation to train teachers from these schools in the methods Lax had pioneered at New York University.\\nThough she was involved with reforming mathematics education for high school and college students in New York, she didn\\'t like panel discussions at conferences, especially when she was meant to reply immediately to preceding remarks by fellow panelists. Anneli said she was a slow listener and reader. She believed her responses were “not ready for public consumption when my turn comes.”\\nAn insert from her writing at the Mathematics as a Humanistic Discipline Session stated:\\n\"I am convinced that the use of language- reading, writing, listening and speaking is essential part of learning anything, and especially mathematics.\" \\nAnneli knew from her experience as teacher, that students learn new material easily when they are able to connect to their past experiences or the outside world. She looked at the mandated syllabi from 6th-8th grade New York middle schools for “integrated math sequences” and she found that because so many topics covered, there was little time for students to connect mathematics outside of the classroom before they were tested.\\nA keystone in Lax\\'s work of reforming education was the emphasis on listening. She taught pre-calculus classes by asking her students to explain the meaning behind exponential functions orally and written accounts of how they solved the problem. She believed listening to the students’ ideas would improve students’ performance and attitude about mathematics.\\nShe was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. In 1993, one of the last projects Lax worked on with her husband was the Parent\\'s Guide. Parent\\'s Guide constructed a basic mathematics list for adults to use to help their children with their schoolwork.\\nIn 1995, the Mathematical Association of America awarded Lax its highest recognition, the Gung-Hu Award for Distinguished Service, for her contributions to mathematical publishing and education in a broad sense.\\nIn 1998, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Anneli Cahn died on September 24, 1999, at the age of 77.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\nIn 1948, Anneli Cahn married her second husband, the mathematician Peter Lax. Anneli Cahn had two sons, John Lax and James Lax. The John Lax Memorial Lecture was created in 1982 by Anneli and Peter, in memory of their son, who taught at Mount Holyoke and died at the age of 27. The Lax Lecture is given by a historian of the highest distinction to commemorate the work and spirit of John Lax by making the latest advances in history accessible to the public. Elena Marchisotto, a family friend, and thesis student, said Anneli spent her last summer in the Adirondacks with her husband and family.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

In collaboration with Robert M. Anderson (economist) and Stephen Bianchi, Goldberg demonstrated that long-horizon performance of risk parity strategies is qualitatively similar to long-horizon performance of traditional strategies after accounting for realistic financing and trading costs, and that risk parity substantially underperforms traditional strategies in certain time periods. Subsequent research by the same team extends the findings to the more general class of dynamically levered strategies, and it reveals high sensitivity of strategy performance to a previously unidentified source of risk:  the co-movement of leverage with return to the underlying portfolio that is levered. They also pointed out that levered strategies involving bonds, including risk parity, are very vulnerable in a rising interest rate environment, the precise environment that many analysts predict for the coming years.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nGoldberg received a Sloan Fellowship in 1987 and a Graham and Dodd Scroll Award for Excellence in Research and Financial Writing in 2012 for Financial Analysts Journal.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGoldberg is married to mathematician Ken Ribet.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Book ===\\nConnor, Gregory; Goldberg, Lisa R.; Korajczyk, Robert A.

She mainly researched algebra, and wrote seventeen research papers on subjects such as nilpotent algebras, division algebras, modular invariants, and the arithmetic of algebras.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nHazlett was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, but grew up in Boston, Massachusetts, where she attended public school. In 1912 she received her bachelor\\'s degree from Radcliffe College. She then attended the University of Chicago for her master\\'s degree (1913) and Ph.D. (1915), for which she wrote a thesis titled On the Classification and Invariantive Characterization of Nilpotent Algebras with L. E. Dickson as thesis advisor. After receiving her doctoral degree Hazlett was awarded an Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship by Harvard, which allowed her to research invariants of nilpotent algebras at Wellesley College for the next year.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn 1916 she was appointed to Bryn Mawr College, where she worked for two years before accepting an appointment as assistant professor at Mount Holyoke College. She was promoted to associate professor in 1924, the same year she gave a talk on The Arithmetic of a General Associative Algebra at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, but in 1925 she left Mount Holyoke because she felt she was not given enough time or resources to pursue her research in algebra. It was then that she took a job as assistant professor at the University of Illinois, where she would spend the rest of her career.\\nIn 1928 Hazlett received a Guggenheim Fellowship that allowed her to spend a year visiting Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. While in Italy she presented a paper called Integers as Matrices to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna. Near the end of her visits she requested an extension of her Guggenheim Fellowship, which was granted and allowed her to spend another year in Europe. When she finally returned to the University of Illinois in 1930, she was promoted to associate professor and received a pay raise. However, her teaching schedule was rigorous and required her to teach service courses to large classes of non-math-majors, and after 1930 she did not publish any more research papers. In 1935 she wrote to the chair of the mathematics department complaining that the service courses left her no time for research, but her teaching schedule was not changed and by December 1936 she took a sick leave after having a mental breakdown from the stress of her job. The sick leave was supposed to end in August 1937, but her health had not improved enough by this time and she took another year off. She was, however, able to return to teaching by the end of 1938.\\nIn 1940, she was appointed a member of the American Mathematical Society\\'s Cryptanalysis Committee, for which she worked until the end of World War II. She maintained her teaching job for most of this period, though, (except for taking leave in 1944-45) and went to great lengths to keep her Cryptanalysis Committee work secret. Her health, however, continued to deteriorate, and in 1946 the University of Illinois placed her on permanent disability leave.\\nIn 1959 she officially retired from the University of Illinois as an Associate Professor Emerita.

              "  'Mary Lee Berners-Lee (née Woods; 12 March 1924 – 29 November 2017) was an English mathematician and computer scientist who worked in a team that developed programs in the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester Mark 1, Ferranti Mark 1 and Mark 1 Star computers. She was the mother of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Mike Berners-Lee, an English researcher and writer on greenhouse gases.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nWoods was born on 12 March 1924, in Hall Green, Birmingham to Ida (née Burrows) and Bertie Woods. Both her parents were teachers. She had a brother who served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was killed in action. She attended Yardley Grammar School in Yardley, Birmingham, where she developed an aptitude for mathematics. From 1942 to 1944, she took a wartime compressed two-year degree course in mathematics at the University of Birmingham. She then worked for the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Malvern until 1946 when she returned to take the third year of her degree. After completing her degree she was offered a fellowship by Richard van der Riet Woolley to work at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, Australia, from 1947 to 1951 when she joined Ferranti in Manchester as a computer programmer.\\n\\n\\n== Ferranti computer programming group ==\\nOn joining the UK and electrical engineering and equipment firm, Ferranti, she started working in a group led by John Makepeace Bennett.\\nShe worked on both the Ferranti Mark 1 and the Ferranti Mark 1 Star computers. The programs for these computers were written in machine code, and there was plenty of room for error because every bit had to be right. The machines used serial 40-bit arithmetic (with a double length accumulator), which meant that there were considerable difficulties in scaling the variables in the program to maintain adequate arithmetic precision.\\n\\nThe Ferranti programming team members found it useful to commit the following sequence of characters to memory, which represented the numbers 0–31 in the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1, which was a 5-bit binary code of the paper tape that was used for input and output: \\nAnother difficulty of programming the Ferranti Mark 1 computers was the two-level storage of the computers. There were eight pages of Williams cathode ray tube (CRT) random access memory as the fast primary store, and 512 pages of the secondary store on a magnetic drum. Each page consisted of thirty-two 40-bit words, which appeared as sixty-four 20-bit lines on the CRTs. The programmer had to control all transfers between electronic and magnetic storage, and the transfers were slow and had to be reduced to a minimum. For programs dealing with large chunks of data, such as matrices, partitioning the data into page-sized chunks could be troublesome.\\n\\nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer worked in integer arithmetic, and the engineers built the computer to display the lines of data on the CRTs with the most significant bit on the right due to their background in radar. This could be argued as the logically sensible choice, but was changed to the more conventional system of the most significant bit on the left for the Mark 1 Star. The Mark 1 Star worked with both fractions and integers. The Baudot teleprinter code was also abandoned for one that was in the following order: \\nProgram errors for the Ferranti Mark 1 computers were difficult to find. Programmers would sit at the computer control desk and watch the computer perform one instruction at a time in order to see where unintended events occurred. However, computer time became more and more valuable, so Dr Bennett suggested that Woods write a diagnostic program to print out the contents of the accumulator and particular store lines at specific points in the program so that error diagnosis could take place away from the computer. The challenge of her routine, \\'Stopandprint\\', was that it had to monitor the program under diagnosis without interfering with it, and the limited space in the fast store made this difficult. Along with Bennet and Dr D.G. Prinz, Woods was involved in writing interpretive subroutines that were used by the Ferranti group.\\nErrors with the programs were one problem, but errors caused by the computer were another. The computer frequently misread the binary digits it was given. The engineers thought the mathematicians could compensate for this by programming arithmetic checks, and the mathematicians would too readily assume that a wrong program result was due to a computer error when it was due to a program error. This caused inevitable friction between the mathematicians and the engineers. At the centre of this was a program that Woods had written for inverting a matrix to solve 40 simultaneous equations, which was a large number for the time. The long rows of data required by this calculation took the computer too long to process without an error. For one dispute Woods went to Tom Kilburn, who was second only to Professor Sir Frederic Calland Williams in the engineering department. Kilburn was polite but did not argue, and she felt he was ignoring her complaint. However, 50 years later when she asked him about the exchange, he said that he had not argued \"because [he] knew [she was] right.\"\\nWhile at Ferranti, Woods discovered that the women in her department were getting less pay than the men. She presented the case to the personnel department and was able to convince them to grant equal pay and rights for women.\\n\\n\\n== Cottage industry programming ==\\nWoods left Ferranti in 1955, when her first child was born. She continued to get involved in smaller programming projects, that she termed \"cottage industry programming,\" so that she could complete jobs from home. Most notably she did some work with the London Transport Executive, to develop a simulation for bus routes that could prevent hold ups and bus bunching. She also developed a program for the RAF at Boscombe Down to track weather balloons and translate their readings. Then she came out of retirement in 1963 to work for a London-based company called K and H. While at K and H she wrote programming manuals until she retired in 1987.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1954 she married Conway Berners-Lee whom she met while working in the Ferranti team, and together they had four children; Timothy (Tim), Peter, Helen and Michael (Mike). Their eldest son, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web, and their youngest son Mike is an academic.\\nAfter a period devoted to bringing up children, she became a schoolteacher of mathematics, and then a programmer using BASIC, Fortran and other languages before retiring in 1987.\\nShe died on 29 November 2017, aged 93.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

While a student in Kyiv in 1948, she was arrested on charges of Ukrainian nationalism, and was a political prisoner in a gulag in Eastern Siberia for six years.\\nOn her return to Kyiv, she was able to return to university in 1956, going on to graduate school in 1961. She went on to study mathematics and become a professor of mathematics at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Virchenko was finally awarded her PhD in 1988, with a dissertation on integral equations. As well as mathematical studies, she has published on the history of mathematics and repressed mathematicians in Ukraine, as well as books for the general public.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNina Virchenko was born on May 5, 1930, in Zavadivka, a village in Ukraine. Her mother was a midwife and her father was a former officer of the Ukrainian People\\'s Army. In 1937, the family moved to Chervone.\\nVirchenko attended Zhytomyr School No. 36. When she was a teenager, she gave herself the pseudonym Ужма (UZHMA), which was an acronym for Ukrainian—Woman—Mathematician—Astronomer. In 1947 at age 16, she passed the entrance examination to Moscow University, but enrolled to study mathematics at the National University of Kyiv (KSU) as her parents did not want her to move so far away. She joined a rocket and aerodynamics group, doing multiple parachute jumps.\\nVirchenko also became involved in the movement for Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union, writing and distributing leaflets, which led to her imprisonment in a gulag for political prisoners from December 1948 to January 1954. When she was released, she was not allowed to return to university, and taught mathematics in village high schools.

She was imprisoned in Lukyanivska Prison. In December, she was sentenced to 10 years\\' prison on political charges, and sent to the Ozerlag gulag for political prisoners in Tayshet, Eastern Siberia. Virchenko\\'s forced labour included logging and working in a stone quarry. Conditions and treatment in the gulag were brutal. Prisoners were given numbers, and names were not used: hers was R-840. There was no radio and no newspapers, and prisoners had no writing paper. Virchenko created poetry, which was shared orally among the prisoners, and she also taught mathematics, drawing in sand or snow with a stick. She was released after six years because she had been convicted as a minor. She and her husband, who was also a former Gulag detainee, were subjected to KGB surveillance in a later wave of repression of Ukrainian academics.\\nVirchenko continued to support fellow prisoners, and were outspoken advocates on rights and the freedom and welfare of political prisoners. Virchenko was the Chair of the scientific and methodological council of the All-Ukrainian Association for Political Prisoners and Victims of Repression. In 2016, Virchenko was one of over 80 former Soviet political prisoners who co-signed an appeal to the Dutch public to vote in favour of the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement.\\nVirchenko had been interested in the work of Ukrainian mathematician Mikhail Kravchuk for some time. When she learned that he had died in a gulag, she began studying his life and mathematical legacy. She wrote a book about him, organized a series of international mathematical meetings in his honor from 1992, the 100th anniversary of his birth, and advocated for a monument in his honor. Virchenko was also the scientific advisor for a documentary Oleksandr Riabokrys, called \"Голгофа академіка Кравчука\" (Academic Kravchuk Calvary).

She was a professor at Lafayette College, where she headed the department of mathematics. Kimber is now the Dean of the College at Washington and Lee University.\\n\\n\\n== Education and career ==\\nKimber, a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, comes from a family of cotton farmers and quilters in Alabama. Although she writes that she \"always loved math\", she began her undergraduate studies at the University of Florida by studying engineering before switching to mathematics because she found it more fulfilling. She earned a master\\'s degree at the University of North Carolina in 1995, as a student of Idris Assani. She returned to the University of Florida for doctoral studies, completing her Ph.D. in 1999. Her dissertation, Prime Ideals in Rings of Continuous Functions, connects abstract algebra with functional analysis and was supervised by Jorge Martinez.\\nAfter a term as Van Vleck Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Wesleyan University, she joined Lafayette College as an assistant professor. In mathematics, she is known for incorporating concepts of social justice into her classroom teaching. She was a Professor and then head of the Math Department. In 2008, she along with Professor Sharon Jones began the Summer Program to Advance Leadership in STEM at Lafayette. This six-week program where incoming students take college level writing and calculus address along with modules in STEM. Students are those who are identified as leaders from groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields. In 2018, Kimber was one of six recipients of the prestigious Clare Booth Luce Scholarship to attend the HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) Institute. While head of the Math Department, the department \"worked to promote an inclusive culture based on the understanding that math is a gateway to many other fields in the sciences, technology and engineering\".\\nIn May 2021, Washington and Lee University announced that Kimber would become the school\\'s Dean of the College effective July 1, 2021.

Kimber began quilting in 2005, soon after completing her application for tenure at Lafayette, and her interest in quilting was renewed in 2007 by the death of her father. Her quilts are influenced by her great-grandmother\\'s work which \"used the same patchwork style as those associated with Gee\\'s Bend\" – Kimber views her work as a \"contemporary adaptation\" of that style. In 2008 she began creating highly politicized quilts and blogging about them, beginning with a series of quilts inspired by George Carlin\\'s seven dirty words and by racist and sexist graffiti on her college campus. Her work has been associated with the \"modern Quilting\" movement, based on its geometric design and provocative content. Her work includes varied subject matter that raise social issues including the killing of African Americans and sexual assault. As well as quilting, Kimber has also exhibited quilting-inspired works of mathematical origami.\\nKimber\\'s quilts are frequently included at quilting shows and museum exhibits of quilting. The Paul Mellon Arts Center put up a show of her works in 2018. One of her quilts inspired by the death of Eric Garner won first place at QuiltCon West in 2016, and was included with other pieces by Kimber in a show on \"Quilts and Human Rights\" at the Pick Museum of Anthropology at Northern Illinois University. Her work, still not, was acquired by the Smithsonian American Art Museum as part of the Renwick Gallery\\'s 50th Anniversary Campaign. This exhibition highlighted that the piece\\'s fabrics were \"sourced from mid-century textiles\". The description stated that \"Kimber\\'s choice to use vintage cloth and improvisational patterns draws on her memories and family history. Many of her enslaved ancestors in rural Alabama cultivated and ginned cotton. Her great-grandmother, Mamo, and other relatives expressed themselves through quilting. [...] Mamo\\'s story was told through her quilts, and Kimber continues the thread\".\\nElizabeth Landau, for The Washington Post in 2020, commented that Kimber \"tries to keep her math and quilting worlds separate. Some of her quilts deliberately rebel against the patterns and orderly structures that dominate math. They are — like jazz music played with fabrics and stitches — improvisational. But the thread of challenging systemic inequalities runs through both of Kimber\\'s endeavors.

              "  'Dorothy Jean Johnson Vaughan (September 20, 1910 – November 10, 2008) was an American mathematician and human computer who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and NASA, at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. In 1949, she became acting supervisor of the West Area Computers, the first African-American woman to receive a promotion and supervise a group of staff at the center.\\nShe later was promoted officially to the position of supervisor. During her 28-year career, Vaughan prepared for the introduction of computers in the early 1960s by teaching herself and her staff the Fortran programming language. She later headed the programming section of the Analysis and Computation Division (ACD) at Langley.\\nVaughan is one of the women featured in Margot Lee Shetterly\\'s history Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016). It was adapted as a biographical film of the same name, also released in 2016.\\nIn 2019, Vaughan was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal posthumously.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nVaughan was born September 20, 1910, in Kansas City, Missouri, as Dorothy Jean Johnson. She was the daughter of Annie and Leonard Johnson. At the age of seven, her family moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, where she graduated from Beechurst High School in 1925 as her class valedictorian. Vaughan received a full-tuition scholarship from West Virginia Conference of the A.M.E. Sunday School Convention to attend Wilberforce University in Wilberforce, Ohio. She joined the Zeta chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at Wilberforce and graduated in 1929 with a B.A. in mathematics. In 1932, she married Howard Vaughan, who died in 1955. The couple moved to Newport News, Virginia, where they had six children: Ann, Maida, Leonard, Kenneth, Michael and Donald. The family also lived with Howard\\'s wealthy and respected parents and grandparents on South Main Street in Newport News, Virginia. Vaughan was very devoted to family and the church, which would play a huge factor in whether she would move to Hampton, Virginia, to work for NASA.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nVaughan graduated from Wilberforce University in 1929. Although encouraged by professors to do graduate study at Howard University, Vaughan worked as a mathematics teacher at Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, in order to assist her family during the Great Depression. During the 14 years of her teaching career, Virginia\\'s public schools and other facilities were still racially segregated under Jim Crow laws.\\nIn 1935, the NACA had established a section of women mathematicians, who performed complex calculations. In 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, to desegregate the defense industry, and Executive Order 9346 to end racial segregation and discrimination in hiring and promotion among federal agencies and defense contractors. These helped ensure the war effort drew from all of American society after the United States entered World War II in 1941. With the enactment of the two Executive Orders, and with many men being swept into service, federal agencies such as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) also expanded their hiring and increased recruiting of women, including women of color, to support the war production of airplanes. Two years following the issuance of Executive Orders 8802 and 9346, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (Langley Research Center), a facility of the NACA, began hiring more black women to meet the drastic increase in demand for processing aeronautical research data. The US believed that the war was going to be won in the air. It had already ramped up airplane production, creating a great demand for engineers, mathematicians, craftsmen and skilled tradesmen.\\nIn 1943, Vaughan began a 28-year-career as a mathematician and programmer at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in which she specialized in calculations for flight paths, the Scout Project, and  computer programming. Her career in this field kicked off during the height of World War II. She came to the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory thinking that it would be a temporary war job. One of her children later worked at NACA. Vaughan was assigned to the West Area Computing, a segregated unit, which consisted of only African Americans. This was due to prevailing Jim Crow laws that required newly hired African American women to work separately from their white women counterparts. They were also required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. This segregated group consisted of African-American women who made complex mathematical calculations by hand, using tools of the time.\\nThe West Computers made contributions to every area of research at Langley. Their work expanded in the postwar years to support research and design for the United States\\' space program, which was emphasized under President John F. Kennedy. In 1949, Vaughan was assigned as the acting head of the West Area Computers, taking over from a white woman who had died. She was the first black supervisor at NACA and one of few female supervisors. She led a group composed entirely of African-American women mathematicians. She served for years in an acting role before being promoted officially to the position as supervisor. Vaughan worked for opportunities for the women in West Computing as well as women in other departments.\\nSeeing that machine computers were going to be the future, she taught the women programming languages and other concepts to prepare them for the transition. Mathematician Katherine Johnson was initially assigned to Vaughan\\'s group, before being transferred to Langley\\'s Flight Mechanics Division. Vaughan moved into the area of electronic computing in 1961, after NACA introduced the first digital (non-human) computers to the center. Vaughan became proficient in computer programming, teaching herself FORTRAN and teaching it to her coworkers to prepare them for the transition. She contributed to the space program through her work on the Scout Launch Vehicle Program. A blog describing her work at NASA is on the Science Museum group website\\nVaughan continued after NASA, the successor agency, was established in 1958. When NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished. In a 1994 interview, Vaughan recalled that working at Langley during the Space Race felt like being on \"the cutting edge of something very exciting\".  Regarding being an African American woman during that time in Langley, she remarked, \"I changed what I could, and what I couldn\\'t, I endured.\" Vaughan worked in the Numerical Techniques division through the 1960s. Dorothy Vaughan and many of the former West Computers joined the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group on the frontier of electronic computing. She worked at NASA-Langley for 28 years.\\nDuring her career at Langley, Vaughan was also raising her six children, one of whom later also worked at NASA-Langley. Vaughan lived in Newport News, Virginia, and commuted to work at Hampton via public transportation.\\n\\n\\n== Later years ==\\n\\nVaughan wanted to continue at another management position at NASA, but never received an offer. She retired from NASA in 1971, at the age of 61. In her final decade of her career, she worked with mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson and Mary Jackson on astronaut John Glenn\\'s launch into orbit. She died on November 10, 2008, aged 98. Vaughan was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, an African-American sorority. She was also an active member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church where she participated in music and missionary activities. She also wrote a song called \"Math Math\".\\nAt the time of her death, she was survived by four of her six children, ten grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nVaughan was the first respected Black female manager at NASA, thus creating a long-lasting legacy for diversity in mathematics and science for West Area Computers. As one of the first female coders in the field who knew how to code FORTRAN, she was able to instruct other Black women on the coding language and paved a wave of female programmers to integrate their work into NASA’s systems.\\nIn 2005, a scholarship fund with the Salem Community Foundation was created under Dorothy Vaughan’s name to further music training by the Salem Music Study Club.\\nVaughan is one of the women featured in Margot Lee Shetterly\\'s 2016 non-fiction book Hidden Figures, and the feature film of the same name. She was portrayed by the Academy Award winning actress Octavia Spencer.\\nThe Dorothy J. Vaughan Academy of Technology opened in Charlotte, NC, in August 2017. This school is inspired by Vaughan’s “leadership, innovation, creativity, curiosity, and love of learning.” The school is a member of the Magnet Schools of America Association.\\nIn 2019, Vaughan was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.  Also in 2019, the Vaughan crater on the far side of the Moon was named in her honor.\\nOn 6 November 2020, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 12 or \"Dorothy\", COSPAR 2020-079D of the ÑuSat series) was launched into space.\\nVaughan’s personal Bible and NASA retirement identification card are displayed in the Museum of the Bible’s exhibition Scripture and Science: Our Universe, Ourselves, Our Place.

              "  'Sheila Christina Tinney (née Power; 15 January 1918 – 27 March 2010) was an Irish mathematical physicist. Her 1941 PhD from the University of Edinburgh, completed under the supervision of Max Born in just two years, is believed to make her the first Irish-born and -raised woman to receive a doctorate in the mathematical sciences.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\nSheila Christina Power was the fourth of six children born in Galway city to Michael Power [a.k.a. Mícheál de Paor, originally from rural Kilkenny, Chair of Mathematics at University College Galway (UCG) from 1912 to 1955] and Christina Cunniffe (who died in childbirth when Sheila was 12). She was educated by the Dominican nuns, both in Galway and in Dublin, and was awarded Honours in Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate Examination (the nation\\'s secondary school exit exam), one of only 8 girls to do so in the whole country. After one year attending UCG, she switched to University College Dublin (UCD), from which she graduated with a BSc in 1938, with First Class Honours in Mathematics, and ranked at the top of her class. She did her Master\\'s at UCD in 1939, and was subsequently awarded a National University of Ireland travelling studentship, which enabled her to undertake research at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.  Two years later, in 1941, she earned her doctorate under the supervision of the celebrated physicist Max Born on the stability of crystal lattices.\\nReturning to Dublin, she became an assistant lecturer at University College Dublin, and was also one of the first three scholars appointed to the brand new Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS), in October 1941. While at the DIAS she worked with Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington and Erwin Schrödinger. She developed a great interest in quantum physics, and wrote papers with Schrödinger, Hideki Yukawa, and Walter Heitler. She remained at DIAS (on a part-time basis) until the summer of 1948. From September 1948 to June 1949 she took a leave of absence from UCD and was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton where worked in an environment that included Freeman Dyson, Hermann Weyl, Harish-Chandra, and Albert Einstein.\\nShe developed the first mathematical courses on quantum mechanics at UCD and taught the subject to generations of students there, until her early retirement in 1979.\\nIn 1952, she married Seán Tinney, a former engineering student she had lectured, and the couple\\'s three children include classical pianist Hugh Tinney.\\n\\n\\n== Pioneer and role model for women in academia ==\\n\\nBy 1900 the campaign for the acceptance of women in academia was largely successful, and even Trinity College Dublin began admitting women in 1904.  But the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) threw up legal obstacles and did not bow to the inevitable until 1949 when it finally admitted four women–one of them Sheila Tinney. In 2016 the RIA honoured Tinney by hanging her portrait along with 11 other female academic leaders on its walls.\\nEven at University College Dublin, Tinney faced the entrenched prejudice against women.  One professor emeritus recalls the sympathy she received when, early in her career, she was passed over for promotion in favour of a younger, and demonstrably less academically qualified, male colleague.  During her time at UCD she gained a reputation for helping younger female colleagues who were trying to develop their careers.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nThe special medal cast for the 25 Global Winners of The Undergraduate Awards in 2016 (presented 10 November in Dublin) honoured Sheila Tinney, \"trail-blazing and brilliant academic, who achieved astounding success through self-belief and determination.\" In 2016, the RIA unveiled a portrait of Tinney by Vera Klute as part of the Women on Walls exhibition. In August 2018, a plaque was unveiled in UCD in honour of Tinney.\\nA new portrait of the pioneering mathematical physicist Dr. Sheila Tinney was unveiled at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS) on 15 January 2019 to mark the 101st anniversary of her birth. The portrait – by artist Judith Henihan – was acquired by DIAS thanks to support from the International Women\\'s Forum (Ireland) and benefactors from the ‘Friends of DIAS’ initiative.\\n\\n\\n== Papers ==\\nHeitler, W.; Power, S.

              "  \"Jenny Harrison is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.\\n\\n\\n== Education and career ==\\nHarrison grew up in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. On graduating from the University of Alabama, she won a Marshall Scholarship which she used to fund her graduate studies at the University of Warwick. She completed her doctorate there in 1975, supervised by Christopher Zeeman. Hassler Whitney was her postdoctoral adviser at the Institute for Advanced Study, and she was also one of the Miller Research Fellows at Berkeley.  She was on the tenured faculty at the University of Oxford (Somerville College) from 1978 to 1981, before returning to Berkeley as an assistant professor.\\nIn 1986, after being denied tenure at Berkeley, Harrison filed a lawsuit based on gender discrimination. Stephen Smale and Robion Kirby were the most vocal opponents to her receiving tenure during the case, while Morris Hirsch and James Yorke were her most vocal supporters.  The 1993 settlement led to a new review of her work by a panel of seven mathematicians and science faculty who unanimously recommended tenure as a full professor.\\n\\n\\n== Research contributions ==\\nHarrison specializes in geometric analysis and areas in the intersection of algebra, geometry, and geometric measure theory.  She introduced and  developed with collaborators a theory of generalized functions called differential chains that unifies an infinitesimal calculus with the classical theory of the smooth continuum, a long outstanding problem.   The infinitesimals are constructive and arise from methods of standard analysis, as opposed to the nonstandard analysis of Abraham Robinson. The methods apply equally well to domains such as soap films, fractals,  charged particles, and Whitney stratified spaces,  placing them on the same footing as smooth submanifolds in the resulting calculus.  The results include optimal generalizations and simplifications of the theorems of Stokes, Gauss and Green.  She has pioneered applications of differential chains  to the calculus of variations, physics, and continuum mechanics.  Her solution to Plateau's problem is the first proof of existence of a solution to a universal Plateau's problem for finitely many boundary curves, taking into account all soap films arising in nature, including nonorientable films with triple junctions, as well as solutions of Jesse Douglas,  Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming.\\nAs a graduate student at the University of Warwick, where Zeeman introduced her to Plateau's problem. She found a counterexample to the Seifert conjecture at Oxford. In a Berkeley seminar in 1983 she proposed the existence of a general theory linking these together, and  the theory of differential chains began to evolve. Jenny Harrison and Harrison Pugh proved that the topological vector space of differential chains satisfies a universal property determined by two natural axioms. They used the theory to provide the first universal solution to Plateau's problem, including soap film regularity, building upon Harrison's earlier paper.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and fellowships ==\\n\\nFoundational Questions Institute, research award, 2009\\nMiller Institute for Basic Research in Science, Miller Professor, 2007\\nRockefeller University, Visiting Research Professor, 1996–97\\nYale University, National Science Foundation, Visiting Scholar, 1989–90\\nOxford University, CUF Lecturer and Tutorial Fellow, Somerville College, 1978–81\\nMiller Institute for Basic Research in Science, Miller Fellow, 1977–78\\nInstitute for Advanced Study, Visiting Fellow, Princeton, 1975–76\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nHarrison's webpage\\nJenny Harrison at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\",\n",
              "  'Hilda Geiringer (28 September 1893 – 22 March 1973), also known as Hilda von Mises and Hilda Pollaczek-Geiringer, was an Austrian mathematician.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nGeiringer was born in 1893 in Vienna, Austria into a Jewish family. Her father, Ludwig Geiringer, was born in Hungary and her mother, Martha Wertheimer, was from Vienna. Her parents had married while her father was working in Vienna as a textile manufacturer.\\n\\n\\n=== University of Vienna ===\\nWhile still in high school, Geiringer showed great mathematical ability. Her parents supported her financially so that she could study mathematics at the University of Vienna. After receiving her first degree, Geiringer continued her study of mathematics in Vienna. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1917 under the guidance of Wilhelm Wirtinger with a thesis entitled \"Trigonometrische Doppelreihen\" about Fourier series in two variables. She spent the following two years as Leon Lichtenstein\\'s assistant editing the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik, a mathematics review journal.\\n\\n\\n=== Berlin Institute of Applied Mathematics ===\\nIn 1921, Geiringer moved to Berlin where she was employed as an assistant to Richard Edler von Mises at the Institute of Applied Mathematics. In this same year, she married Felix Pollaczek who, like Geiringer, was born in Vienna into a Jewish family and had studied in Berlin. Pollaczek obtained his doctorate in 1922 and went on to work for the Reichspost (Postal service) in Berlin, applying mathematical methods to telephone connections. Hilda and Felix had a child, Magda, in 1922, but their marriage broke up. After the divorce, Geiringer continued working for von Mises and at the same time raised her child.\\nAlthough trained as a pure mathematician, Geiringer moved towards applied mathematics to fit in with the work being undertaken at the Institute of Applied Mathematics. Her work at this time was on statistics, probability theory, and also on the mathematical theory of plasticity. She submitted a thesis for her Habilitation to qualify as an instructor at the University of Berlin, but it was not immediately accepted. Geiringer lost the right to teach at the university in December 1933. In fact, she had been proposed for appointment to the position of extraordinary professor in 1933 but the proposal had been ”put on hold” once the Civil Service Law came into effect two months after Adolf Hitler attained power. This law disqualified Jews from serving as teachers, professors, judges, or in other government positions. Geiringer left Germany after she was dismissed from the University of Berlin, and, with Magda, she went to Brussels. There she was appointed to the Institute of Mechanics and began to apply mathematics to the theory of vibrations.\\n\\n\\n=== Istanbul ===\\nIn 1934, Geiringer followed von Mises to Istanbul where she had been appointed as Professor of Mathematics and continued to research in applied mathematics, statistics, and probability theory. While in Turkey, Geiringer became intrigued with the basic principles of genetics formulated by the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel. Between 1935 and 1939, she was preoccupied with uses for the theory of probability to which she and von Mises had made major, early contributions. Arguably Hilda Geiringer was one of the pioneers of what emerged as the burgeoning disciplines bearing such names as molecular genetics, human genetics, plant genetics, heredity in man, genomics, bioinformatics, biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and genetic engineering, among others. The world has not given sufficient credit to this intelligent woman\\'s pioneering work mainly because it was done in Istanbul and published in Turkish journals. \\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nFollowing Atatürk’s death in 1938, Geiringer and her daughter went to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in the United States, where she was appointed to a lecturer position. In addition to her lecturing duties at Bryn Mawr College, Geiringer undertook, as part of the war effort, classified work for the United States National Research Council.\\nDuring 1942, she gave an advanced summer course in mechanics at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, with the aim of raising the American standards of education to the level that had been attained in Germany. She wrote up her outstanding series of lectures on the geometrical foundations of mechanics and, although they were never properly published, these were widely disseminated and used in the United States for many years. To this day, even though Brown University never offered Geiringer permanent employment, the university takes full birthplace credit for these “mimeographed notes.”\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage to Richard Edler von Mises ===\\nGeiringer and von Mises married in 1943 and, the following year, she left her part-time, low-pay lecturing post at Bryn Mawr College to be nearer to him and because the Wheaton College offered her her first permanent position in the USA. She accepted a post as Professor and Chairman of the Mathematics Department at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. During the week, she taught at the college, then traveled to Cambridge every weekend to be with von Mises.\\nFor many reasons, this was not a good arrangement. There were only two members of the mathematics faculty at Wheaton College and Geiringer longed for a situation where she was among mathematicians who were carrying out research.\\n\\n\\n=== Discrimination ===\\nGeiringer applied for positions at other New England universities, but these applications failed due to fairly open discrimination against women. Discrimination against Jewish mathematicians was also a factor. However, she took it all remarkably calmly, believing that if she could do something for future generations of women then she would have achieved something positive. She also never gave up her research while at Wheaton College. In 1953 she wrote: \\n\\n\"have to work scientifically, besides my college work. This is a necessity for me; I never stopped it since my student days, it is the deepest need of my life.\"\\nOne response to a job application she received was quite typical: \\n\\n\"I am sure that our President would not approve of a woman. We have some women on our staff, so it is not merely prejudice against women, yet it is partly that, for we do not want to bring in more if we can get men.\"\\nOn 23 June 1939, Harvard University’s astronomy professor Harlow Shapley wrote on her behalf to Radcliffe College which operated as Harvard’s sister school. Though it drew instructors and other resources from Harvard, Radcliffe graduates were not granted Harvard degrees until 1963. Even though Geiringer was a better mathematician and a better teacher than Harvard could provide to the women at Radcliffe, Geiringer was never offered a real job by either.\\nIn a letter dated 7 March 1941, Oswald Veblen, writing in her behalf, stated: \"You know of course that there is more and more demand for knowledge of statistics in several sciences. It is very desirable that when possible the courses in statistics should be given by people who are well-grounded mathematically as well as interested in its applications. Teachers who satisfy both of these conditions are by no means common.\" He concluded that thought with \"Mrs. Geiringer is perhaps the only woman who satisfies both conditions.\" Three days later, Hermann Weyl wrote: \"In her field of applied mathematics, and especially in mathematical statistics, she is a first-rate scholar of great experience and accomplishment.\" He then added, \"in my opinion applied mathematics, which forms the bridge from abstract mathematics to the more concrete neighbor sciences, has up to now been unduly neglected in this country; that in the present circumstances its importance has increased considerably.\"\\nAs late as 28 May 1943 she wrote to Hermann Weyl at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. “I am certainly conscious of the fact that it is hard for a refugee + woman to find something. Nevertheless I have not quite given up hope. I need not say that a research position would be just as welcome to me as teaching.” “I hope there will be better conditions for the next generations of women,” she wrote. “In the meantime, one has to go on as well as possible.”\\n\\n\\n=== Work at Harvard ===\\nIn 1953, Richard von Mises died and the following year Geiringer, although retaining her job at Wheaton College, began to work at Harvard, completing and editing many of von Mises’ unfinished works, with the help of von Mises\\' student Geoffrey S. S. Ludford. To do this, however, she had to secure a grant from the Office of Naval Research and it was then that Harvard offered her a temporary position as a Research Fellow in Mathematics. In the archives at Harvard University, there are eight boxes bearing the caption “MISES, HILDA VON ( Mrs. Richard von Mises, known professionally as Hilda Geiringer ) (Applied Mathematics)” HUG 4574.142. The contents of these boxes involve only professional matters such as her “speeches and variants of published works…a few related letters and two notebooks. Boxes 2 and 3 contain manuscripts relating to published items and have numbers referring to the bibliography in HUG 4574.160.” In 1959, Geiringer was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1956, the University of Berlin, perhaps to assuage group guilt, perhaps to add a luminary name to its roster, elected her Professor Emeritus and placed her on full salary. In 1959, she formally retired from Wheaton College and, in the following year, that College honored her with the award of an honorary Doctorate of Science. She was also a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"The woman who reshaped maths: She fled the Nazis, only to face a new challenge: being accepted in academia\", Leila McNeill, October 31, 2019, BBC\\n\"Hilda Geiringer von Mises\", Biographies of Women Mathematicians, Agnes Scott College',\n",

              "  'Jo Boaler (born 18 February 1964) is a British education author and Nomellini-Olivier Professor of Mathematics Education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. Boaler is involved in promoting reform mathematics and equitable mathematics classrooms. She is the co-founder and faculty director of youcubed a Stanford centre that offers mathematics education resources to teachers, students and parents. She is the author, co-author or editor of eighteen mathematics books, including Limitless Mind, Mathematical Mindsets, The Elephant in the Classroom  and What\\'s Math Got To Do With It?.\\n\\n\\n== Early Life and Education ==\\nJo Boaler grew up outside of Birmingham England. Her mother was a secretary, and her father was a technical draftsman. Boaler\\'s early math classes were largely mundane until an iconoclastic teacher introduced her class to a more nurturing and collaborative way to learn math. Boaler received a Bachelors in Psychology from Liverpool University in 1985. Boaler then began her career as a secondary mathematics teacher in urban London secondary schools, including Haverstock School, Camden. After her early career in secondary mathematics education, Boaler received a master\\'s degree in Mathematics Education from King\\'s College London with distinction in 1991. She completed her PhD in mathematics education at the same university and won the award for best PhD in education from the British Educational Research Association in 1997.\\n\\n\\n== Academic career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\nDuring the early part of Boaler\\'s career, she conducted longitudinal studies of students learning mathematics through different approaches. Her first three-year study in England was published as \"Experiencing School Mathematics: Teaching Styles, Sex, and Setting.\" In 1998, Boaler became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics Education at Stanford University in the Graduate School of Education. She became an associate professor in 2000 and left as a full professor in 2006.\\nIn 2000, she was awarded a Research on Learning Award from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for a longitudinal study in California. Boaler\\'s NSF funded study would come to be known as the Railside study and studies the outcomes acros three schools in northern California. The goal of the study was to compare the impact of traditional math curriculum with the reform curriculum. The findings were published in 2008. The findings were promising and were used to support further reform efforts.\\nStanford mathematician R. James Milgram, CSULA professor Wayne Bishop, and statistician Paul Clopton investigated Boaler\\'s claims and wrote an essay stating that her claims were exaggerated. In 2006, Milgram accused Boaler of research misconduct. Stanford\\'s investigation concluded by acknowledging ongoing debates in mathematics education and absolving Boaler of scientific misconduct stating that \"Dr. Boaler\\'s responses to the questions put to her related to her report were thorough, thoughtful, and offered her scientific rationale for each of the questions underlying the allegations. We found no evidence of scientific misconduct or fraudulent behavior related to the content of the report in question. In short, we find that the allegations (such as they are) of scientific misconduct do not have substance\".\\n\\n\\n=== Return to England ===\\nIn 2006 Boaler left Stanford for the UK. She was awarded a posting as the Marie Curie professor at Sussex University by the Marie Curie Foundation. While in England, Boaler authored two books, What\\'s Math Got To Do With It? and The Elephant in the Classroom.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to California ===\\nIn 2010, Boaler returned to Stanford and resumed her position as Professor of Mathematics Education. In 2013, Boaler taught the first Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on mathematics education, called \"How to Learn Math\". Its purpose was to educate teachers and parents about a new way of teaching math to help students overcome their fear of math while improving their academic performance. Over 40,000 teachers and parents participated, with about 25,000 completing the full 2-to-16-hour course. At the end of the course, 95% of survey respondents indicated that they would modify their ways of teaching math.\"How to Learn Math\". Stanford Lagunita. Archived from the original on 6 June 2019.</ref>\\nIn addition to focusing on inquiry-based learning, Boaler\\'s research has highlighted the problems associated with ability grouping in England and the US. In 2012, Boaler published articles on the links between timed testing and math anxiety. Boaler had conducted research on mathematics, mistakes, and growth mindset. In 2012 Boaler published an article on her Stanford homepage, accusing Milgram, Bishop (and others) of harassment, persecution, and suppression. Bishop and Milgram each issued rebuttals.\\nIn 2013, Boaler founded youcubed.org with Cathy Williams, former director of Mathematics in the Vista Unified School District. The mission of the site is to offer inspirational mathematics resources for mathematics teachers.\\nIn 2014, the San Francisco Unified School District updated its math program, including removal of algebra from their public middle schools. The effort removed honors classes and accelerated math, placing all students into the same curriculum based on grade. The replacement curriculum was heavily based on Boaler\\'s work, and had groups of students work through a series of math tasks. In an Op-Ed signed by Boaler and several colleagues, the group praised the effort, claiming the repeat rate for 9th grade algebra dropped from 40% to 8%. However, a school district spokesperson reportedly later clarified that those numbers were not related to curriculum changes, but rather it was a \"one-time major drop\" that occurred when placement tests were removed.\\nAs Common Core was being launched in 2015, Boaler pointed out that fluency is often taken to mean memorization and speed. This ignited a controversy in England, prompting Charlie Stripp, director of England\\'s National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics to respond in an op-ed.\\n\\n\\n=== 2023 California Math Framework ===\\nBoaler is one of the original authors of the California Department of Education\\'s controversial Mathematics Framework. Based on the work Boaler and Youcubed, among others, the framework faced considerable criticism and pushback. Following years of delays the framework was finally approved in July 2023 by the state board of education after changes recommended by WestEd were integrated into the document.\\nIn March 2024 an anonymous complaint was sent to Stanford\\'s dean of research alleging Boaler had violated the research policies of the university. Boaler\\'s work on the 2023 revision of the California Math Curriculum Framework was alleged to contain numerous misrepresentations and inaccuracies. In response, Boaler said that the accusations demonstrated \"a lack of understanding of educational research protocols and processes.\" As with the earlier complaint from 2006, the university declined to investigate the matter, stating that the allegations were reviewed and they \"reflect scholarly disagreement and interpretation.\"\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\n2000 – 2004 President: International Organisation of Women and Mathematics Education (IOWME)\\n2014 NCSM (National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics) Kay Gilliland Equity Award\\n2016 The California Mathematics Council Walter Denham Memorial Award for Leadership\\n2019 The Nomellini-Olivier Endowed Chair\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

              "  'Mark Wallinger (born 25 May 1959) is an English artist. Having previously been nominated for the Turner Prize in 1995, he won in 2007 for his installation State Britain. His work Ecce Homo (1999–2000) was the first piece to occupy the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. He represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2001. Labyrinth (2013), a permanent commission for Art on the Underground, was created to celebrate 150 years of the London Underground. In 2018, the permanent work Writ in Water was realized for the National Trust to celebrate where Magna Carta was signed at Runnymede. \\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Education and artistic career ===\\n\\nWallinger was born in Chigwell, Essex, on 25 May 1959. He trained at the Chelsea School of Art in London, from 1978 to 1981, before studying for an MA from Goldsmiths, University of London from 1983 to 1985. After graduating in 1985, most of his degree show was exhibited by the Anthony Reynolds Gallery, and he continued to teach part-time at Goldsmiths.\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\nIn 1998, Wallinger won the Henry Moore Fellowship, British School at Rome, an award offered to outstanding scholars and artists with the opportunity to work in Rome for 3 to 12 months. In 2001, Wallinger was honored with the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program, one of the world\\'s most respected artist-in-residence programmes for established artists working in the fine arts, film, literature and music. The following year he received an Honorary Fellowship from the London Institute.\\nIn 2003, Wallinger was the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Central England in Birmingham, UK. In 2007, he was awarded the Turner Prize. In 2009, Goldsmith College honoured Wallinger for his achievements which reflect the values important to the Goldsmiths community. In the same year Wallinger’s design was selected from a three-strong shortlist for the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project Commission. In 2010, he presented Sinema Amnesia in Çanakkale as part of “My City”, a project which invited five artists from five European countries to produce installations in different Turkish cities.\\nAs part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Mark Wallinger\\'s Labyrinth work was elected by Londoners as one of the 10 favourite transport design icons.\\nIn 2019, Writ in Water, a major architectural artwork by Mark Wallinger, in collaboration with Studio Octopi, for the National Trust at Runnymede, Surrey, was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize. In the same year, the project won the RIBA South East Award, the RIBA National Award, the Civic Trust Awards Commendation, MacEwen Award Shortlisting and EUMies Award Nomination, and the Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Fountains or Water features by The Public Statues and Sculptures Association in 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Turner Prize ==\\nMark Wallinger was awarded the 2007 Turner Prize for State Britain, a direct meticulous replica and reconstruction of Brian Haw’s protest peace camp outside the Houses of Parliament against policies towards Iraq. The installation occupied the entire length of Tate Britain’s Duveen Galleries, consisting of more than 600 banners, flags, teddy bears, peace signs, Haw’s tarpaulin shelter, and other materials amassed by Haw over his years of protest. The original display consisted of donations from the public, including paintings, banners and toys. This had been confiscated by the police under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. He also put a black line on the floor of the Tate and through the middle of his exhibit to mark part of a 1 kilometre exclusion zone from Parliament Square.  The jury applauded the work for its “immediacy, visceral intensity and historic importance” integrating “a bold political statement with art’s ability to articulate fundamental human truths”. The art historian Yve-Alain Bois described State Britain as “one of the most remarkable political works of art ever”.\\nOn speaking to the BBC about the award, Wallinger added, \"I am indebted to all those people who contributed to the making of State Britain. Brian Haw is a remarkable man who has waged a tireless campaign against the folly and hubris of our government’s foreign policy. For six-and-a-half years he has remained steadfast in Parliament Square, the last dissenting voice in Britain. Bring home the troops, give us back our rights, trust the people.\"\\nIn 2011 the artwork was exhibited for the first time in the Netherlands at the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art.\\n\\n\\n== Venice Biennale ==\\nIn 2001, the British Council revealed that they had selected Mark Wallinger to produce a solo show of new and past artworks for the British Pavilion at the 49th Venice Biennale. The show included sculpture, video, painting, and photography.\\nWallinger presented the site-specific work, Facade (2001), which wrapped the front of the British Pavilion with an identical size replica colour photograph of the Pavilion itself printed on vinyl-coated material attached from scaffolding. In front of the pavilion Oxymoron (1996) was flying from a flagpole, a flag with the British Union Jack replaced by green and orange of the Irish flag colours. In addition to Angel (1997), Threshold to the Kingdom (2000), Life Class (2001), Ghost (2001), and Time and Relative Dimensions in Space (2001), the sculpture Ecce Homo (1999-2000), first presented on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, in 2000, welcomed visitors into the main gallery.\\nGhost (2001) continued with Wallinger’s fixation and exploration of British horse racing traditions. It consisted of a negative reproduction image in a lightbox showing the famous 18th-century oil painting, Whistlejacket (c.1762) by George Stubbs, but altered by adding a horn on its head, thus turning it into a unicorn. In contrast, Time and Relative Dimensions in Space (2001) referred to the space-traveling machine from the British show Doctor Who. Recreated especially for the biennale, Wallinger delivered a reflective mirrored replica of the famous police box. \\n\\n\\n== Later work ==\\nWallinger\\'s later work appears to have largely turned away from his earlier preoccupations, instead apparently focusing on religion and death and the influence of William Blake. \"Angel\" is a video played in reverse showing the artist walking backwards at the bottom of the down escalator at Angel Underground Station while reciting the opening lines of the Gospel of John in the King James Bible. At the conclusion of the video the music of Zadok the Priest that forms part of the British Coronation ceremony can be heard as Wallinger \\'ascends\\' up the stairs. No Man\\'s Land, a show at the Whitechapel Gallery included several works on these subjects. Threshold to the Kingdom (2000), for example, is a slow motion video of people coming through automatic double doors at international arrivals at an airport. The video is accompanied by a recording of the famous Miserere by Gregorio Allegri. Wallinger has said that the title might be taken as a double meaning: arrival at the United Kingdom, but also at the kingdom of heaven, with a security guard playing the part of St. Peter.\\nThe largest work in the No Man\\'s Land show was Prometheus. This piece is in two parts – on the outside, in a dark corridor, is a video of Wallinger (or rather his alter-ego, \"Blind Faith\") sitting in an electric chair and singing Ariel\\'s song from William Shakespeare\\'s The Tempest. From the corridor, automatic double doors give access to a brightly lit room which has an electric chair bolted to one of the walls, giving a top-down \"God\\'s-eye view\" of it. On two facing walls are large photos of fists with the words \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" written on them, a reference to the preacher played by Robert Mitchum in the film, The Night of the Hunter, who had similar tattoos on his knuckles. A circular steel loop gives out a continuous buzzing sound.\\nEcce Homo was the first work to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. This work is a life-sized statue of a Christ figure, naked apart from a loin cloth, and with his hands bound behind his back. He wears a crown of barbed wire. The sculpture was placed at the very front edge of the massive plinth, emphasising its vulnerability and relative smallness. It was quite popular with the public and was later shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, where Wallinger was Britain\\'s representative.\\nHe was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Ebbsfleet Landmark Project in January 2008, and in February 2009 it was announced that his design had won the competition. Wallinger\\'s design is of a giant white horse modelled on another of his own racehorses, \\'Riviera Red\\', and has been described by his supporters as \"an absolutely mesmerising conflation of old England and new, of the semi-mythical, Tolkienesque past and the six-lanes, all-crawling present\".\\nHe curated the exhibition \"The Russian Linesman: Frontiers, Borders and Thresholds\" at the Hayward Gallery in London, which lasted from February to May 2009.\\n\\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Mark Wallinger would be one of three artists (along with Chris Ofili and Conrad Shawcross) to collaborate with the Royal Ballet and the National Gallery to create a piece based on works by the Renaissance painter Titian. Titian Metamorphosis, which documented the entire project from conception to finished performances, was published by London-based publisher Art / Books in two editions in January 2013.\\nIn February 2013, it was announced that Wallinger had created Labyrinth a set of 270 enamel plaques of unicursal labyrinth designs, one for every London tube station, to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground; each will be numbered according to its position in the route taken by the contestants in the 2009 Guinness World Record Tube Challenge. In October 2014, Art / Books published Labyrinth: A Journey Through London\\'s Underground by Mark Wallinger, a comprehensive photographic book of all 270 labyrinth designs in situ in the Underground stations.\\nIn 2019 Wallinger displayed his sculpture entitled The World Turned Upside Down at the London School of Economics. The artwork attracted controversy for showing the island of Taiwan as a sovereign entity, rather than as part of the People’s Republic of China. After dueling protests by students from both the PRC and ROC and reactions by third party observers (which included the President of Taiwan, Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the co-chairs of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group in the House of Commons) the university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which chromatically displayed the PRC and ROC as different entities but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution\\'s position regarding the controversy.\\nIn October 2019, Wallinger featured in a group show at Tension Fine Art alongside artists Julian Lowe and Stuart Elliot. The show \"You Can\\'t Tell By Looking\" was curated by Kate Love.\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nMark Wallinger at Hauser & Wirth\\nMark Wallinger at carlier | gebauer\\nMark Wallinger\\'s work in the Tate\\nMark Wallinger in the 1995 Turner Prize, Tate web site\\nMark Wallinger on State Britain (video)\\nExcerpt from Wallinger\\'s Sleeper video\\n\\'A Number of Disappearances\\', essay by Richard Grayson for Mark Wallinger\\'s Aargauer Kunsthaus catalogue, published by JRP|Ringier, Switzerland 2008',\n",
              "  'Jevel Demikovski (March 27, 1922 – February 4, 2007), known professionally as Jules Olitski, was an American painter, printmaker, and sculptor.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nOlitski was born Jevel Demikovsky in Snovsk, in Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine), a few months after his father, a commissar, was executed by the Soviet government. He emigrated to the United States in 1923 with his mother and grandmother and settled in Brooklyn. His grandmother cared for him while his mother worked to support the family. In 1926 his mother married Hyman Olitsky (note \"y\" ending), a widower with two sons. A daughter was born in 1930.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nOlitski showed an aptitude for drawing and by 1935 was taking occasional art classes in Manhattan. He attended public schools in New York, winning an art prize upon his graduation from high school. At an exhibit of the work of some of the great masters at the New York World\\'s Fair in 1939 he was very impressed by Rembrandt\\'s portraits. Subsequently he won a scholarship to study art at Pratt Institute and was admitted to the National Academy of Design in New York. His education continued at Beaux Arts Institute in New York from 1940-42.\\nAfter discharge from the Army in 1945, Olitski married and stayed with Leo and Alma Gershenson in Asheville, North Carolina. After some time, on Leo\\'s advice, he traveled to Mexico. He later returned to New York, and then in the late 1940s went to Paris on the G.I. Bill, studying at the Ossip Zadkine School and the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. In Paris he saw the European modern masters and engaged in severe self-analysis, which involved painting while blindfolded to remove himself from all of his customary habits and facility. Olitski presented his first one-man show in Paris in 1951.\\nHaving returned to New York in 1951, Olitski received his B.A. in 1952 and his M.A. in 1954 in art education, both from New York University.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nOlitski had his first one-person show at Galerie Huit, Paris in 1951. He returned to New York, and reacting against the color and imagery of his Paris works, began to paint monochromatic pictures with empty centers. He divorced and began exhibiting in group shows, and by 1956 was remarried and had joined the faculty of C. W. Post College on Long Island. In 1958 he had his first New York one-person show, at the Zodiac Room of the Alexander Iolas Gallery, and met Clement Greenberg, who exhibited Olitski\\'s paintings in a large solo show at French & Company in May 1959.\\nIn 1960 Olitski abruptly moved away from the heavily encrusted abstract surfaces he had evolved and began to stain the canvas with large areas of thin, brightly colored dyes. These were shown at a second French & Co. exhibit, in April 1961, and he was asked to join the Poindexter Gallery, where he had several exhibitions. Thereafter he exhibited in numerous venues, won a prize at the Carnegie International, and began to be collected by museums.\\nBy 1965 Olitski had evolved a radically innovative technique of laying down atmospheric blankets of colored spray on the canvas, marked at first by barely discernible straight-edged value changes near the edge of the picture and later by acrylic paint dragged along portions of the edge. He exhibited internationally in the late 1960s and was selected as one of four artists to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1966. In 1969 he was invited to exhibit large, aluminum, spray-painted sculptures at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, becoming the first living American artist to be given a one-person exhibition there.\\nHe taught at Bennington College from 1963 to 1967.\\nIn the 1970s Olitski returned to the thick impasto surfaces that characterized his work in the 1950s but with innovative techniques that took advantage of the newly improved polymer and gel acrylic mediums. In 1994 he was elected into the National Academy of Design.\\nHis late works from 2001 to 2007 are characterized by intensely colored orbs that can evoke landscape or skyscape. Norman L. Kleeblat wrote in the catalog that accompanied the exhibition Jules Olitski-The Late Paintings-A Celebration, at Knoedler and Company: \"The intensity of Olitski\\'s colors can feel jarring when each colored area is observed separately. But the artist is a master of unlikely clashes of intense and artificial-looking colors recalling Delacroix.\"\\nOlitski had over 150 one-person exhibitions in his lifetime and is represented in museums worldwide. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Hartford, Keene State College, and Southern New Hampshire University. The Estate of Jules Olitski is represented by YaresArt.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nOlitski lived and worked in studios in New Hampshire and Florida and exhibited regularly until his death from cancer in 2007, aged 84.\\nFamily\\n1945.

              "  'Wangechi Mutu (born 1972) is a Kenyan American visual artist, known primarily for her painting, sculpture, film, and performance work. Born in Kenya, Mutu now splits her time between her studio there in Nairobi and her studio in Brooklyn, New York, where she  has lived and worked for over 20 years. Mutu\\'s work has directed the female body as subject through collage painting, immersive installation, and live and video performance while exploring questions of self-image, gender constructs, cultural trauma, and environmental destruction and notions of beauty and power.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nMutu was born in 1972 in Nairobi, Kenya. She was educated at Loreto Convent Msongari (1978–1989). She left Nairobi at age 16 for high school, studying at the United World College of the Atlantic, in Wales (I.B., 1991). Mutu moved to New York in the late 1990s, focusing on Fine Arts and Anthropology at The New School for Social Research, and Parsons School of Art and Design. She earned a BFA degree from Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Arts and Science in 1996 and a master\\'s degree in sculpture from Yale School of Art in 2000. \\nAs soon as Mutu graduated from Yale, her work began popping up in important shows--many of them international exhibitions and biennials. Importantly, Mutu was not able to see these shows; she had applied for her green card as soon as she had finished her studies, but was unable to leave the country while her application was pending. This was an extra long process for her, in the wake of 9/11--she was effectively stuck in the United States for 12 years. Mutu\\'s experiences of migration and its effects on her diasporic identity infuse her work with an expansive philosophy of belonging. \\nIn an email interview with NPR, Mutu wrote, \"Making art and traveling are my greatest teachers. Everyone should travel, not just to see new things but to see new things in themselves.\" In 2015, the artist made the decision to begin dividing her time between her studios in New York and Nairobi. These travels back and forth, she says, help give her valuable perspective: New York has \"an addictive potency,\" and its density of creative, entrepreneurial people inspires her greatly; Nairobi is \"layered, lush, and encourages a coexistence between humans and the natural world,\" and Mutu describes Kenya as a very attractive country, despite its \"anglophone trauma.\" \\n”It’s the difference between a plant with one root and one with a network of roots. If a plant has just one root, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to stand straight and strong. The idea of having many roots, of having your feet really grounded in different places, is extremely empowering for me.\"\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\n\\nMutu\\'s work crosses a variety of mediums, including collage, bricolage, video, performance, and sculpture, and investigates themes of gender, race, and colonialism. These mediums, many of which involve the mixing of materials, sources, and imagery, are more than just formal choices--they hint towards foundational themes of resilience and regeneration that appears throughout her oeuvre.\\nMutu\\'s work, in part, centers on the violence and misrepresentation experienced by Black women in contemporary society. A recurring theme of Mutu\\'s work is her various depictions of femininity. Mutu uses the feminine subject in her art, even when the figures are more or less unrecognizable, whether by using the form itself or the texture and patterns the figure is made from. Sometimes she uses cliche images of archetypal women--mothers, virgins, goddesses--as source material, reconfiguring them to create potent, charged images that reflect her own emotional agency, as well as the agency, multitudes, and contradictions of womanhood in general. Her use of otherworldly depictions for women, many times shown in a seemingly sexual or sensual pose, brings about discussion of the objectification of women. Specifically, Mutu addresses the hyper-objectification of black female bodies and has used an otherworldly nature to reiterate the fictitious nature of society\\'s depictions of black women. Mutu uses female subjectivity to examine other social and political issues as well; however, her aim is to always retain focus on female figures, identities, and experiences, in order to bring them to the forefront. \\nWhether through delicate lined patterns or familiar feminine builds, Mutu\\'s various ways of representing feminine qualities is said to enhance the strength of the images or the significance of the issues presented. Many of Mutu\\'s artworks are known to be interpreted in contradictory ways, both seen as complicit to problematic society and as hopeful for future change in society. It\\'s also been said that Mutu\\'s use of such intentionally repulsive or otherworldly imagery may help women to step away from society\\'s ideas of perfection and instead embrace their own imperfections and become more accepting of the flaws of others as well. Although her imagery of female figures has often been described as \"grotesque\", she claims they are instead \"disabled\", displaying a manifestation of historical and societal tensions present in black women\\'s identities. In these mangled forms, the struggle of women forced to comply with social expectations and historical oppressions is given physical form, portraying distinct inner turmoil.\\nMuch of this is accomplished through her use of mixed media, which allows for her to unmake and reimagine bodies through modes of collage. In her Sentinel series which has been active from 2016 until now, she creates regal and fierce abstract female forms made from clay, wood and various found materials.\\nIn an interview with the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia curator, Rachel Kent, she states, \"I try to stretch my own ideas about appropriate ways to depict women. Criticism, curiosity, and voyeurism lead me along, as I look at things I find hard to view – things that are sometimes distasteful or unethical\". Mutu frequently uses \"grotesque\" textures in her artwork and has cited her mother\\'s medical books on tropical diseases as an inspiration, stating that there is \"nothing more insanely visually interesting and repulsive than a body infected with tropical disease; these are diseases that grow and fester and become larger than the being that they have infected, almost.\"\\nMutu is able to enact personal and cultural transfigurations by transitioning from painting to sculpture and back again. Mutu says \" This transition was so powerful because I used my mind as an object maker  – I think I always painted like a sculptor.\" In Mutu\\'s collage work she began to respond to Western advertisement and beauty standards:  \"I began an ongoing critique and an intellectual an actual vandalization of those images, which were violating me by rendering me invisible.\"\\nThe themes and narratives of Mutu\\'s work create a visual representation of certain social, political, and physical realities of the world today. This includes issues of feminism, racism, the environment, and the effects of colonialism and rebuilding post-colonialism. Mutu\\'s visual arts deliberately reject colonial political and social constructs regarding these issues, instead deliberately examining them through the lens of the identities of black women. As a result, she is able to generate unique perspectives by under-represented identities, thus broadening and improving discourse surrounding certain issues, while also recognizing and emphasizing the importance of these women and their experiences.\\nIn her art, Mutu presents complex narratives of mental anguish and, in many ways, crises of identity. Her material transformations of the human body imply a theoretical layer, where psychological aspects of African experience can be represented. Mutu views her own art as a form of self-reflection, and as a way to process her own identity being boiled down to \"black\" as an African woman in America. Furthermore, she uses her art as a way to examine how African identities and experiences on the whole are oversimplified in western discourse, bringing the reality of the intricacies of feminism and colonialism to the forefront through the aesthetics of collage, mixed media art, and Afrofuturism.\\n\\n\\n== Influence of Afrofuturism and Africanfuturism ==\\nMutu\\'s work has been called \"firmly Africanfuturist and Afrofuturist\", as exemplified in her work, including one of her pieces titled The End of Eating Everything (2013). In her 2013–2014 installation at the Brooklyn Museum, the curatorial placard accompanying her work A\\'gave described Afrofuturism as \"an aesthetic that uses the imaginative strategies of science fiction to envision alternate realities for Africa and people of African descent\". For critics, Mutu\\'s imagined alternate realities for Africa through the medium of science fiction definitively situated Mutu in the genre of Afrofuturism.\\nSpecific elements of Mutu\\'s art that situate her within this genre include her amalgamations of humans and machines, or cyborgs, within collages such as Family Tree as well as the film The End of Eating Everything. \\nAdditionally, Mutu\\'s work consistently involves intentional re-imaginations of the African experience. In Misguided Little Unforgivable Hierarchies, she examines social hierarchy and power relationships through the medium of collage, for \"rankings of peoples have historically been constructed around fabricated racial and ethnic categories\".  In Family Tree, as in many of her works, Mutu deliberately constructs both a past and a future within the single figure through displaying diagrams from antique medical journals as well as mechanical images. Mutu uses Afrofuturism to explore themes of alienation, which relates to feminism, colonialism, materiality, and disability. In this way, Afrofuturism acts as a lens for these subjects. The use of Afrofuturistic aesthetics also allows for creative freedom in rendering bodies and representations of identities and experiences, as can be seen with the presence of cyborgs and alien-like figures in her works.\\nThe presence of black women in a futuristic setting also acts as a pushback to ideas of evolutionism and cultural and social hierarchies. By contextualizing these women in such extreme modern spaces, Mutu makes a statement -- that women of color are included in the idea of the idealistic \"evolved\" human. This rejects colonialist ideas about people of color being \"less evolved\", or modernist ideas about people of color being stuck in a less developed state.\\nIn the goal of creating distinct representations of struggles and tensions for female and African identities, the principles and aesthetics of Afrofuturism work well with Mutu\\'s use of collage and mixed media art. These elements form a more holistic approach to examining fractured identities.\\n\\n\\n== Female Representations ==\\nAspects of feminine themes are used across Mutu\\'s body of work. The majority of her artwork, whether in her collages, sculptures, photography, or performances; all of these highlights a female character.\\nA handful of Mutu\\'s works highlight the female figure and feminine features. Using references to a black woman\\'s body, Mutu uses the silhouette or actual photographic imagery of a woman to create the characters in her works. A series of artworks that reflect the use of the female silhouette and elements of photographic images of black females is “The Ark Collection” from 2006. One of the artworks in this collection, titled “Highland Woman, shows a photographic image of a female body meshed with various college elements, helping create a scene as well as create the rest of the silhouette of a female figure, highlighting the photographic elements of a woman\\'s nude breasts. The rest of these works have been discussed as using the female form to create “figurations of black women’s corporeality in visual culture”. She also places a lot of emphasis on body language and the way the woman is situated within the work. \\nAnother feminine aspect that Mutu draws from, is the idea of feminine power. She draws these ideas in her “The Seated series.” In an interview, Mutu claimed this artwork is inspired by “caryatids throughout history,” in which she uses a reference from women of color. Mutu shares that “in Greek architecture, you see these women in their beautiful robes, and then in African sculpture across the continent, you see these women wither kneeling or sitting, sometimes holding a child, as well as holding up the seat of the king.” Most African women in these historical sculptures show women of color in these contexts implemented on the bottom on the pedestal. She wanted to showcase the African American women as being on top of a pedestal to express a reclaim of black female power. She considers the black female experience in her pieces through her inspiration from female forms that showcase power in art history. \\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover\\'s Requiem (2006) ===\\nMutu has exhibited sculptural installations. In 2006, Mutu and British architect David Adjaye collaborated on a project. They transformed the Upper East Side Salon 94 townhouse in New York into a subterranean dinner-party setting entitled Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover\\'s Requiem. Furs and bullet holes adorned the walls while wine bottles dangled in a careless chandelier-like form above the stained table. The table\\'s multiple legs resembled thick femurs with visibly delicate tibias, and the whole space had a pungent aroma. The artists strove to show a moment of gluttony as she stated, \"I wanted to create a feast, a communing of minds and viewers Something has gone wrong, there is a tragedy or unfolding of evil\". This vicious hunger was seen as a connection between images of The Last Supper, the climate of the current art-buying world, and the war in Iraq.\\n\\n\\n=== Cleaning Earth (2006) ===\\nIt is a performance video in which a woman uses a panga [a type of machete] to chop up a log but the wood is impossible to sever. The action serves to emphasize Africa\\'s history of being cut up into portions by colonial forces. The work was shot in a town in Presidio, Texas, a town with racial tension and violence since it sits on the U.S./Mexican border, uprooting energy from the site\\n\\n\\n=== Suspended Playtime (2008) ===\\nAnother installation of Mutu, Suspended Playtime (2008) is a series of bundles of garbage bags, wrapped in gold twine as if suspended in spiders\\' webs, all suspended from the ceiling over the viewer. The installation makes reference to the common use of garbage bags as improvised balls and other playthings by African children.\\n\\n\\n=== Stone Ihiga (2009) ===\\nPart of the Performa Commissions for the Performa Biennial, Stone Ihiga is a performance art piece created by Mutu in collaboration with Imani Uzuri.\\n\\n\\n=== Sketchbook Drawing (2011–12) ===\\nAs a visual artist, Mutu takes inspiration from fashion and travel magazines, pornography, ethnography, and mechanics. In 2013, at the Nasher Museum of Art, Mutu showed her sketchbook drawings for the first time ever in her retrospective exhibition, Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey. The books consisted of strangely attractive, yet grotesque human figures fused with animals, plants, or machines.\\n\\n\\n=== The End of Eating Everything (2013) ===\\nIn 2013, Wangechi Mutu\\'s first-ever animated video, The End of Eating Everything, was created in collaboration with recording artist Santigold, commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art. The video was animated by Awesome + Modest.\\n\\n\\n=== Nguva na Nyoka (2014) ===\\nIn 2014, Mutu\\'s art was on display at an exhibition entitled Nguva na Nyoka, at Victoria Miro Gallery in London. At the exhibition\\'s opening night, Mutu displayed a performance piece, wherein guests were encouraged to consume custom-made Wangechi Mutu chocolate mermaids. The guests could obtain a mermaid only by \"snapping a photo of their first bite, lick, taste\", operating as a commentary on \"the public consumption of brown bodies\".\\n\\n\\n=== The Seated series (2019) ===\\nIn 2019, Mutu created bronze statues (titled The Seated I, The Seated II, The Seated IV) for the exterior niches of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The statues seated women were displayed from September 9, 2019 through January 12, 2020.\\n\\n\\n=== MamaRay (2020) ===\\nIn 2020 Mutu completed her large bronze sculpture, MamaRay, commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nMutu\\'s first solo exhibition at a major North American museum opened at the Art Gallery of Ontario in March 2010. On 21 March 2013, she held her first United States solo exhibition, Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey at Nasher Museum of Art. The exhibition Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey subsequently traveled to the Brooklyn Museum\\'s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art in October 2013.\\nIn 2014 Mutu founded the charitable organization Africa\\'s Out! located in Brooklyn New York. The organization is devoted to supporting artists whose work subverts traditional narratives around Africa and its diaspora.\\nIn 2016, her film The End of Carrying All was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas. The film depicts Mutu crossing a landscape with a basket filling up with consumer goods as the landscape changes, ending with a volcanic eruption. In 2016, she also participated in several group exhibits, including \"Blackness in Abstraction,\" at the Pace Gallery in New York, \"Black Pulp!\" at the International Print Center in New York, and \"Africans in America\" at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg.\\nIn 2017, her black bronze sculpture Water Woman, of which depicted a nguva, was placed at the foot of the amphitheater at the Contemporary Austins fourteen-acre sculpture park at Laguna Gloria. Based on the East African folklore of the half woman and half sea creature is a representation of histories narrative of women as cunning temptresses. The exhibition ran from September 23, 2017, to January 14, 2018, when it became a part of the museum\\'s permanent collection.\\nIn September 2019, four female bronze sculptures by Mutu, \"Seated I, II, III, and IV\", were placed to occupy the empty niches always intended to house free-standing sculpture in the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the first instillation and exhibition (\"The New Ones Will Free Us\" September 9 – Fall 2020) of what will be an annual commission meant to feature work by contemporary artists. Mutu has described the bronze statues as having been inspired by caryatids. Initially, the sculptures were planned to be displayed until January 12, 2020, but their exhibition was extended to June 8, 2020, and further extended to Fall 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Seated I\" and \"Seated III\" were subsequently acquired for The Met\\'s permanent collection. A discussion with her about the exhibit and contemporary times was recorded on July 28, 2020 for a series entitled Women and the Critical Eye.\\nIn January 2020, Mutu was part of Artpace\\'s exhibit entitled Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace. Curated by Erin K. Murphy, Visibilities not only kicks off Artpace\\'s 25th anniversary celebration, but also highlights past artists from their International Artist-in-Residency program, such as Mutu who was a resident there in Fall of 2004. Mutu\\'s 12-panel series Histology of the Different Classes of Uterine Tumors, made up of collaged digital prints, was exhibited in the Hudson Showroom.\\nIn 2023 the New Museum featured a retrospective of Mutu\\'s work. The solo exhibition entitled Mutu: Intertwined, features roughly 115 pieces ranging from early in her career to brand new pieces showcasing various mediums and techniques including sculpture, video, collage, and more. Wangechi Mutu\\'s work was included in the Spirit in the Land exhibition and accompanying publication at the Nasher Museum of Art, in 2023, which later traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\nMutu\\'s artistic oeuvre also embraces film and video installations as media, and the artist has produced a number of films such as Amazing Grace (2005) in the collections of Pérez Art Museum Miami, Eat Cake (2012), The End of eating Everything (2013), and My Cave Call (2021).\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHer work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art; The Studio Museum in Harlem; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Pérez Art Museum Miami, the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University;  the Brooklyn Museum; Tate Modern in London.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nAdrienne Edwards, Courtney J.

              "  'Sarah Sze (; born 1969) is an American artist and professor of visual arts at Columbia University. Sze\\'s work explores the role of technology, information, and memory with objects in contemporary life utilizing everyday materials. Her work often represents objects caught in suspension. Drawing from Modernist traditions, Sze confronts the relationship between low-value mass-produced objects in high-value institutions, creating the sense that everyday life objects can be art. She has exhibited internationally and her works are in the collections of several major museums. \\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nSze was born in Boston in 1969. Her father, Chia-Ming Sze, was an architect who moved to the United States from Shanghai at age four and her mother, Judy Mossman, was an Anglo-Scottish-Irish schoolteacher. Sze reports that as a child she would draw constantly. She attended Milton Academy as a day student and graduated summa cum laude with a BA in Architecture and Painting from Yale University in 1991.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nSze\\'s work has been featured in The Whitney Biennial (2000), the Carnegie International (1999) and several international biennials, including Berlin (1998), Guangzhou (2015), Liverpool (2008), Lyon (2009), São Paulo (2002), and Venice (1999, 2013, and 2015).\\nSze has created public artworks for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Walker Art Center, and the High Line in New York.\\nSze is a 2003 MacArthur Fellow and was granted a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Biennial Competition Award in 1999.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nIn 2013, Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale with an exhibition called Triple Point. \\nOn January 1, 2017, a permanent installation commissioned by MTA Arts & Design of drawings by Sze on ceramic tiles opened in the 96th Street subway station on the new Second Avenue Subway line in New York City.\\nIn 2020, Sze unveiled Shorter than the Day, a permanent installation, in LaGuardia Airport\\nIn 2021, Sze unveiled her most recent permanent installation, Fallen Sky, at Storm King Art Center, Cornwall, New York.\\nFor her 2023 exhibition called Timelapse at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, Sze created a series of site-specific installations through the Frank Lloyd Wright building.\\nIn 2023, Sze transformed a large Victorian waiting room at Peckham Rye Station in London into an immersive installation called The Waiting Room.\\nIn 2023, Sze was featured in Art21\\'s New York Closeup Series.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nSze has one brother, the venture capitalist David Sze. Sze lives in New York City with her husband Siddhartha Mukherjee and their two daughters. Sze’s great-grandfather, Alfred Sao-ke Sze, was the first Chinese student to go to Cornell University. He was China’s minister to Britain and later ambassador to the United States. Her grandfather is Szeming Sze who was the initiator of World Health Organization.\\n\\n\\n== Process ==\\nSze draws from Modernist traditions of the found objects, to build large-scale installations. She uses everyday items like string, Q-tips, photographs, and wire to create complex compositions resembling constellations. This composition gives her work a chaotic yet precise style with the overlap of materials. All objects, regardless of size, are related to one another. This creates a larger meaning in her work as all of the pieces come together to convey a message. By Sze remolding and reshaping these everyday objects, she additionally changes the value of these materials. The incorporation of these \"low value\" objects rejects the traditional standard that sculptures have to be solid, limited in geometric shapes, and work with specific materials. This can be displayed with Sze\\'s intentional inclusion of the unseen process materials (ladders, clips, wooden poles, etc.) being included in her final work. \\nSze throughout her career has pushed the boundaries with sculpture. This can be seen in her using her works to convey movement. Through precise planning and strategic considerations, Sze strives to make the inanimate look animate. Using influences from her formal training in painting and architecture, Sze looks into what one can do with a sculpture that is limited to the two-dimensional.The effect of this is to \"challenge the very material of sculpture, the very constitution of sculpture, as a solid form that has to do with finite geometric constitutions, shapes, and content.\" \\nSze additionally takes into consideration the viewer\\'s interaction with her works and the objects she has chosen to display. When selecting materials, Sze focuses on the exploration of value acquisition–what value the object holds and how it is acquired. In an interview with curator Okwui Enwezor, Sze explained that during her conceptualization process, she will \"choreograph the experience to create an ebb and flow of information [...] thinking about how people approach, slow down, stop, perceive [her art].\"\\n\\n\\n== Significance ==\\nSze\\'s work encapsulates how an individual perceives everyday life and their environment. The recording of objects with memory is one of the ways Sze represents this idea. In her works like Timekeeper, Sze Creates a time capsule, allowing her to directly connect with the objects she utilized with the piece to the year. With Sze reconstructing former works, she has the record of what she originally used but now can add new materials, creating an entirely new time capsule. Time itself is a strong theme Sze plays into with the concept of the multiplicity of the unknown. This is created by her works veering off the canvas in multiple directions leads to this theme of the plurality of the unknown. Time and memory in Sze\\'s work can also be seen with the distortion of images throughout time. Sze in her print installations has referenced prior works, relying on memory to reconstruct the former work in her current project. This not only reflects her prior work but also highlights how objects change over time in memory. Sze goes into additional detail about pictures and how this method can be used to retain a sculpture. Sze choice of materials is one of the key factors when taking in her works. The inclusion of these mass-produced objects additionally alludes to domestic life and the feeling of overabundance and growth. Having these daily objects collected, layered, or stacked on one another can be seen in her conveying an overwhelming or cramped space.\\nBy working with sculpture, Sze is conscious of the space not only her work is located but also the space her works create. Sze\\'s spherical work creates the opportunity for viewers to walk inside the work, creating an immersive experience. This choice is made whether or not the audience is aware when they enter the work they are part of the work or not. With Sze\\'s background and upbringing in architecture, she is methodical in how visitors will encounter her work and how a gallery space will shape and form her work. This consideration deepens Sze\\'s contemplation of whether there is a history to tell with the architecture or if it is there to guide the audience. The space Sze creates in her works reflects her choice of objects, creating a relationship with her work and the location where they intertwine. Within the space Sze creates especially with her suspending installation works, there is a feeling with these works of fragility to them. Yet through the deliberate process of aligning every object to one another, there is a strategic method to its fragile look.\\nWith works located in the natural environment, Sze also takes into consideration the context where her work will reside. This can be seen in what she wants her works to not only convey but be of value. With her Storm King Art Center permanent commission, Fallen Sky creates the infusion and disintegration of the extra-terrestrial material to become one with the ground.Other outside installations like Still Life with Landscape take into consideration the natural habitat and include those needs with the structure, creating a seamless interconnection with the composition of the work.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSze has staged a large number of solo exhibitions and shows across the United States and internationally. Her notable solo exhibitions include White Room (1997), White Columns, New York; Sarah Sze (1999), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Sarah Sze: The Triple Point of Water (2003-2004), originating at the Whitney Museum, New York; Triple Point (2013), American pavilion, 55th Venice Biennale; and Sarah Sze: Timelapse (2023), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.\\nSze has also participated in a wide array of group exhibitions, including the Berlin Biennale (1998); 48th and 56th Venice Biennale (1999, 2015); Whitney Biennial (2000); and Liverpool Biennial (2008).\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards and grants ==\\n\\n2022 - Asia Arts Game Change Award\\n2020 - Inductee, American Academy of Arts and Sciences\\n2018 – The American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York\\n2013 – US Representative for the Venice Biennale\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nEnwezor, Okwui; Benjamin H.

              "  'Vito Acconci (Italian: [ˈviːto akˈkontʃi], ; January 24, 1940 – April 27, 2017) was an American performance, video and installation artist, whose diverse practice eventually included sculpture, architectural design, and landscape design. His performance and video art was characterized by \"existential unease,\" exhibitionism, discomfort, transgression and provocation, as well as wit and audacity, and often involved crossing boundaries such as public–private, consensual–nonconsensual, and real world–art world. His work is considered to have influenced artists including Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley, Bruce Nauman, and Tracey Emin, among others.  \\nAcconci was initially interested in radical poetry, creating 0 to 9 Magazine, but by the late 1960s he began creating Situationist-influenced performances in the street or for small audiences that explored the body and public space. Two of his most famous pieces were Following Piece (1969), in which he selected random passersby on New York City streets and followed them for as long as he was able, and Seedbed (1972), in which he claimed that he masturbated while under a temporary floor at the Sonnabend Gallery, as visitors walked above and heard him speaking.\\nIn the late-1970s, he turned to sculpture, architecture and design, greatly increasing the scale of his work, if not his art world profile. Over the next two decades he developed public artworks and parks, airport rest areas, artificial islands and other architectural projects that frequently embraced participation, change and playfulness. Notable works of this period include: Personal Island, designed for Zwolle, the Netherlands (1994); Walkways Through the Wall at the Wisconsin Center, in Milwaukee, WI (1998); and Murinsel, for Graz, Austria (2003). Retrospectives of Acconci\\'s work have been organized by the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1978) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1980), and his work is in numerous public collections, including those of the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum of American Art. He has been recognized with fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1976, 1980, 1983, 1993), John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1979), and American Academy in Rome (1986). In addition to his art and design work, Acconci taught at many higher learning institutions. Acconci died on April 28, 2017, in Manhattan at age 77.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\nBorn Vito Hannibal Acconci in the Bronx, New York in 1940, Acconci attended a Roman Catholic elementary school, high school (Regis High School in New York City), and college. He received a BA in literature from the College of the Holy Cross in 1962 and an MFA in literature and poetry from the University of Iowa.  He noted: \"There wasn\\'t a woman in my classroom between kindergarten and graduate school.\" Then he returned to New York City to pursue a career as a poet.\\n\\n\\n=== 1960s and 70s ===\\nAcconci began his career as a poet, editing and self-publishing the poetry magazine 0 TO 9 with Bernadette Mayer in the late 1960s. Produced in quantities of 100 to 350 copies per issue on a mimeograph machine, the magazine mixed contributions by both poets and artists.\\nIn the late 1960s, Acconci transformed himself into a performance and video artist using his own body as a subject for photography, film, video, and performance. Most of his early work incorporated subversive social comment. His performance and video work was marked heavily by confrontation and Situationism. In the mid-1970s, Acconci expanded his métier into the world of audio/visual installations.\\nOne installation/performance work from this period, perhaps his best known work,  is Seedbed (January 15–29, 1972). In Seedbed Acconci lay hidden underneath a gallery-wide ramp installed at the Sonnabend Gallery, masturbating while vocalizing into a loudspeaker his fantasies about the visitors walking above him on the ramp.  One motivation behind Seedbed was to involve the public in the work\\'s production by creating a situation of reciprocal interchange between artist and viewer.\\nCindy Nemser was the first art critic to write about Acconci for Arts Magazine in 1971. Nemser also later did an interview with Acconci which became the cover piece for Arts Magazine.\\nIn the article \"Video: the Aesthetics of Narcissism,\" Rosalind Krauss refers to aspects of Narcissism apparent in the video work of Acconci. \"A line of sight begin Acconci\\'s plane of vision ends on the eyes of his projected double.\" Krauss uses this description to underline aspects of narcissism in the Vito Acconci work Centers. In the piece Acconci is filming himself pointing directly at himself for about 25 minutes; by doing so Acconci makes a nonsensical gesture that exemplifies the critical aspects of a work of art through the beginning of the 20th century. Krauss also goes on to explain the psychological basis behind the actions of video in comparison to discussions of object art.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nIn the 1980s, Acconci turned to permanent sculptures and installations. During this time he invited viewers to create artwork by activating machinery that erected shelters and signs. One of the most prominent examples of these temporary installations is titled Instant House, which was first created in 1980, but was recently exhibited in the summer of 2012 at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. Later, in January 1983, Acconci was a visiting artist at Middlebury College. During that time, he completed Way Station I (Study Chamber), which was his first permanent installation. The work sparked immense controversy on the college\\'s campus, and was eventually set on fire and destroyed in 1985. Despite this, the sculpture marked a transition for Acconci\\'s career from performance artist to architectural designer. He turned to the creation of furniture and prototypes of houses and gardens in the late 1980s, and in 1988, the artist founded Acconci Studio, which focused on theoretical design and building. Acconci Studio is located on Jay Street in Brooklyn. Acconci designed the United Bamboo store in Tokyo in 2003, and collaborated on concept designs for interactive art vehicle Mister Artsee in 2006, among others including the highly acclaimed:  Murinsel in Graz, Austria.\\n\\nThe artist has focused on architecture and landscape design that integrates public and private space. One example of this is Walkways Through the Wall, which flow through structural boundaries of the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and provide seating at both ends. An example of this interest on the private/public space is the collaboration he did with architect Steven Holl when commissioned on a collaborative building project for Storefront for Art and Architecture. The project replaced the existing facade with a series of twelve panels that pivot vertically or horizontally to open the entire length of the gallery directly onto the street. The project blurs the boundary between interior and exterior and, by placing the panels in different configurations, creates a multitude of different possible facades, and is now regarded as a contemporary architectural landmark. Another example of his work is Dirt Wall (1992) at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities Sculpture Garden in Colorado. The wall begins outside the Arvada Center and extends inside, rising from ground level to a height of 24 feet. The glass and steel wall contains a mixture of volcanic rock, various types of sand, red dolomite, and topsoil which are visible through the glass panels, and represents an attempt to bring what is underground up, and what is outside in.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nOne of his later works, Lobby-for-the-Time-Being is an installation in the North Wing Lobby of Bronx Museum of the Arts. It has been there since 2009. The installation fills the lobby with a web of white Corian, creating a long, undulating wall resembling giant paper snowflakes.\\nIn 2008, in an interview with Brian Sherwin for Myartspace, Vito discussed Seedbed at length. Vito discussed the title Seedbed and the connection it had to the performance, stating, \"I knew what my goal had to be: I had to produce seed, the space I was in should become a bed of seed, a field of seed – in order to produce seed, I had to masturbate – in order to masturbate, I had to excite myself.\"\\nIn 2010, Acconci completed Waterfall Out & In, a water feature at the visitors\\' center of the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Part of the piece is indoors and part of the piece is outdoors.\\nIn 2013, Acconci\\'s Way Station I (Study Chamber), a work that was vandalized and destroyed in 1985 after being constructed for Middlebury College, was reinstalled along with an exhibit at the college\\'s museum.\\nIn 2014, Acconci was featured in a video segment, produced by Marc Santo, in which he talks about a few of his favorite projects that were never completed, including a Skate Park in San Jose and a museum of needles in Ichihara, Japan. \"I think what unbuildable stuff leads to is maybe a possible reexamination, not so much of the past, but of what\\'s to come,\" he said in the interview.\\n\\n\\n== Academic career ==\\nAcconci taught at many institutions, including the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax; San Francisco Art Institute; California Institute of the Arts, Valencia; Cooper Union; School of the Art Institute of Chicago; Yale University; University of Iowa,  Pratt Institute; and the Parsons School of Design. Prior to his death, he had most recently taught at Brooklyn College in the Art Department and Performance and Interactive Media Arts programs and was an Adjunct Associate Professor at Pratt Institute in the Graduate Architecture and Urban Design Department.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and death ==\\nAcconci had been married to the artist Rosemary Mayer in the 1960s. Acconci died on April 28, 2017. He was 77. His cause of death has not been released by his estate. He is survived by his wife, Maria Acconci.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\"Vienna For Art\\'s Sake !

              "  'Larry Bell (born 1939) is an American contemporary artist and sculptor. He is best known for his glass boxes and large-scaled illusionistic sculptures. He is a grant recipient from, among others, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, and his artworks are found in the collections of many major cultural institutions. He lives and works in Taos, New Mexico, and maintains a studio in Venice, California.\\n\\n\\n== Critical analysis of work ==\\nBell\\'s art addresses the relationship between the art object and its environment through the sculptural and reflective properties of his work. Bell is often associated with Light and Space, a group of mostly West Coast artists whose work is primarily concerned with perceptual experience stemming from the viewer\\'s interaction with their work. This group also includes, among others, artists James Turrell, John McCracken, Peter Alexander, Robert Irwin and Craig Kauffman. On the occasion of the  Tate Gallery\\'s exhibit Three Artists from Los Angeles: Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Doug Wheeler, Michael Compton wrote the following to describe the effect of Bell\\'s artwork:\\n\\nAt various times and particularly in the 1960s some artists have worked near what could be called the upper limits of perceptions, that is, where the eye is on the point of being overwhelmed by a superabundance of stimulation and is in danger of losing its power to control it... These artists sometimes produce the effect that the threat to our power to resolve what is seen heightens our awareness of the process of seeing...However, the three artists in this show... operate in various ways near the lowest thresholds of visual discrimination. The effect of this is again to cause one to make a considerable effort to discern and so to become conscious of the process of seeing.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois in 1939 and grew up in Los Angeles, California. From 1957 to 1959, he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now part of CalArts) in Los Angeles, with the intention of becoming a Disney animator. He was a student of artists Robert Irwin, Richards Ruben, Robert Chuey, and Emerson Woelffer, and it was at Chouinard where Bell explored abstract painting.\\nHe followed friends like Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ken Price, and Craig Kauffman to the beach. \"He was the first and youngest person to crash the art scene of that era\", says Edward Ruscha. He found representation at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, together with Edward Ruscha, Ed Moses, Billy Al Bengston.\\n\\n\\n== 1960s ==\\n\\nBell\\'s earliest pieces are paintings in the Abstract Expressionist tradition. He began incorporating fragments and shards of clear and mirrored glass into his compositions. At the same time, he began in his painting to produce angular geometric compositions that alluded to or represented three-dimensional forms. These works frequently depicted rectilinear forms with truncated corners. Next there came a series of shadow boxes or “ghost boxes”, three-dimensional cases whose surfaces often featured shapes reminiscent of those in the preceding paintings. Of this transition, critic Peter Frank has observed:\\n\\nThe earliest boxes contained within them, coated onto the glass or even defining their parameters, the angled contours and beveled edges with which the paintings had inferred three-dimensionality; the illusion of volume was thus conflated with actual volume.\\nFrom the shadow box pieces, Bell moved on to begin what is perhaps his most recognizable body of work, namely cube sculptures that rest on transparent pedestals. Bell first started constructing these pieces in the early ‘60s. The earliest examples frequently featured \"the systematic use of modular internal divisions (ellipses, parallelograms, checker and hexagonal arrangements)\", and used a variety of materials including formica, brass, and wood. Three of these works were included in the seminal 1966 exhibit, \"Primary Structures\" at the Jewish Museum in New York.\\n\\n\"Hewn from remaindered bits of glass salvaged at the Burbank frame shop where he worked while studying at Chouinard, Bell\\'s sculptures set the artist apart from his contemporaries. After the Sidney Janis Gallery sold one of his early cubes to Buffalo\\'s Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Pace Gallery in New York offered him a solo show, along with representation, as did Ileana Sonnabend, then based in Paris,\" according to Michael Slenske.\\nBell\\'s surfaces work both as mirrors and windows, sometimes simultaneously. In viewing the cubes, their suspension at torso height on clear pedestals designed by Bell allows the viewer to look up through them from underneath, as well as perceiving them from all four sides and from above. Bell\\'s sculptures have the effect of reading as self-contained objects while simultaneously drawing in their surroundings and proactively changing their environment. For these reasons, the sculptures’ effects depend heavily on their lighting and setting.\\nBell has explored the opportunities afforded by thin film deposition along other avenues. He began creating large, freestanding glass walls that can be arranged in an infinite number of configurations. These larger installations feature panes that extend from the floor or that reach above eye level. In 1968 Bell made the following comments on the perceptual and environmental aspects of this body of work, and on the leap from the cubes to the larger configurations:\\n\\nThe space declared by these new sculptures becomes the work. ...When the pieces get to the kind of scale I am employing then the scale of the material begins to overwhelm the spectator. This creates the sense of a partial environment. So to extend the format may prove to be interesting. Then the observer could walk around and into the unit and at the same time, see through it. Obviously, it will then do totally different things to the observer and the spatial experience will be very dimensional, especially given the ephemeral nature of the material. At the moment my work tends to be frontal and two-sided. This doesn\\'t really worry me, but I would like them to work from all four sides. The beauty of the box format is that it has no dictated top, sides, or bottom—they are interchangeable—and I would like to get some of the same quality into these new works. Obviously, I have to forego a top or bottom.\\nBell appeared on the cover (in a photo cutout by his friend Dennis Hopper) of Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the iconic 1967 Beatles’ album. He appears in the third row. To date, he is one of five surviving persons whose photos are depicted on that cover.\\nIn 1969, Bell received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fine arts.\\n\\n\\n== 1970s and 1980s ==\\n\\nHis inclusion in the Tate Gallery\\'s \"Three Artists from Los Angeles\" exhibition in London in 1970 (alongside Irwin and Doug Wheeler,) further cemented Bell\\'s stature as one of the era\\'s preeminent practitioners—on the West Coast and beyond.\\nTwo large bodies of work on paper, Bell\\'s \"vapor drawings\" and the more recent \"mirage works\", are also the products of Bell\\'s use of thin film deposition technology. The vapor drawings are created by using PET film to mask paper sheets, which are then coated. ELIN 71, from 1982, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of these vapor drawings. \"ELIN\", which stands for \"ellipse insert\", is one of several series of Bell\\'s vapor drawings. Bell describes the advantages of this process and medium:\\n\\nMasking the paper with thin PET film strips to expose areas related to the shape of the page plane enabled me to generate images spontaneously. This work gave me a conscious glimpse of the inherent power of spontaneity and improvisation. The work happened intuitively...In a short amount of time I created a number of interesting pieces. I liked this way of working. It was different from tediously coping with the weight and risk of glass. In my mind, I was investigating improbable visuals using improbable means.\\nThe mirage pieces, on the other hand, are collages constructed out of pieces of coated materials that are then arranged and laminated. As Bell says, \"I colored sheets of various paper materials, strips of PET film, and laminate film. Then I fused them to canvases and stretched them. Tapestries of woven light differentials resulted.\"\\n\\n\\n== 1990s ==\\nBell was the recipient of the 1990 New Mexico Governor\\'s Awards for Excellence in the Arts.\\nIn the early 1990s, Bell was using a computerized sketch program to create images of stick figures. He showed these drawings to architect Frank Gehry while the two were collaborating on proposals for a home commissioned by arts patron and insurance executive Peter B. Lewis. Gehry\\'s enthusiasm for the sketches encouraged Bell to develop the concept further. The project eventually led to Bell\\'s creation of a concept narrative for the figures based on a fictionalized mythology of the early (pre-Babylonian) civilization of Sumer. Bell developed three-dimensional models from a wide variety of materials, and Lewis eventually commissioned two of the figures to be fabricated from bronze, a material developed in Sumer. This body of work was the subject of a 1995 exhibit at the Harwood Museum in Taos, New Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== 2000s ==\\n\\nBell continues his work with the cube to this day; more recent ones are made only of glass and have beveled edges, as opposed to plates that sit within a metal frame. The glass is typically covered with a film that has been treated using a technique called thin film deposition of metallic particles. This process takes place in a vacuum chamber, and involves vaporizing metal alloys that then settle on the glass surface.

              "  'Robert Goodnough (October 23, 1917 – October 2, 2010) was an American abstract expressionist painter. A veteran of World War II, Goodnough was one of the last of the original generation of the New York School; (although he has been referred to as a member of the \"second generation\" of Abstract Expressionists), even though he began exhibiting his work in galleries in New York City in the early 1950s. Robert Goodnough was among the 24 artists from the total of 256 participants who were included in the famous 9th Street Art Exhibition, (1951) and in all the following New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals from 1953 to 1957. These Annuals were important because the participants were chosen by the artists themselves. Early in his career starting in 1950 he showed his paintings at the Wittenborn Gallery, NYC. He had shown at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York City from 1952 to 1970  and again from 1984 to 1986. In 1960 and 1961 he had solo exhibitions at The Art Institute of Chicago. A veteran of scores of solo exhibitions and hundreds of group exhibitions in the United States and abroad, Goodnough also had solo exhibitions in 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. A major work by Goodnough is included in The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. In later years his paintings were also associated with the Color Field movement.\\nDuring the 1940s Goodnough graduated from Syracuse University and served in the U. S. Army during World War II. After the war in 1946 he attended the Ozenfant School of Fine Arts in New York and the Hans Hofmann summer school in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He earned his master\\'s degree from New York University in 1950 after which he began to exhibit his paintings publicly and also to write articles for ARTnews magazine.\\nIn 1992 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nMartin H.

              "  'Andy Warhol (; born Andrew Warhola Jr.; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American visual artist, film director and producer. A leading figure in the pop art movement, Warhol is considered one of the most important American artists of the second half of the 20th century. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best-known works include the silkscreen paintings Campbell\\'s Soup Cans (1962) and Marilyn Diptych (1962), the experimental films Empire (1964) and Chelsea Girls (1966), and the multimedia events known as the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966–67).\\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, Warhol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustrator in the 1950s. After exhibiting his work in art galleries, he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist in the 1960s. His New York studio, The Factory, became a well-known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals, drag queens, playwrights, Bohemian street people, Hollywood celebrities and wealthy patrons. He directed and produced several underground films starring a collection of personalities known as Warhol superstars, and is credited with inspiring the widely used expression \"15 minutes of fame.\" Warhol managed and produced the experimental rock band the Velvet Underground. He also founded Interview and authored numerous books, including The Philosophy of Andy Warhol and Popism: The Warhol Sixties.\\nIn June 1968, Warhol was almost killed by radical feminist Valerie Solanas, who shot him inside his studio. After gallbladder surgery, Warhol died of cardiac arrhythmia in February 1987 at the age of 58 in New York.\\nWarhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. The Andy Warhol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh, which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives, is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Warhol has been described as the \"bellwether of the art market\". Many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable. His works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold. In 2013, a 1963 serigraph titled Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) sold for $105 million. In 2022, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) sold for $195 million, which is the most expensive work of art sold at auction by an American artist.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and beginnings (1928–1949) ===\\n\\nWarhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew Warhola Sr.; 1889–1942) and Julia Warhola (née Zavacká, 1891–1972), whose first child was born in their homeland of Austria-Hungary and died before their move to the US.\\n\\nHis parents were working-class Lemko emigrants from Mikó, Austria-Hungary (now called Miková, located in today\\'s northeastern Slovakia). Warhol\\'s father emigrated to the United States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death of Warhol\\'s grandparents. Warhol\\'s father worked in a coal mine. The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The family was Ruthenian Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church. Warhol had two elder brothers—Pavol (Paul), the eldest, was born before the family emigrated; John was born in Pittsburgh. Pavol\\'s son, James Warhola, became a successful children\\'s book illustrator.\\nIn third grade, Warhol had Sydenham\\'s chorea (also known as St. Vitus\\' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation blotchiness. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew, listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences. When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident.\\nAs a teenager, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in 1945, and also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he studied commercial art. During his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Beaux Arts Society. He also served as art director of the student art magazine, Cano, illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full-page interior illustration in 1949. These are believed to be his first two published artworks. Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949. Later that year, he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.\\n\\n\\n=== 1950s ===\\nWarhol\\'s early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for Glamour magazine in 1949. In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller. While working in the shoe industry, Warhol developed his \"blotted line\" technique, applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme. American photographer John Coplans recalled that \"nobody drew shoes the way Andy did. He somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own, a sort of sly, Toulouse-Lautrec kind of sophistication, but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place. The kids in the apartment [which Andy shared in New York – note by Coplans] noticed that the vamps on Andy\\'s shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but [Israel] Miller didn\\'t mind. Miller loved them.\"\\nIn 1952, Alexander Iolas is credited as discovering Andy Warhol, and he organized first solo show at the Hugo Gallery in New York, and although that show was not well received, by 1956, he was included in his first group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1956, Warhol traveled around the world with his friend, production designer Charles Lisanby, studying art and culture in several countries. Warhol\\'s \"whimsical\" ink drawings of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest showings at the Bodley Gallery in New York in 1957.\\nWarhol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an epidiascope. Using prints by Edward Wallowitch, his \"first boyfriend\", the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during Warhol\\'s often cursory tracing of contours and hatching of shadows. Warhol used Wallowitch\\'s photograph Young Man Smoking a Cigarette (c.\\u20091956), for a 1958 design for a book cover he submitted to Simon and Schuster for the Walter Ross pulp novel The Immortal, and later used others for his series of paintings.\\nWith the rapid expansion of the record industry, RCA Records hired Warhol, along with another freelance artist, Sid Maurer, to design album covers and promotional materials.\\n\\n\\n=== 1960s ===\\n\\nWarhol was an early adopter of the silk screen printmaking process as a technique for making paintings. In 1961 Warhol purchased a townhouse at 1342 Lexington Avenue in Carnegie Hill, which he also used as his art studio. In 1962, Warhol was taught silk screen printmaking techniques by Max Arthur Cohn at his graphic arts business in Manhattan. In his book Popism: The Warhol Sixties, Warhol writes: \"When you do something exactly wrong, you always turn up something\".\\nIn May 1962, Warhol was featured in an article in Time with his painting Big Campbell\\'s Soup Can with Can Opener (Vegetable) (1962), which initiated his most sustained motif, the Campbell\\'s soup can. That painting became Warhol\\'s first to be shown in a museum when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford in July 1962. On July 9, 1962, Warhol\\'s exhibition opened at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles with Campbell\\'s Soup Cans, marking his West Coast debut of pop art.\\nIn November 1962, Warhol had an exhibition at Eleanor Ward\\'s Stable Gallery in New York. The exhibit included the works Gold Marilyn, eight of the classic \"Marilyn\" series also named \"Flavor Marilyns\", Marilyn Diptych, 100 Soup Cans, 100 Coke Bottles, and 100 Dollar Bills. Gold Marilyn, was bought by the architect Philip Johnson and donated to the Museum of Modern Art. At the exhibit, Warhol met poet John Giorno, who would star in Warhol\\'s first film, Sleep (1964).\\n\\nIn December 1962, New York City\\'s Museum of Modern Art hosted a symposium on pop art, during which artists such as Warhol were attacked for \"capitulating\" to consumerism. Critics were appalled by Warhol\\'s open acceptance of market culture, which set the tone for his reception.\\nIn early 1963, Warhol rented his first studio, an old firehouse at 159 East 87th Street. At this studio, he created his Elvis series, which included Eight Elvises (1963) and Triple Elvis (1963). These portraits along with a series of Elizabeth Taylor portraits were shown at his second exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. Later that year, Warhol relocated his studio to East 47th Street, which would turn into The Factory. The Factory became a popular gathering spot for a wide range of artists, writers, musicians and underground celebrities.\\nWarhol had his second exhibition at the Stable Gallery in the spring of 1964, which featured sculptures of commercial boxes stacked and scattered throughout the space to resemble a warehouse. For the exhibition, Warhol custom ordered wooden boxes and silkscreened graphics onto them. The sculptures—Brillo Box, Del Monte Peach Box, Heinz Tomato Ketchup Box, Kellogg\\'s Cornflakes Box, Campbell\\'s Tomato Juice Box and Mott\\'s Apple Juice Box—sold for $200 to $400 depending on the size of the box.\\nA pivotal event was The American Supermarket exhibition at Paul Bianchini\\'s Upper East Side gallery in the fall of 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—from the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, among them sculptor Claes Oldenburg, Mary Inman and Bob Watts. Warhol designed a $12 paper shopping bag—plain white with a red Campbell\\'s soup can. His painting of a can of a Campbell\\'s soup cost $1,500 while each autographed can sold for three for $18, $6.50 each. The exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is.\\nIn 1967 Warhol established Factory Additions for his printmaking and publishing enterprise.\\n\\nAs an advertisement illustrator in the 1950s, Warhol used assistants to increase his productivity. Collaboration would remain a defining (and controversial) aspect of his working methods throughout his career; this was particularly true in the 1960s. One of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Malanga. Malanga assisted the artist with the production of silkscreens, films, sculptures and other works at The Factory, Warhol\\'s aluminum foil-and-silver-paint-lined studio on 47th Street (later moved to Broadway). Other members of Warhol\\'s Factory crowd included Freddie Herko, Ondine, Ronald Tavel, Mary Woronov, Billy Name, and Brigid Berlin (from whom he apparently got the idea to tape-record his phone conversations).\\nDuring the 1960s, Warhol also groomed a retinue of bohemian and counterculture eccentrics upon whom he bestowed the designation \"superstars\", including Nico, Joe Dallesandro, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis and Candy Darling. These people all participated in the Factory films, and some—like Berlin—remained friends with Warhol until his death. Important figures in the New York underground art/cinema world, such as writer John Giorno and filmmaker Jack Smith, also appear in Warhol films (many premiering at the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse) of the 1960s, revealing Warhol\\'s connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time. Less well known was his support and collaboration with several teenagers during this era, who would achieve prominence later in life, including writer David Dalton, photographer Stephen Shore and artist Bibbe Hansen (mother of pop musician Beck).\\n\\n\\n==== 1968 assassination attempt ====\\nOn June 3, 1968, radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas shot Warhol and Mario Amaya, art critic and curator, at The Factory. Before the shooting, Solanas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene. She authored the SCUM Manifesto, a separatist feminist tract that advocated the elimination of men; and appeared in the 1968 Warhol film I, a Man. Earlier on the day of the attack, Solanas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. The script had apparently been misplaced.\\nWarhol and Amaya were taken to Columbus Hospital in an ambulance. Amaya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day. Warhol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived. Jed Johnson, one of the helpers at the Factory, had been in the elevator with Warhol and Solanas as they went up to the Factory. During Warhol\\'s 2-month hospitalization, Johnson visited him regularly and they developed a deep relationship. Subsequently, Johnson moved in with Warhol to help him recuperate and care for his mother Julia Warhola. Warhol had physical effects for the rest of his life, including being required to wear a surgical corset. The shooting had a profound effect on Warhol\\'s life and art.\\nSolanas was arrested the day after the assault, after turning herself in to the police. By way of explanation, she said that Warhol \"had too much control over my life\". She was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the Department of Corrections. After the shooting, the Factory scene heavily increased its security, and for many the \"Factory 60s\" ended (\"The superstars from the old Factory days didn\\'t come around to the new Factory much\").\\nWarhol had this to say about the attack:\\n\\nBefore I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it\\'s the way things happen in life that\\'s unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it\\'s like watching television—you don\\'t feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it\\'s all television.In 1969, Warhol and British journalist John Wilcock founded Interview magazine.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\nCompared to the success and scandal of Warhol\\'s work in the 1960s, the early 1970s were much quieter years, as he became more entrepreneurial. He was generally regarded as quiet, shy and a meticulous observer. Art critic Robert Hughes called him \"the white mole of Union Square\".\\nAs Warhol continued to forge into filmmaking, he had established himself as \"one of the most celebrated and well-known pop art figures to emerge from the sixties.\" The Pasadena Art Museum in Pasadena organized a major retrospective of his work in 1970, which traveled in the United States and abroad. In 1971, the retrospective was mounted at the Tate Gallery in London and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Warhol staged his first and only theater production, Andy Warhol\\'s Pork in 1971.\\nIn 1971, Warhol and his collaborator Paul Morrissey purchased Eothen, an oceanfront estate in Montauk, New York on Long Island. The Rolling Stones, Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and John Lennon were among the estate\\'s notable guests.\\nIn 1972, Warhol\\'s work was included in the inaugural show at the Art Museum of South Texas in Corpus Christi, Texas.  Between 1972 and 1973, Warhol created a series of portraits of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong.\\nWarhol was visiting Europe more often in the early 1970s. He had a fondness for Paris, and by 1973 he had purchased an apartment on rue du Cherche-Midi on Paris\\' Left Bank. In 1974, Warhol and his longtime partner Jed Johnson moved from his home on Lexington Avenue to a townhouse at 57 East 66th Street in Manhattan\\'s Lenox Hill neighborhood. \\n\\nIn 1975, he published The Philosophy of Andy Warhol. An idea expressed in the book: \"Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art.\" \\nIn 1976, Warhol and painter Jamie Wyeth were commissioned to paint each other\\'s portraits by the Coe Kerr Gallery in Manhattan. In June 1977, Andy was invited to a special reception honoring the \"Inaugural Artists\" who had contributed prints to the Jimmy Carter presidential campaign. In 1977, Warhol was commissioned by art collector Richard Weisman to create Athletes, ten portraits consisting of the leading athletes of the day.\\nThe opening of Studio 54 in 1977, ushered in a new era in New York City nightlife. Warhol would often socialize at Studio 54 and take note of the drug-fueled activities that his friends engaged in at parties. In 1977, Warhol began taking nude photographs of men in various poses and performing sexual acts that became \"landscapes\" for what became known as the Torsos and Sex Parts series. Most of the men were street hustlers and male prostitutes brought to the Factory by Halston\\'s lover Victor Hugo. This caused tension in Warhol\\'s relationship with Johnson who did not approve of his friendship with Hugo. \"When Studio 54 opened things changed with Andy. That was New York when it was at the height of its most decadent period, and I didn\\'t take part. I never liked that scene ... Andy was just wasting his time, and it was really upsetting. ... He just spent his time with he most ridiculous people,\" Johnson said.\\nIn 1979, Warhol and his friend, art collector Stuart Pivar, founded the New York Academy of Art. That year, Warhol formed a publishing company, Andy Warhol Books, and released the book Exposures, which contained his photographs of famous friends and acquaintances.\\nAccording to former Interview editor Bob Colacello, Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions—including Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his wife Empress Farah Pahlavi, his sister Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, John Lennon, Diana Ross and Brigitte Bardot. In November 1979, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the exhibition Andy Warhol: Portraits of the \\'70s to celebrate the \"very commercial celebrity of the \\'70s, the decade of People magazine and designer jeans.\" Some critics disliked his exhibits of portraits of personalities and celebrities, calling them superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nWarhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the \"bull market\" of 1980s New York art: Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, David Salle and other so-called Neo-Expressionists, as well as members of the Transavantgarde movement in Europe, including Francesco Clemente and Enzo Cucchi. Warhol also earned street credibility and graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to Warhol by painting an entire train with Campbell soup cans.\\nWarhol was also being criticized for becoming merely a \"business artist\". Critics panned his 1980 exhibition Ten Portraits of Jews of the Twentieth Century at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan, which Warhol—who was uninterested in Judaism and Jews—had described in his diary as \"They\\'re going to sell.\" In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view Warhol\\'s superficiality and commerciality as \"the most brilliant mirror of our times\", contending that \"Warhol had captured something irresistible about the zeitgeist of American culture in the 1970s.\"\\nIn 1981, Warhol worked on a project with Peter Sellars and Lewis Allen that would create a traveling stage show called, A No Man Show, with a life-sized animatronic robot in the exact image of Warhol. The Andy Warhol Robot would then be able to read Warhol\\'s diaries as a theatrical production. Warhol was quoted as saying, \"I\\'d like to be a machine, wouldn\\'t you?\"\\nWarhol also had an appreciation for intense Hollywood glamour. He once said: \"I love Los Angeles. I love Hollywood. They\\'re so beautiful. Everything\\'s plastic, but I love plastic. I want to be plastic.\" Warhol occasionally walked the fashion runways and did product endorsements, represented by Zoli Agency and later Ford Models.\\nBefore the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics, he teamed with 15 other artists, including David Hockney and Cy Twombly, and contributed a Speed Skater print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed Skater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster.\\nIn 1984, Vanity Fair commissioned Warhol to produce a portrait of Prince, to accompany an article that celebrated the success of Purple Rain and its accompanying movie. Referencing the many celebrity portraits produced by Warhol across his career, Orange Prince (1984) was created using a similar composition to the Marilyn \"Flavors\" series from 1962, among some of Warhol\\'s first celebrity portraits. Prince is depicted in a pop color palette commonly used by Warhol, in bright orange with highlights of bright green and blue. The facial features and hair are screen-printed in black over the orange background.\\nIn September 1985, Warhol\\'s joint exhibition with Basquiat, Paintings, opened to negative reviews at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. That month, despite apprehension from Warhol, his silkscreen series Reigning Queens was shown at the Leo Castelli Gallery. In the Andy Warhol Diaries, Warhol wrote: \"They were supposed to be only for Europe—nobody here cares about royalty and it\\'ll be another bad review.\"\\nIn January 1987, Warhol traveled to Milan for the opening of his last exhibition, Last Supper, at the Palazzo delle Stelline. The next month, Warhol modeled with jazz musician Miles Davis for Koshin Satoh\\'s fashion show at the Tunnel in New York City on February 17, 1987.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\n\\nWarhol died in Manhattan at 6:32 a.m. on February 22, 1987, at age 58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat. Prior to his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care, saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of court; Warhol\\'s family received an undisclosed sum of money.\\nShortly before Warhol\\'s death, doctors expected Warhol to survive the surgery, though a re-evaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that Warhol\\'s surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at the time that Warhol had died of a \"routine\" surgery, though when considering factors such as his age, a family history of gallbladder problems, his previous gunshot wound, and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.\\nWarhol\\'s brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh, where an open-coffin wake was held at the Thomas P. Kunsak Funeral Home. The solid bronze casket had gold-plated rails and white upholstery. Warhol was dressed in a black cashmere suit, a paisley tie, a platinum wig, and sunglasses. He was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose. The funeral liturgy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh\\'s North Side on February 27, 1987. The eulogy was given by Monsignor Peter Tay. Yoko Ono and John Richardson were speakers. The coffin was covered with white roses and asparagus ferns.\\nAfter the liturgy, the coffin was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park, a south suburb of Pittsburgh, where Warhol was buried near his parents. The priest said a brief prayer at the graveside and sprinkled holy water on the casket. Before the coffin was lowered, Warhol\\'s close friend and associate publisher of Interview, Paige Powell, dropped a copy of the magazine and a bottle of Beautiful Eau de Parfum by Estée Lauder into the grave. A memorial service was held in Manhattan for Warhol at St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral on April 1, 1987.\\n\\n\\n== Art works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Paintings ===\\nBy the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the \"Pope of Pop\", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist\\'s palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists such as Willem de Kooning.\\nFrom these beginnings, he developed his later style and subjects. Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process. Warhol frequently used silk-screening; his later drawings were traced from slide projections. At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants, including notable artist George Condo, who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations.\\nWarhol\\'s first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit Teller\\'s window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert Rauschenberg had also once graced. It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol\\'s dollar paintings. On November 23, 1961, Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, Pop, The Genius of Warhol, was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter. For his first major exhibition, Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbell\\'s soup, which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life.\\n\\nIt was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds, electric chairs, Campbell\\'s soup cans, Coca-Cola bottles, celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African-American protesters during the Birmingham campaign in the civil rights movement. His work became popular and controversial. Warhol had this to say about Coca-Cola:What\\'s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca-Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca-Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca-Cola, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. In 1962, Warhol created his famous Marilyn series. The Flavor Marilyns were selected from a group of fourteen canvases in the sub-series, each measuring 20\" x 16\". Some of the canvases were named after various candy Life Savers flavors, including Cherry Marilyn, Lemon Marilyn and Licorice Marilyn. The others are identified by their background colors.\\nWarhol produced both comic and serious works; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series.\\nIn the 1970s, Warhol evolved into a commercial artist, painting mostly commissioned portraits of celebrities. In 1979, Warhol was commissioned to paint a BMW M1 Group 4 racing version for the fourth installment of the BMW Art Car project. He was initially asked to paint a BMW 320i in 1978, but the car model was changed and it didn\\'t qualify for the race that year. Warhol was the first artist to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer a scale-model design to the car. Reportedly, it took him only 23 minutes to paint the entire car. Racecar drivers Hervé Poulain, Manfred Winkelhock and Marcel Mignot drove the car at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans.\\nSome of Warhol\\'s work, as well as his own personality, has been described as being Keatonesque. Warhol has been described as playing dumb to the media. He sometimes refused to explain his work. He has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is \"already there \\'on the surface\\'\".\\nHis Rorschach inkblots are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be. His cow wallpaper (literally, wallpaper with a cow motif) and his oxidation paintings (canvases prepared with copper paint that was then oxidized with urine) are also noteworthy in this context. Equally noteworthy is the way these works—and their means of production—mirrored the atmosphere at Andy\\'s New York \"Factory\". Former Interview editor Bob Colacello provides some details on Andy\\'s \"piss paintings\":\\n\\nVictor ... was Andy\\'s ghost pisser on the Oxidations. He would come to the Factory to urinate on canvases that had already been primed with copper-based paint by Andy or Ronnie Cutrone, a second ghost pisser much appreciated by Andy, who said that the vitamin B that Ronnie took made a prettier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green. Did Andy ever use his own urine? My diary shows that when he first began the series, in December 1977, he did, and there were many others: boys who\\'d come to lunch and drink too much wine, and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy \\'paint\\'. Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio.\\n\\nWarhol\\'s 1982 portrait of Basquiat, Jean-Michel Basquiat, is a silkscreen over an oxidized copper \"piss painting\". After many years of silkscreen, oxidation, photography, etc., Warhol returned to painting with a brush in hand. In 1983, Warhol began collaborating with Basquiat and Clemente. Warhol and Basquiat created a series of more than 50 large collaborative works between 1984 and 1985. Despite criticism when these were first shown, Warhol called some of them \"masterpieces\", and they were influential for his later work.\\nIn 1984, Warhol was commissioned by collector and gallerist Alexander Iolas to produce work based on Leonardo da Vinci\\'s The Last Supper for an exhibition at the old refectory of the Palazzo delle Stelline in Milan, opposite from the Santa Maria delle Grazie where Leonardo da Vinci\\'s mural can be seen. Warhol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme, mostly silkscreens and paintings, and among them a collaborative sculpture with Basquiat, the Ten Punching Bags (Last Supper). The Milan exhibition that opened in January 1987 with a set of 22 silk-screens, was the last exhibition for both the artist and the gallerist. The series of The Last Supper was seen by some as \"arguably his greatest\", but by others as \"wishy-washy, religiose\" and \"spiritless\". It is the largest series of religious-themed works by any American artist.\\nArtist Maurizio Cattelan describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy Warhol: \"That\\'s probably the greatest thing about Warhol: the way he penetrated and summarized our world, to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible, and in any case useless.\" Warhol was an inspiration towards Cattelan\\'s magazine and photography compilations, such as Permanent Food, Charley, and Toilet Paper.\\nIn the period just before his death, Warhol was working on Cars, a series of paintings for Mercedes-Benz.\\n\\n\\n=== Drawings ===\\n\"Though he is often associated with printmaking—specifically silkscreen—Warhol was also an incredibly talented illustrator and draughtsman, and drawing was an integral part of his practice throughout his career. His early drawings on paper bare a resemblance to both continuous line and blind contour drawing techniques, giving his work a sense of ease and immediacy. While working primarily within commercial advertisement, he pioneered the blotted line technique, which synthesized graphite drawing on paper with elements of printmaking. Warhol continued his practice of drawing through the last years of his life and career, and the work from this later period exemplifies a long and storied career\\'s worth of honed skill and technique.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Art market ===\\nIn 1970, screens and film matrixes that had been used to produce original Warhol works in the 1960s were taken to Europe for the production of Warhol screenprints under the name \"Sunday B Morning\". Warhol signed and numbered one edition of 250 before subsequent unauthorized unsigned versions were produced. The unauthorized works were the result of a falling out between Warhol and some of his New York City studio employees who went to Brussels where they produced work stamped with \"Sunday B Morning\" and \"Add Your Own Signature Here\". Since the works began as a collaboration, Warhol facilitated exact duplication by providing the photo negatives and precise color codes. Some of the unauthorized productions bore the markings \"This is not by me, Andy Warhol\". The most famous unauthorized reproductions are 1967 Marilyn Monroe portfolio screenprints. These \"Sunday B Morning\" Marilyn Monroe prints were among those still under production as of 2013. Art galleries and dealers also market Sunday B Morning reprint versions of several other screenprint works including Flowers, Campbell\\'s Soup I, Campbell\\'s Soup Cans II,Gold Marilyn Monroe Mao and Dollare bill prints. Although the original Sunday B Morning versions had black stamps on the back, by the 1980s, they switched to blue.\\nIn the 1970s, the price of a commissioned portrait by Warhol was $25,000, two for $40,000. The value of Andy Warhol\\'s work has been on an endless upward trajectory since his death in 1987. In 2014, his works accumulated $569 million at auction, which accounted for more than a sixth of the global art market. However, there have been some dips. According to art dealer Dominique Lévy: \"The Warhol trade moves something like a seesaw being pulled uphill: it rises and falls, but each new high and low is above the last one.\" She attributes this to the consistent influx of new collectors intrigued by Warhol. \"At different moments, you\\'ve had different groups of collectors entering the Warhol market, and that resulted in peaks in demand, then satisfaction and a slow down,\" before the process repeats another demographic or the next generation.\\nIn 1998, Orange Marilyn (1964), a depiction of Marilyn Monroe, sold for $17.3 million, which at the time set a new record as the highest price paid for a Warhol artwork. In 2007, one of Warhol\\'s 1963 paintings of Elizabeth Taylor, Liz (Colored Liz), which was owned by actor Hugh Grant, sold for $23.7 million at Christie\\'s.\\nIn 2007, Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson sold Warhol\\'s Turquoise Marilyn (1964) to financier Steven A. Cohen for $80 million. In May 2007, Green Car Crash (1963) sold for $71.1 million and Lemon Marilyn (1962) sold for $28 million at Christie\\'s post-war and contemporary art auction. In 2007, Large Campbell\\'s Soup Can (1964) was sold at a Sotheby\\'s auction to a South American collector for 7.4 million. In November 2009, 200 One Dollar Bills (1962) at Sotheby\\'s for $43.8 million.\\nIn 2008, Eight Elvises (1963) was sold by Annibale Berlingieri for $100 million to a private buyer. The work depicts Elvis Presley in a gunslinger pose. It was first exhibited in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. Warhol made 22 versions of the Elvis portraits, eleven of which are held in museums. In May 2012, Double Elvis (Ferus Type) sold at auction at Sotheby\\'s for $37 million. In November 2014, Triple Elvis (Ferus Type) sold for $81.9 million at Christie\\'s.\\nIn May 2010, a purple self-portrait of Warhol from 1986 that was owned by fashion designer Tom Ford sold for $32.6 million at Sotheby\\'s. In November 2010, Men in Her Life (1962), based on Elizabeth Taylor, sold for $63.4 million at Phillips de Pury and Coca-Cola (4) (1962) sold for $35.3 million at Sotheby\\'s. In May 2011, Warhol\\'s first self-portrait from 1963 to 1964 sold for $38.4 million and a red self-portrait from 1986 sold for $27.5 million at Christie\\'s. In May 2011, Liz No. 5 (Early Colored Liz) sold for $26.9 million at Phillips.\\nIn November 2013, Warhol\\'s rarely seen 1963 diptych, Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), sold at Sotheby\\'s for $105.4 million, a new record for the artist. In November 2013, Coca-Cola (3) (1962) sold for $57.3 million at Christie\\'s. In May 2014, White Marilyn (1962) sold for $41 million at Christie\\'s. In November 2014, Four Marlons (1964), which depicts Marlon Brando, sold for $69.6 million at Christie\\'s. In May 2015, Silver Liz (diptych), painted in 1963, sold for $28 million and Colored Mona Lisa (1963) sold for $56.2 million at Christie\\'s. In May 2017, Warhol\\'s 1962 painting Big Campbell\\'s Soup Can With Can Opener (Vegetable) sold for $27.5 million at Christie\\'s. In 2017, billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin purchased Orange Marilyn privately for around $200 million. In March 2022, Silver Liz (Ferus Type) sold for 2.3 billion yen ($18.9 million) at Shinwa Auction, which set a new record for the highest bid ever at auction in Japan. In May 2022, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) sold for $195 million at Christie\\'s, becoming the most expensive American artwork sold at auction.\\n\\n\\n=== Collectors ===\\nAmong Warhol\\'s early collectors and influential supporters were Emily and Burton Tremaine. Among the over 15 artworks purchased, Marilyn Diptych (now at Tate Modern, London) and A boy for Meg (now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC), were purchased directly out of Warhol\\'s studio in 1962. One Christmas, Warhol left a small Head of Marilyn Monroe by the Tremaine\\'s door at their New York apartment in gratitude for their support and encouragement.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Filmography ===\\n\\nWarhol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by La Monte Young called Trio for Strings and subsequently created his famous series of static films. Filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who accompanied Warhol to the Trio premiere, claims Warhol\\'s static films were directly inspired by the performance. Between 1963 and 1968, he made more than 60 films, plus some 500 short black-and-white \"screen test\" portraits of Factory visitors.\\nOne of his most famous films, Sleep, monitors poet John Giorno sleeping for six hours. The 35-minute film Blow Job is one continuous shot of the face of DeVeren Bookwalter supposedly receiving oral sex from filmmaker Willard Maas, although the camera never tilts down to see this. Another, Empire (1964), consists of eight hours of footage of the Empire State Building in New York City at dusk. The film Eat consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes.\\nBatman Dracula is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by Warhol, without the permission of DC Comics. It was screened only at his art exhibits. A fan of the Batman series, Warhol\\'s movie was an \"homage\" to the series, and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly campy Batman. The film was until recently thought to have been lost, until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis.\\nWarhol\\'s 1965 film Vinyl is an adaptation of Anthony Burgess\\' popular dystopian novel A Clockwork Orange. Others record improvised encounters between Factory regulars such as Brigid Berlin, Viva, Edie Sedgwick, Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn, Ondine, Nico and Jackie Curtis. The underground artist Jack Smith appears in the film Camp.\\nHis most popular and critically successful film was Chelsea Girls (1966). The film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm-films being projected simultaneously, with two different stories being shown in tandem. From the projection booth, the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that \"story\" while it was lowered for the other. The multiplication of images evoked Warhol\\'s seminal silk-screen works of the early 1960s.\\nWarhol was a fan of filmmaker Radley Metzger\\'s film work and commented that Metzger\\'s film, The Lickerish Quartet, was \"an outrageously kinky masterpiece\". Blue Movie—a film in which Warhol superstars Viva and Louis Waldon make love in bed with—was Warhol\\'s last film as director. The film, a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn, was, at the time, controversial for its frank approach to a sexual encounter. Blue Movie was publicly screened in New York City in 2005, for the first time in more than 30 years.\\nIn the wake of the 1968 shooting, Warhol\\'s assistant director, Paul Morrissey, took over most of the film-making chores for the Factory collective, steering Warhol-branded cinema towards more mainstream, narrative-based, B-movie exploitation fare with Flesh, Trash and Heat. All of these films, including the later Andy Warhol\\'s Dracula and Andy Warhol\\'s Frankenstein, were far more mainstream than anything Warhol as a director had attempted. These latter \"Warhol\" films starred Joe Dallesandro, more of a Morrissey star than a true Warhol superstar. The last Factory film, Bad, starred Carroll Baker and was made without either Morrissey or Dallesandro. It was directed by Warhol\\'s lover Jed Johnson, who had assisted Morrissey on several films.\\nMost of the films directed by Warhol were pulled out of circulation by Warhol and the people around him who ran his business. After Warhol\\'s death, the films were slowly restored by the Whitney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals. Few of the Warhol-directed films are available on video or DVD.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nIn the mid-1960s, Warhol adopted the band the Velvet Underground, making them a crucial element of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia performance art show. Warhol, with Paul Morrissey, acted as the band\\'s manager, introducing them to Nico (who would perform with the band at Warhol\\'s request). While managing The Velvet Underground, Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting. In 1966, he \"produced\" their first album The Velvet Underground & Nico, as well as providing its album art. His actual participation in the album\\'s production amounted to simply paying for the studio time.\\nAfter the band\\'s first album, Warhol and band leader Lou Reed started to disagree more about the direction the band should take, and their artistic friendship ended. In 1989, after Warhol\\'s death, Reed and John Cale re-united for the first time since 1972 to write, perform, record and release the concept album Songs for Drella, a tribute to Warhol. In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Reed, based on Warhols\\' 1975 book, \"The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again\", was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.\\nWarhol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of John Wallowitch\\'s debut album, This Is John Wallowitch!!! (1964). He designed the cover art for The Rolling Stones\\' albums Sticky Fingers (1971) and Love You Live (1977), and the John Cale albums The Academy in Peril (1972) and Honi Soit in 1981. One of Warhol\\'s last works was a portrait of Aretha Franklin for the cover of her 1986 gold album Aretha.\\nIn 1984, Warhol co-directed the music video \"Hello Again\" by the Cars, and he appeared in the video as a bartender. In 1986, Warhol co-directed the music video \"Misfit\" by Curiosity Killed the Cat and he made a cameo in video.\\n\\n\\n=== Books and print ===\\n\\nBeginning in the early 1950s, Warhol produced several unbound portfolios of his work.\\nThe first of several bound self-published books by Warhol was 25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy, printed in 1954 by Seymour Berlin on Arches brand watermarked paper using his blotted line technique for the lithographs. The original edition was limited to 190 numbered, hand-colored copies, using Dr. Martin\\'s ink washes. Most of these were given by Warhol as gifts to clients and friends. Copy No. 4, inscribed \"Jerry\" on the front cover and given to Geraldine Stutz, was used for a facsimile printing in 1987, and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US$35,000 by Doyle New York.\\nOther self-published books by Warhol include:\\n\\nA Gold Book\\nWild Raspberries\\nHoly Cats\\nWarhol\\'s book A La Recherche du Shoe Perdu (1955) marked his \"transition from commercial to gallery artist\". (The title is a play on words by Warhol on the title of French author Marcel Proust\\'s À la recherche du temps perdu.)\\nAfter gaining fame, Warhol \"wrote\" several books that were commercially published:\\n\\nA, a novel (1968, ISBN 978-0-8021-3553-7) is a literal transcription—containing spelling errors and phonetically written background noise and mumbling—of audio recordings of Ondine and several of Andy Warhol\\'s friends hanging out at the Factory, talking, going out.\\nThe Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again) (1975, ISBN 978-0-15-671720-5)—according to Pat Hackett\\'s introduction to The Andy Warhol Diaries, Pat Hackett did the transcriptions and text for the book based on daily phone conversations, sometimes (when Warhol was traveling) using audio cassettes that Andy Warhol gave her. Said cassettes contained conversations with Brigid Berlin (also known as Brigid Polk) and former Interview magazine editor Bob Colacello.\\nExposures (1979, ISBN 9780448128504), authored by Warhol and Bob Colacello, is a book of Warhol\\'s photographs of his famous friends with anecdotes.\\nPopism: The Warhol Sixties (1980, ISBN 978-0-15-672960-4), authored by Warhol and Pat Hackett, is a retrospective view of the 1960s and the role of pop art.\\nThe Andy Warhol Diaries (1989, ISBN 978-0-446-39138-2), edited by Pat Hackett, is a diary dictated by Warhol to Hackett in daily phone conversations. Warhol started the diary to keep track of his expenses after being audited, although it soon evolved to include his personal and cultural observations.\\nWarhol created the fashion magazine Interview that is still published. The loopy title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother, Julia Warhola, who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces.\\n\\n\\n=== Other media ===\\nAlthough Andy Warhol is most known for his paintings and films, he authored works in many different media.\\n\\nDrawing: Warhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, producing drawings in \"blotted-ink\" style for advertisements and magazine articles. Best known of these early works are his drawings of shoes. Some of his personal drawings were self-published in small booklets, such as Yum, Yum, Yum (about food), Ho, Ho, Ho (about Christmas) and Shoes, Shoes, Shoes. His most artistically acclaimed book of drawings is probably A Gold Book, compiled of sensitive drawings of young men. A Gold Book is so named because of the gold leaf that decorates its pages. In April 2012 a sketch of 1930s singer Rudy Vallee claimed to have been drawn by Andy Warhol was found at a Las Vegas garage sale. The image was said to have been drawn when Andy was nine or 10. Various authorities have challenged the image\\'s authenticity.\\nSculpture: Warhol\\'s most famous sculpture is probably his Brillo Boxes, silkscreened ink on wood replicas of the large, branded cardboard boxes used to hold 24 packages of Brillo soap pads. The original Brillo design was by commercial artist James Harvey. Warhol\\'s sculpture was part of a series of \"grocery carton\" works that also included Heinz ketchup and Campbell\\'s tomato juice cases. Other famous works include the Silver Clouds—helium filled, silver mylar, pillow-shaped balloons. A Silver Cloud was included in the traveling exhibition Air Art (1968–1969) curated by Willoughby Sharp. Clouds was also adapted by Warhol for avant-garde choreographer Merce Cunningham\\'s dance piece RainForest (1968).\\nAudio: At one point Warhol carried a portable recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said and did. He referred to this device as his \"wife\". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol\\'s was his Invisible Sculpture, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol\\'s cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.\\nTime Capsules: In 1973, Warhol began saving ephemera from his daily life—correspondence, newspapers, souvenirs, childhood objects, even used plane tickets and food—which was sealed in plain cardboard boxes dubbed Time Capsules. By the time of his death, the collection grew to include 600, individually dated \"capsules\". The boxes are now housed at the Andy Warhol Museum.\\nTelevision: Andy Warhol dreamed of a television special about a favorite subject of his – Nothing – that he would call The Nothing Special. Later in his career he did create two cable television shows, Andy Warhol\\'s TV in 1982 and Andy Warhol\\'s Fifteen Minutes (based on his famous \"fifteen minutes of fame\" quotation) for MTV in 1986. Besides his own shows he regularly made guest appearances on other programs, including The Love Boat wherein a Midwestern wife (Marion Ross) fears Andy Warhol will reveal to her husband (Tom Bosley, who starred alongside Ross in sitcom Happy Days) her secret past as a Warhol superstar named Marina del Rey. Warhol also produced a TV commercial for Schrafft\\'s Restaurants in New York City, for an ice cream dessert appropriately titled the \"Underground Sundae\".\\nFashion: Warhol is quoted for having said: \"I\\'d rather buy a dress and put it up on the wall, than put a painting, wouldn\\'t you?\" One of his best-known superstars, Edie Sedgwick, aspired to be a fashion designer, and his good friend Halston was a famous one. Warhol\\'s work in fashion includes silkscreened dresses, a short sub-career as a catwalk-model and books on fashion as well as paintings with fashion (shoes) as a subject. Warhol himself has been described as a modern dandy, whose authority \"rested more on presence than on words\".\\nPerformance Art: Warhol and his friends staged theatrical multimedia happenings at parties and public venues, combining music, film, slide projections and even Gerard Malanga in an S&M outfit cracking a whip. The Exploding Plastic Inevitable in 1966 was the culmination of this area of his work.\\nTheater: Warhol\\'s play Andy Warhol\\'s Pork opened on May 5, 1971, at LaMama theater in New York for a two-week run and was brought to the Roundhouse in London for a longer run in August 1971. Pork was based on tape-recorded conversations between Brigid Berlin and Andy during which Brigid would play for Andy tapes she had made of phone conversations between herself and her mother, socialite Honey Berlin. The play featured Jayne County as \"Vulva\" and Cherry Vanilla as \"Amanda Pork\". In 1974, Andy Warhol also produced the stage musical Man on the Moon, which was written by John Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas.\\n\\nPhotography: To produce his silkscreens, Warhol made photographs or had them made by his friends and assistants. These pictures were mostly taken with a specific model of Polaroid camera, The Big Shot, that Polaroid kept in production especially for Warhol. This photographic approach to painting and his snapshot method of taking pictures has had a great effect on artistic photography. Warhol was an accomplished photographer, and took an enormous number of photographs of Factory visitors, friends, acquired by Stanford University.\\nMusic: In 1963, Warhol founded The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community.\\nComputer: Warhol used Amiga computers to generate digital art, including You Are the One, which he helped design and build with Amiga, Inc. He also displayed the difference between slow fill and fast fill on live TV with Debbie Harry as a model.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sexuality ===\\nWarhol lived as a gay man before the gay liberation movement. In 1980, Warhol told an interviewer that he was still a virgin. Former Interview editor Bob Colacello, who was present at the interview, felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably \"a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use [Andy\\'s] word abstract.\" Warhol\\'s assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. His friend Charles Lisanby, whom Warhol had romantic feelings for but it was unrequited love, said Warhol told him sex was \"messy and distasteful.\" \"He told me he\\'d had sex a few times, he had tried it and didn\\'t really like it,\" said Lisanby. Furthermore, some of Warhol\\'s other friends claimed to have either witnessed Warhol having sex or heard him talking about his sexual relations.\\nDue to Warhol\\'s own admission that he was asexual, it has been assumed that his relationships were platonic. Warhol superstar Jay Johnson said, \"He enjoyed the idea that he was considered a voyeur and that he was considered asexual. That was his mystique.\" The Factory photographer and Warhol\\'s lover Billy Name stated that he was \"the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity ... It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York.\" \"But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front,\" said Name. Warhol\\'s other lovers included aspiring filmmaker Danny Williams, artist John Giorno, and Paramount Pictures executive Jon Gould. His longest-lasting relationship was with Jed Johnson, who had nursed him back to health after he was shot then became his collaborator and later achieved fame as an interior designer. Warhol and Johnson \"functioned as husband and husband, sharing a bed and a domestic life\" for 12 years.\\nThe fact that Warhol\\'s homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (e.g., Popism: The Warhol 1960s). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor and films such as Blow Job, My Hustler and Lonesome Cowboys) draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters, including the New Andy Warhol Garrick Theatre and 55th Street Playhouse, in the late 1960s.\\nThe first works that Warhol submitted to a fine art gallery, homoerotic drawings of male nudes, were rejected for being too openly gay. In Popism, furthermore, the artist recalls a conversation with the filmmaker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty Warhol had being accepted socially by the then-more-famous (but closeted) gay artists Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. De Antonio explained that Warhol was \"too swish and that upsets them\". In response to this, Warhol writes, \"There was nothing I could say to that. It was all too true. So I decided I just wasn\\'t going to care, because those were all the things that I didn\\'t want to change anyway, that I didn\\'t think I \\'should\\' want to change ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me\". In exploring Warhol\\'s biography, many turn to this period—the late 1950s and early 1960s—as a key moment in the development of his persona.\\nSome have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work, to speak about himself (confining himself in interviews to responses like \"Um, no\" and \"Um, yes\", and often allowing others to speak for him)—and even the evolution of his pop style—can be traced to the years when Warhol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world.\\n\\n\\n=== Religion ===\\n\\nWarhol was a practicing Ruthenian Catholic. He regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in New York City, particularly during the busier times of the year, and described himself as a religious person. Many of Warhol\\'s later works depicted religious subjects, including two series, Details of Renaissance Paintings (1984) and The Last Supper (1986). In addition, a body of religious-themed works was found posthumously in his estate.\\nWarhol regularly attended Mass, and the priest at Warhol\\'s church, Saint Vincent Ferrer, said that the artist went there almost daily, although he was not observed taking Communion or going to Confession and sat or knelt in the pews at the back. The priest thought he was afraid of being recognized; Warhol said he was self-conscious about being seen in a Latin Catholic church crossing himself \"in the Orthodox way\" (right to left instead of the reverse).\\nWarhol\\'s art is noticeably influenced by the Eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship. Warhol\\'s brother has described the artist as \"really religious, but he didn\\'t want people to know about that because [it was] private\". Despite the private nature of his faith, in Warhol\\'s eulogy John Richardson depicted it as devout: \"To my certain knowledge, he was responsible for at least one conversion. He took considerable pride in financing his nephew\\'s studies for the priesthood\".\\n\\n\\n=== Collections ===\\nWarhol was an avid collector. His friends referred to his numerous collections, which filled not only his four-story townhouse, but also a nearby storage unit, as \"Andy\\'s Stuff\". The true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death, when The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his \"Stuff\".\\nWarhol\\'s collections included a Coca-Cola memorabilia sign, and 19th century paintings along with airplane menus, unpaid invoices, pizza dough, pornographic pulp novels, newspapers, stamps, supermarket flyers and cookie jars, among other eccentricities. It also included significant works of art, such as George Bellows\\'s Miss Bentham. One of his main collections was his wigs. Warhol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hairpieces, which were sewn by a New York wig-maker from hair imported from Italy. In 1985, a girl snatched Warhol\\'s wig off his head. It was later discovered in Warhol\\'s diary entry for that day that he wrote: \"I don\\'t know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony.\"\\nIn 1960, he had bought a drawing of a light bulb by Jasper Johns. Another item found in Warhol\\'s boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a mummified human foot from Ancient Egypt. The curator of anthropology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History felt that Warhol most likely found it at a flea market.\\nWarhol collected many books, with more than 1,200 titles in his collection. Of these, 139 titles have been publicly identified through a 1988 Sotheby\\'s Auction catalog, The Andy Warhol Collection and can be viewed online. His book collection reflects his eclectic taste and interests, and includes books written by and about some of his acquaintances and friends. Some of the titles in his collection include The Two Mrs. Grenvilles: A Novel by Dominick Dunne, Artists in Uniform by Max Eastman, Andrews\\' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology by George Clinton Andrews, D.V. by Diana Vreeland, Blood of a Poet by Jean Cocteau, Watercolours by Francesco Clemente, Little World, Hello! by Jimmy Savo, Hidden Faces by Salvador Dalí and The Dinah Shore Cookbook.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nIn 1998, Warhol\\'s Upper East Side townhouse at 57 E 66th Street in Manhattan was designated a cultural landmark by the Historical Landmarks Preservation Center to commemorate the 70th anniversary of his birthday.\\nIn 2002, the US Postal Service issued an 18-cent stamp commemorating Warhol. Designed by Richard Sheaff of Scottsdale, Arizona, the stamp was unveiled at a ceremony at The Andy Warhol Museum and features Warhol\\'s painting \"Self-Portrait, 1964\". In March 2011, a chrome statue of Andy Warhol and his Polaroid camera was revealed at Union Square in New York City.\\nA crater on Mercury was named after Warhol in 2012.\\nIn 2013, to honor the 85th anniversary of Warhol\\'s birthday, The Andy Warhol Museum and EarthCam launched a collaborative project titled Figment, a live feed of Warhol\\'s gravesite.\\n\\n\\n=== Warhol Foundation ===\\nWarhol\\'s will dictated that his entire estate—with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members—would go to create a foundation dedicated to the \"advancement of the visual arts\". Warhol had so many possessions that it took Sotheby\\'s nine days to auction his estate after his death; the auction grossed more than $20 million.\\nIn 1987, in accordance with Warhol\\'s will, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts was formed. The foundation serves as the estate of Andy Warhol, but also has a mission \"to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process\" and is \"focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature\".\\nThe Artists Rights Society is the US copyright representative for the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all Warhol works with the exception of Warhol film stills. The US copyright representative for Warhol film stills is the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Additionally, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive. All digital images of Warhol are exclusively managed by Corbis, while all transparency images of Warhol are managed by Art Resource.\\nThe Andy Warhol Foundation released its 20th Anniversary Annual Report as a three-volume set in 2007: Vol. I, 1987–2007; Vol. II, Grants & Exhibitions; and Vol. III, Legacy Program.\\nThe Foundation is in the process of compiling its catalogue raisonné of paintings and sculptures in volumes covering blocks of years of the artist\\'s career. Volumes IV and V were released in 2019. The subsequent volumes are still in the process of being compiled.\\nThe Foundation remains one of the largest grant-giving organizations for the visual arts in the US.\\nMany of Warhol\\'s works and possessions are on display at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. The foundation donated more than 3,000 works of art to the museum.\\n\\n\\n=== Revelation in Brooklyn ===\\nFrom November 19, 2021 – June 19, 2022, the Brooklyn Museum displayed the Andy Warhol: Revelation exhibition. Revelation examines themes such as life and death, power and desire, the role and representation of women, Renaissance imagery, family and immigrant traditions and rituals, depictions and duplications of Christ and the Catholic body and queer desire. Among the more than one hundred objects on view were rare source materials and newly discovered items that provide a fresh and intimate look at Warhol\\'s creative process, as well as major paintings from his epic Last Supper series (1986), the experimental film The Chelsea Girls (1966), an unfinished film depicting the setting sun commissioned by the de Menil family and funded by the Roman Catholic Church and drawings created by Warhol\\'s mother, Julia Warhola, when she lived with her son in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== In pop culture ==\\nWarhol founded Interview, a stage for celebrities he \"endorsed\" and a business staffed by his friends. One might even say that he produced people (as in the Warholian \"Superstar\" and the Warholian portrait). Warhol endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from Love Boat to Saturday Night Live, as well as the Richard Pryor movie Dynamite Chicken).\\nIn this respect Warhol was a fan of \"Art Business\" and \"Business Art\"—he, in fact, wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in The Philosophy of Andy Warhol from A to B and Back Again.\\n\\n\\n=== Films ===\\n\\nWarhol appeared as himself in the film Cocaine Cowboys (1979) and in the film Tootsie (1982).\\nAfter his death, Warhol was portrayed by Crispin Glover in Oliver Stone\\'s film The Doors (1991), by Jared Harris in Mary Harron\\'s film I Shot Andy Warhol (1996) and by David Bowie in Julian Schnabel\\'s film Basquiat (1996). Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:\\n\\nI met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes. The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically. He wanted to be very superficial. And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish. Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn\\'t do anything. But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film [Basquiat...] We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed. Even the pockets weren\\'t emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale fond de teint which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone\\'s address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig. Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs. One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair. When the wig was trimmed, he put on another next month as if his hair had grown.\\nWarhol appears as a character in Michael Daugherty\\'s opera Jackie O (1997). Actor Mark Bringleson makes a brief cameo as Warhol in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997). Many films by avant-garde cineast Jonas Mekas have caught the moments of Warhol\\'s life. Sean Gregory Sullivan depicted Warhol in the film 54 (1998). Guy Pearce portrayed Warhol in the film Factory Girl (2007) about Edie Sedgwick\\'s life. Actor Greg Travis portrays Warhol in a brief scene from the film Watchmen (2009). Comedian Conan O\\'Brien portrayed Warhol in the film Weird: The Al Yankovic Story (2022).\\nIn the movie Highway to Hell a group of Andy Warhols are part of the Good Intentions Paving Company where good-intentioned souls are ground into pavement. In the film Men in Black 3 (2012) Andy Warhol turns out to really be undercover MIB Agent W (played by Bill Hader). Warhol is throwing a party at The Factory in 1969, where he is encountered by MIB Agents K and J.\\nAndy Warhol (portrayed by Tom Meeten) is one of main characters of the 2012 British television show Noel Fielding\\'s Luxury Comedy. The character is portrayed as having robot-like mannerisms. In the 2017 feature The Billionaire Boys Club, Cary Elwes portrays Warhol in a film based on the true story about Ron Levin (portrayed by Kevin Spacey) a friend of Warhol\\'s who was murdered in 1986. In September 2016, it was announced that Jared Leto would portray the title character in Warhol, an upcoming American biographical drama film produced by Michael De Luca and written by Terence Winter, based on the book Warhol: The Biography by Victor Bockris.\\n\\n\\n=== Documentaries ===\\nAbsolut Warhola (2001) was produced by Polish director Stanislaw Mucha, featuring Warhol\\'s parents\\' family and hometown in Slovakia.\\nAndy Warhol: A Documentary Film (2006) is a reverential, four-hour movie by Ric Burns that won a Peabody Award in 2006.\\nAndy Warhol: Double Denied (2006) is a 52-minute movie by Ian Yentob about the difficulties authenticating Warhol\\'s work.\\nAndy Warhol\\'s People Factory (2008), a three-part television documentary directed by Catherine Shorr, features interviews with several of Warhol\\'s associates.\\nThe Andy Warhol Diaries (2022), a six-part docuseries directed by Andrew Rossi, was released on Netflix chronicling Warhol\\'s life from the vantage point of his diaries.\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nWarhol appeared as a recurring character in TV series Vinyl, played by John Cameron Mitchell. Warhol was portrayed by Evan Peters in the American Horror Story: Cult episode \"Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag\". The episode depicts the attempted assassination of Warhol by Valerie Solanas (Lena Dunham).\\nIn early 1969, Andy Warhol was commissioned by Braniff International to appear in two television commercials to promote the luxury airline\\'s \"When You Got It – Flaunt It\" campaign. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Lois Holland Calloway, which was led by George Lois, creator of a famed series of Esquire covers. The first commercial series involved pairing unlikely people who shared the fact that they both flew Braniff Airways. Warhol was paired with boxing legend Sonny Liston. The odd commercial worked, as did the others that featured unlikely fellow travelers, such as painter Salvador Dalí and baseball legend Whitey Ford.\\nTwo additional commercials for Braniff were created that featured famous persons entering a Braniff jet and being greeted by a Braniff hostess, while espousing their like for flying Braniff. Warhol was also featured in the first of these commercials that were also produced by Lois and were released in the summer of 1969. Lois has incorrectly stated that he was commissioned by Braniff in 1967 for representation during that year, but at that time Madison Avenue advertising doyenne Mary Wells Lawrence, who was married to Braniff\\'s chairman and president Harding Lawrence, was representing the Dallas-based carrier at that time. Lois succeeded Wells Rich Greene Agency on December 1, 1968. The rights to Warhol\\'s films for Braniff and his signed contracts are owned by a private trust and are administered by Braniff Airways Foundation in Dallas, Texas.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nWarhol strongly influenced the new wave/punk rock band Devo, as well as David Bowie. Bowie recorded a song called \"Andy Warhol\" for his 1971 album Hunky Dory. Lou Reed wrote the song \"Andy\\'s Chest\", about Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968. He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the VU album in 1985. The band Triumph also wrote a song about Andy Warhol, \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" off their 1984 album Thunder Seven.\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nMany books have been written about Warhol. In 1989, the biography The Life and Death of Andy Warhol by author Victor Bockris was published. Bockris expanded the book in 2003 for the 75th anniversary of Warhol\\'s birth and called it Warhol: The Biography. Former Interview editor Bob Colacello wrote the book Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Close Up, which was published in 1990. A biography written by art critic Blake Gopnik was published in 2020 under the title Warhol.\\n\\n\\n=== Comic books ===\\nWarhol is featured as a character in the Miracleman series of comics. It is first mentioned that he was resurrected by the alien scientist Mors and subsequently convinces the latter to mass-produce copies of himself. Later on, 18 copies of Warhol are seen in the underworld beneath the pyramid structure Olympus, where they produce pop art relating to the new superhuman regime. One Warhol clone numbered 6 is assigned to and develop a friendship with a clone of Emil Gargunza (Miracleman\\'s creator) before the latter\\'s betrayal and attempted escape.\\n\\n\\n=== Video games ===\\nWarhol (played by Jeff Grace) makes a cameo appearance in the 2022 video game Immortality.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n49 artworks by or after Andy Warhol at the Art UK site\\nAndy Warhol at the National Gallery of Art\\nWarhol Foundation in New York City\\nAndy Warhol Collection in Pittsburgh\\nThe work of Andy Warhol spoken about by David Cronenberg\\nWarholstars: Andy Warhol Films, Art and Superstars\\nWarhol & The Computer\\nAndy Warhol biography\\nA Piece of Work podcast, WNYC Studios/MoMA, Tavi Gevinson and Abbi Jacobson discuss Andy Warhol\\'s Campbell\\'s Soup Cans\\nAndy Warhol\\'s Personal Book Shelf',\n",
              "  'Danelle Bergstrom (born 1957) is an Australian visual artist known for landscapes and portraits of significant Australians and International figures.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBergstrom was born in Sydney. She attended Hunters Hill High School and studied art at the Julian Ashton Art School (1973-1979) and earned a Bachelor\\'s of Art Education at Alexander Mackie CAE. Her sister is Antarctic ecologist Dr Dana Bergstrom. Bergstrom began her career in the 1980s as a high school art teacher. She moved into tertiary education as Head of Department in a visual design college in the 1990s. She began exhibiting works in the 1980s, in major art prizes and solo shows by the 1990s.\\nBergstrom has two works in the collection of the Australian National Portrait Gallery, one of Australian aviator Nancy Bird Walton entitled Pioneer, and another work entitled Vivisector of the Australian playwright David Williamson.\\nBetween 2007 and 2017 Bergstrom completed 24 public portrait commissions, including portraits of all six Chief Justices of the Northern Territory Supreme Court as part of the court\\'s centenary celebration. These are exhibited in the main hall of the Supreme Court in Darwin. Many of her commissioned portraits are found in the collections of Australian courthouses, universities, museums and private collections internationally.\\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Bergstrom\\'s notable portraits included Sir Tim Smit, President Tarja Halonen of Finland, Chancellor Ulrika Wolf-Knutts.\\nIn 2023, Bathurst Regional Art Gallery presented a major career survey exhibition, entitled \\'Afterglow\\', presenting key works from the last 25 years of the artist’s practice.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and prizes ==\\nBetween 1995 and 2016, Bergstrom was a finalist nine times of the most prestigious portraiture art prize in Australia, the Archibald Prize, awarded Highly Commended in 2004 and the Packing Room Prize twice in 1995 and 2007.\\nBergstrom has been a finalist at the Portia Geach Memorial Portrait Prize at the SH Irvin Gallery fifteen times between the years 1993 and 2015, winning the People Choice Award five times.\\n\\n\\n== Portraits ==\\nBergstrom has painted portraits of many notable people. She often uses more than one canvas in her portraits to create a time sequence or capture different aspects of her subject. She described her tryptic of Marget Olley saying: \"Using three images in one work became important in expressing time and movement in the final concept: our conversations together. The first panel is more distant, a warm, friendly greeting. The second is about dialogue and exchanging ideas. The third expresses an aspect of her cheeky personality.\" She also creates multiple portraits by depicting reflections such as in \\'Two movements - Peter Sculthorpe\\' and ‘JFS Transposition’\\nProminent portraits included;\\n\\n\\n=== 2021 ===\\nFinland, Åbo University, Chancellor Ulrika Wolf-Knuts, Portrait Commission,\\nFinland, President Tarja Halonen.

              "  'Antonio José Caro Lopera (10 December 1950 – 29 March 2021) was a Colombian conceptual artist who created works since the late 1960s. He typically used non-traditional forms to create politically and socially charged critiques of Colombian issues. He died in Bogotá on 29 March 2021, aged 70.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\nSince 1970, Caro built a career that, according to the categorizations of history and criticism, denotes an authentic example of conceptual art in Colombia. \\nHe achieved his results through the implementation of informal procedures in traditional artistic practice, including photocopying, public installations, lectures, posters, and materials related to indigenous cultural practices, such as salt or achiote. The vast majority of his work makes use of text as a tool to communicate strong messages, but instead acquires the paradoxical nuances of a political nature as a means of production and dissemination.  In 1998, Caro received the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship.\\nSome of his important works include: Sal (1971), Imperialism is a Paper Tiger (1972), There is No Case (1974), Colombia-Marlboro (1975), Colombia-Coca Cola (1977), Defend Your Talent (1977), Todo está muy Caro (Everything is too expensive; 1978), Homage to Manuel Quintin Lame (1979), Project 500 (1987), and Onoto, among others.\\n\\n\\n== Style ==\\nCaro\\'s use of unusual materials included metal, cardstock, salt, and poster boards. He was a strong advocate against traditional art forms and, throughout his career, found ways to stray from the typical. He had a passion for creating art with a social or political message. Nearly all of his works are a political or social critique regarding what he believed to be important global and strictly Colombian issues.\\n\\n\\n== Early career ==\\n\\nCaro first became interested in art at the age of 16, while still in high school. He attributed his early interest in art to two specific pieces the Tributo de los Artistas Colombians a Dante (A Tribute by Colombian Artists to Dante) and Espacios Ambientales (Environmental Spaces).\\nHe decided to enroll in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota as a Fine Art student shortly after completing high school. However, despite his intense passion for art he dropped out of the university, attributing his lack of academic success to his inability to complete the general curriculum. Despite this, his time at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia brought him closer to political movements that he was interested in as well as brought him an influential mentor, Bernado Salcedo. According to Caro, Salcedo was his most influential role model. Together, they became pivotal founders in the Colombian conceptual art movement. Salcedo introduced Caro to text based art in the late 1960s inspiring him to create SAL. A text based piece of the word sal [Spanish for salt] made from salt. The work was presented in Cali, at the Primera Bienal Americana de Artes Gráficas in 1971. \\nSAL was one of the first of its kind in Colombia and naturally it aroused critics who claimed artwork lacked a standing in traditional forms. The criticism brought on Caro and Salcedo in the early 1970s inspired them to produce more idea based works rooted in Colombian social issues. As a result, the movement Caro and Salcedo had established in Colombia began to grow apart from conceptual art movements of the same time period in other Latin American countries.\\n\\n\\n== Formative period ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cabeza de Lleras ===\\nPresented in October 1970 at the XXI Salón Nacional de Artistas that took place at the Museo Nacional in Bogotá. The work is a bust made from salt that is seen wearing a pair of glasses encased in a glass container on a pedestal. Water gallery floor to symbolize a denunciatory act on the hegemonic values of society. The result created by the artwork prompted journalist Alegre Levy to write \"¡Se inundó el salon!” (\"The Salon Flooded!\") in her article in Bogotá’s major daily newspaper El Tiempo. A saying which has stuck with the piece ever since.\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Cabeza de Lleras ====\\nDuring the 1960s into the late 1970s Colombian political group El Frente Nacional took power over the Conservative and Liberal Parties of Colombia. The group claimed to be a unifying force between the opposing interests which had devastated the country in the previous decades. \\nEl Frente Nacional, however, proved to be an oligarchy composed of important business interests and Catholic Church authorities. The group had essentially filled the vacuum of power left being by the warring Conservatives and Liberals of Colombia and instead established their own tyrannical state under a pretext of democracy. Caro\\'s work captures a representation of one of the early presidents of the group, Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Cabeza de Lleras was made to capture both the insufficiencies and weaknesses of the political hierarchy Lleras represented as well as the cultural destruction and undermining that was beginning to take place. The salt which makes up the bust of Lleras represented both the weakness of the current government according to Caro as well as the cultural traditions of the Chibcha indigenous civilization. \\nIn the original title, Homenaje tardío de sus amigos y amigas de Zipaquirá, Manaure y Galerazamba (Late Homage From his Friends of Zipaquirá, Manaure and Galerazamba), the three cities mentioned Zipaquirá, Manaure and Galerazamba are Colombian cities known for their ancient salt mining industries. \\nFurthermore, the water poured into the venue according to Caro established the ever-present waters of history which were to eventually dissolve the tyrannical hierarchy of oppression and along with it the cultural backbone of Colombia.\\n\\n\\n=== Aquí no cabe el Arte ===\\nFirst presented at the XXIII Salón de Artistas Nacionales (1972) in Bogotá, Aquí no cabe el Arte (Art Does Not Fit Here) by Caro was the only text based art of its kind among the forty four other works presented at the time. The piece was made of sixteen white poster boards with a sharp, and angular letter written in bold in the center of each poster. Each letter was placed side by side and together measured eleven meters in length. Underneath each poster lies the name of a victim killed by tyrannical governmental forces in Colombia, mainly El Frente. Caro is attempting to use the power of written words to bring attention to political injustice.\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Aquí no cabe el Arte ====\\nCaro\\'s Aquí no cabe el Arte came in the wake of the election of Misael Pastrana Borrero as Colombia\\'s President. After taking office in 1970, Borrero began instituting martial law, and as a result began to suppress civil liberties. Forceful action used against organized political strikes as well as the elimination of popular local leaders became increasingly numerous during Borrero\\'s term. As a result of the political atmosphere in Colombia, Caro created the work to highlight the many atrocities being committed at the time. Some of the most well known events include the murder of university student, Romulo Carvahlo during the presidency of Carlos Lleras Restrepo. Carvahlo\\'s death is described by Caro to be an antecedent for the massacre of students after an organized insurrection during Borrero\\'s term as president. Furthermore, also mentioned in the work is the brutal massacre of Guahibo indigenous peoples in Colombia`s Planas region. Among others, these two events struck Caro as noteworthy for people to bring their attention too and as a result were a big reason behind the creation of the piece.\\n\\n\\n=== El imperialismo es un tigre de papel ===\\nOriginally exhibited in 1973 at the Nombres nuevos en el arte de Colombia (New Names in the Art of Colombia), El imperialismo es un tigre de papel (Imperialism is a Paper Tiger) was the recreation of Mao Tse Tung\\'s famous expression Imperialism is a Paper Tiger. The work is a red banner made of silk, typically used in protests. Painted on the banner were large white letters, forming Mao\\'s famous statement.\\nAdditionally, on each side of the banner Caro placed a total of twelve silhouette tigers to effectively use environmental spaces at the exhibit. The action of setting up the individual tigers was captured in a famous photograph taken of the work by reporters at La Republica.\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of El imperialismo es un tigre de papel ====\\nCaro\\'s reinstatement of Mao\\'s saying was created to bring light to the influence of Mao\\'s Little Red book to the establishing of new ideas among young Colombians. As Caro stated, \"The phrase came to me by inertia, through the context. What I did was convert the phrase into a palpable thing.\" While still fresh from the creation of Aquí no cabe el Arte, Caro wanted to use the momentum of his previous success to reenact a political critique while bringing in new ideas he had felt were politically relevant.\\n\\n\\n=== Colombia-Marlboro ===\\nIn 1973, Caro began the Marlboro project aimed at criticizing growing consumerism in Colombia. The Colombia-Marlboro project refers to a number of distinct pieces that are redesigns of Marlboro\\'s trademark logo with \"Colombia\" put in place of Marlboro. One of the most widely known pieces of this project was presented by Caro at the Agudelo Gallery, made from white cardstock and red tissue paper. Underneath the piece hung a series of flags with the Marlboro design as well as Caro\\'s name put in place of the word Marlboro.\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Colombia-Marlboro ====\\nThe purpose of Caro`s project was to highlight the growing consumer mentality he was beginning to see expand in Colombia. In order to do so he wanted to use the advertising system against major industrial powers. Although the project seemingly addresses smokers, the actual intent of the work was pertaining to a larger globalization movement that Caro was passionate about. In a statement about the project Caro described some of the main ideas he wished to bring to light \"I am not a sociologist, nor a historian, nor any of those things, but I am a myopic; this allows me to see many things from reality like for instance, that in that epoch there were a lot of people selling Marlboro on the street. From there came the proposal that consisted in fusing the design of Marlboro and the word Colombia.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Colombia-Coca-Cola ===\\nOriginally shown at the Lapiz y Papel exhibition by Jonier Marín in 1976. The work was a graphite drawing resembling the famous Coca-Cola style logo but in place of the Coca-Cola name was written “Colombia” in the same font. Later that same year Caro recreated the artwork and presented it to the XXVI Salón Nacional de Artistas. This time the piece was made from metal to better resemble Coca-Cola advertising signs. Furthermore, Colombia was painted onto the metal rather than drawn.\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Colombia-Coca-Cola ====\\nSimilarly to the context behind Colombia-Marlboro. Caro wanted to highlight the growing consumerism in Colombia that he felt was bringing forth capitalist and imperialist pressures on Colombian identity. Due to the positive feedback he had received after the Marlboro Project, Caro decided to continue the use of advertisement manipulation in order to further the spread of his ideas. Similar works were also taking place in nearby Latin American countries such as Brazil. Although it is not known whether Cildo Meireles\\' Coca-Cola Project in 1970 had any effect on Caro, the similarities are helpful in understanding the greater context for advertisement based pieces. Caro\\'s overarching desire for the piece was for it to be a symbol of the “Americanization” of Colombian industry. Caro at the time felt as if the Colombian government had essentially sold itself to the hands of American industrial giants such as Coca-Cola.\\n\\n\\n== Distinctions ==\\n1999: Nominated for the Premio Luis Caballero 211 Versión, Instituto Distrital de Cultura y Turismo, Bogotá, Colombia\\n1998: Scholarship for Artistic Residencies Colombia – México\\n1998: Guggenheim Scholarship\\n1996: Creation Scholarship, Colcultura\\n1992: Creation Scholarship, Colcultura\\n1987: Honourable Mention, XXXI Salón Nacional de Artistas, Medellín, Colombia\\n1976: Medal, XXXVI Salón Nacional de Artistas, Bogotá, Colombia\\n1972: Bolsa de trabajo, VI Salón de Agosto, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, Bogotá, Colombia\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nTate Modern, London, England, UK\\nBanco de la República, Colombia\\nMuseo de Arte Moderno, Bogotá, Colombia\\nLa Tertulia Museum, Cali, Colombia.\\nMuseo de Arte Moderno, Pereira, Colombia.\\nQueens Museum, Queens, New York, U.S.A.\\nBlanton Museum of Art, Austin, Texas, USA\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nCaro Lopera, Antonio José (2013).

              "  'Sir Antony Mark David Gormley  (born 30 August 1950) is a British sculptor. His works include the Angel of the North, a public sculpture in Gateshead in the north of England, commissioned in 1994 and erected in February 1998; Another Place on Crosby Beach near Liverpool; and Event Horizon, a multipart site installation which premiered in London in 2007, then subsequently in Madison Square in New York City (2010), São Paulo, Brazil (2012), and Hong Kong (2015–16).\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nGormley was born in Hampstead, London, the youngest of seven children, to a German mother (maiden name Brauninger) and a father of Irish descent. His paternal grandfather was an Irish Catholic from Derry who settled in Walsall in Staffordshire. The ancestral homeland of the Gormley Clan (Irish: Ó Goirmleadhaigh) in Ulster was east County Donegal and west County Tyrone, with most people in both Derry and Strabane being of County Donegal origin. Gormley has stated that his parents chose his initials, \"AMDG\", to have the inference Ad maiorem Dei gloriam – \"to the greater glory of God\".\\nGormley grew up in a Roman Catholic family living in Hampstead Garden Suburb. The family was wealthy, with  a cook and a chauffeur, with a home overlooking the golf course; Gormley\\'s father was an art lover. He attended Ampleforth College, a Benedictine boarding school in Yorkshire, before reading archaeology, anthropology, and the history of art at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1968 to 1971. He travelled to India and the Dominion of Ceylon / Sri Lanka to learn more about Buddhism between 1971 and 1974. When Gormley returned to England, and inspired by his time in India, he made one of his first artworks, Sleeping Place, by laying a plaster-soaked sheet over a friend. Its hollow plaster shell hinted at the form of a body and recalled the people Gormley saw asleep in India wrapped in saris or dhotis. \\nAfter attending Saint Martin\\'s School of Art and Goldsmiths in London from 1974, he completed his studies with a postgraduate course in sculpture at the Slade School of Fine Art, between 1977 and 1979. Gormley\\'s work as a student used natural materials such as stone and wood.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nGormley\\'s career began with a solo exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1981. In this exhibition, Gormley showed a series of works that were concerned with surfaces, skins and inner structures, such as Natural Selection, a ten metre row of objects, including tools, fruits, weapons and vegetables, encased in lead, and Room, an enclosure reminiscent of a barbed-wire fence made from a set of the artist\\'s clothes.  \\nGormley then turned his attention to the human body, creating moulds of his own body in plaster that he would then encase in lead. These works, such as the three-part sculptures Three Ways: Mould Hole and Passage and Land Sea and Air II, as well as the single body-case works Plateau, Night and Peer, attempt to investigate the body as a space. In Gormley\\'s words, \"How to make bodies into vessels that both contain and occupy space? The early three-piece lead works are the first works in which I used my own body. I was trying to map out the phenomenology of the body and to find a new way of evoking it as being less a thing, more a place; a site of transformation, and an axis of physical and spatial experience.\" Throughout the 1980s, Gormley\\'s lead body-cases were extended, suspended, sealed, pierced and also doubled into two joined forms.  \\nGormley describes his work as \"an attempt to materialise the place at the other side of appearance where we all live.\" His work attempts to treat the body not as an object, but as a place and in making works that enclose the space of a particular body to identify a condition common to all human beings. The work is not symbolic but indexical – a trace of a real event of a real body in time. \\nIn the 1990s, the hollow body-cases became solid, with Gormley casting the work in iron to create masses that displace space. One of these works, Critical Mass II, was installed in an old tram storage station in Vienna. Comprising 60 life-size sculptures, all presented in a variety of positions and poses, the work has been described by Gormley as \"an anti-monument to the victims of the 20th century\". This work has since been exhibited in a variety of countries and contexts, each time reconfigured in response to its environment. Notable presentations include the Royal Academy of Arts in London, Art Changsha in China and Forte di Belvedere in Florence.  \\nThe 2006 Sydney Biennale featured Gormley\\'s Asian Field, an installation of approximately 200,000 small clay figurines crafted by around 300 Chinese villagers in five days from 100 tons of red clay. Use of others\\' works attracted minor comment. Some figurines were stolen. Also in 2006, the burning of Gormley\\'s 25-m high The Waste Man formed the zenith of the Margate Exodus. Other collaborative projects include Clay and the Collective Body, Inside Australia, Domain Field and Gormley\\'s ongoing Field works, including Asian Field, Amazonian Field, American Field, Field for the Art Gallery of New South Wales and Field for the British Isles.\\nIn 2007, Gormley\\'s Event Horizon, consisting of 31 life-sized and anatomically correct casts of his body, four in cast iron and 27 in fiberglass, was installed on top of prominent buildings along London\\'s South Bank, and installed in locations around New York City\\'s Madison Square in 2010.  Critic Howard Halle said that \"Using distance and attendant shifts of scale within the very fabric of the city, [Event Horizon] creates a metaphor for urban life and all the contradictory associations – alienation, ambition, anonymity, fame – it entails.\"\\nIn July 2009, Gormley presented One & Other, a Fourth Plinth commission, an invitation for members of the public, chosen by lot, to spend one hour on the vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square in London. This \"living art\" happening initially attracted much media attention. It even became a topic of discussion on the long-running BBC radio drama series The Archers, where Gormley made an appearance as himself.\\nThroughout the 2000s, Gormley has interrogated the relationship between the human body and architecture, notably in his series of steel and iron \"Blockworks\". In these works, Gormley replaces anatomy with architectural blocks that recall the built environment.\\nIn March 2014, Gormley appeared in the BBC Four series What Do Artists Do All Day? in an episode that followed his team and him in their Kings Cross studio, preparing a new work – a group of 60 enormous steel figures – called Expansion Field. The work was shown at the Zentrum Paul Klee in Bern.\\nIn May 2015 five life-sized sculptures, Land, were placed near the centre and at four compass points of the UK in a commission by the Landmark Trust to celebrate its 50th anniversary. They are at Lowsonford (Warwickshire), Lundy (Bristol Channel), Saddell Bay (Scotland), the Martello Tower (Aldeburgh, Suffolk), and Clavell Tower (Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset). The Dorset sculpture was knocked over into Kimmeridge Bay by a storm in September 2015.\\nOn 6 September 2015, Another Place marked the 10th anniversary of its installation at Crosby Beach in Merseyside. Gormley commented:\\n\\nI\\'m just delighted by the barnacles!\\nEvery time I\\'m there, just like any other visitor, you\\'re encouraged to linger a bit longer seeing the tide come in and how many of them disappear. And then you\\'re encouraged to linger further until they\\'re revealed again.\\nIn September 2015, Gormley had his first sculpture installed in New Zealand. Stay is a group of identical cast-iron human form sculptures, with the first installed in the Avon River / Ōtākaro in Christchurch\\'s central city, and the other sculpture installed in the nearby Arts Centre in early 2016.\\nIn 2015, at the Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Gormley presented a group of cast iron works that acted as points of ″acupuncture″ throughout the historical fortress. Gormley returned to Florence in 2018 with the exhibition Essere at the Uffizi Gallery. The exhibition featured both historical and recent work, notably Room from 1980, Sense from 1991 and Passage from 2016.   \\nIn 2017, Gormley curated Inside, an exhibition at the Southbank Centre, London, presented by Koestler Trust showing artworks by prisoners, detainees, and ex-offenders. In addition, he judged their annual category prize, also on the theme \"inside\".\\nGormley then held the first solo exhibition at the newly remodelled Kettle\\'s Yard in Cambridge, England. Two new bodies of work, known as Rooters and Polyhedra Works, were shown that year at White Cube in Hong Kong and Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg, respectively. \\nOn 21 April 2018, Gormley released a limited edition vinyl album of ambient sounds from his studio for Record Store Day titled Sounds of the Studio. It consisted of two tracks (one on each side) titled Sounds of the Studio (Part 1) and Sounds of the Studio (Part 2). It came with an inner with a monochrome print of his studio on one side and text by the artist with a photo on the other.\\nIn 2019, Gormley populated the island of Delos with iron \"bodyforms\" with the exhibition Sight. Organised and commissioned by the NEON Organization and presented in collaboration with the Ephorate of Antiquities of Cyclades, this project marked the first time that an artist took over the archaeological site of Delos since the island was inhabited over 5,000 years ago, and is the first time a contemporary art installation has been unanimously approved by the Greek Archaeological Council of the Ministry of Culture to take place in Delos, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He installed 29 sculptures made during the last 20 years, including five new works specially commissioned by the NEON Organization, both at the periphery and integrated amongst Delos\\'s archaeological site and museum animating the geological and archaeological features of the island.\\nAlso in 2019, the Royal Academy held an exhibition filling its 13 main galleries with Gormley\\'s works, including some new (designed to fit the space), some remade for the gallery, and some of his early sculptures, with two rooms of his drawings and sketchbooks.\\nIn 2020, Gormley was confirmed to be \"lending\" a sculpture to Kirklees College to sit atop its new building at Pioneer House in Dewsbury, as part of a major redevelopment in the town.\\nIn 2022, a Gormley sculpture called Alert was installed on the main campus of Imperial College London. The installation raised objections from the student body due to its perceived \"phallic\" interpretation.\\nThat year, Gormley also held exhibitions at the Lehmbruck Museum in Duisburg, Germany and Museum Voorlinden in Wassenaar, the Netherlands. In Duisburg, his work was placed in dialogue with Wilhelm Lehmbruck\\'s expressionistic, elongated sculptures. Gormley\\'s Reflection II has remained on display at the museum.   \\nIn 2023, Gormley opened a number of large-scale exhibitions, including Living Time at TAG Art Museum in Qingdao, China, and Critical Mass at Musée Rodin in Paris, France, which marked the first time that a living artist has been invited to exhibit in all areas of the museum, including the Hôtel Biron. As part of the exhibition, Gormley showed his major artwork Critical Mass II, a sculpture comprising 60 cast iron bodies, in and around the museum and its grounds. Inside the Hôtel Biron, Gormley  placed four sculptures in dialogue with Rodin\\'s own work and also selected a number of his working models to be seen alongside Rodin\\'s plaster maquettes. Later in the year, Gormley opened Body Politic at White Cube in London, a solo exhibition of new sculptures responding to themes of movement and containment, as well as the topic of migration.     \\nIn 2024, Time Horizon, an installation of 100 cast iron sculptures, opened at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. The installation responded to the specific landscape of the parkland and the history of the Hall. Gormley also unveiled True, for Alan Turing at King\\'s College, Cambridge. This sculpture, made from slabs of Corten steel, celebrates the life and enduring influence of mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing. Speaking on the sculpture, Gormley stated \"Alan Turing unlocked the door between the industrial and the information ages. I wanted to make the best sculpture I could to honour a man who was pivotal in changing the course of all our lives. It is not about the memorialisation of a death, but about a celebration of the opportunities that a life allowed\".\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nGormley won the Turner Prize in 1994 with Field for the British Isles. \\nGormley has been a Royal Academician since 2003, and was a trustee of the British Museum from 2007 to 2015. He is an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal Institute of British Architects, honorary doctor of the universities of Teesside, Liverpool, University College London, and Cambridge, and a fellow of Trinity and Jesus Colleges, Cambridge.  In October 2010, along with 100 other leading artists, he signed an open letter to Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt protesting cutbacks in the arts.\\nOn 13 March 2011, Gormley was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance for the set design for Babel (Words) at Sadler\\'s Wells in collaboration with Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet. He was the recipient of the Obayashi Prize in 2012 and is the 2013 Praemium Imperiale laureate for sculpture. Gormley was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to the arts, having previously been appointed OBE in 1998.\\nFor Room, he received the 2015 Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture.\\nIn 2008, The Daily Telegraph ranked Gormley number four in their list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\".\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nGormley\\'s work is held in major public and private collections around the world, including the Arts Council of England; Tate, London; British Museum, London; British Council, England; National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh; Royal Academy of Arts, London; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Wellcome Collection, London; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; Middelheim Museum, Antwerp; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humblebaek; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Lehmbruck Museum, Duisburg; SCHAUWERK Sindelfingen, Sindelfingen; M+, Hong Kong; Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; Uffizi Gallery, Florence; National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo; Museum Voorlinden, Wassenaar; State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; Malmo Konsthall, Malmo; Pinchuk Art Centre, Kiev; MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Phillips Collection, Washington D.C.; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nGormley\\'s auction record is £3,401,250 for a maquette of the Angel of the North, set at Christie\\'s, London, on 14 October 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nWhile at the Slade School of Fine Art, Gormley met Vicken Parsons, who was to become his assistant, and in 1980, his wife, as well as a successful artist in her own right. The couple have a daughter and two sons.\\nGormley is a patron of Paintings in Hospitals, a charity that provides art for health and social care in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\\nIn June 2022 Gormley said that he had applied for German citizenship, to which he is entitled through his German mother, after describing Brexit as \"a practical disaster\" and a \"betrayal\".\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\nGormley\\'s website includes images of nearly all of his works and exhibitions up to 2024.

              "  'Gottfried Helnwein (born 8 October 1948) is an Austrian-Irish visual artist. He has worked as a painter, draftsman, photographer, muralist, sculptor, installation and performance artist, using a wide variety of techniques and media.\\nHis work is concerned primarily with psychological and sociological anxiety, historical issues and political topics. His subject matter is the human condition. The metaphor for his art is dominated by the image of the child, particularly the wounded child, scarred physically and emotionally from within. His works often reference taboo and controversial issues from recent history, especially the Nazi rule and the Holocaust. As a result, his work is often considered provocative and controversial.\\nHelnwein has produced artworks for rock bands the Rolling Stones, Scorpions and Rammstein. He has also partnered with Marilyn Manson in the production of The Golden Age of Grotesque and other projects.\\nHelnwein studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna. He lives and works in Ireland, where he owns the Castle Gurteen de la Poer, and Los Angeles. \\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nHelnwein was born in Vienna shortly after World War II. His father Joseph Helnwein worked for the Austrian Post and Telegraphy administration (Österreichische Post- und Telegraphenverwaltung), and his mother Margarethe was a housewife.\\nHe has four children with his wife Renate: Cyril, Mercedes, Ali Elvis and Wolfgang Amadeus, all of whom are artists. He also has three grandchildren. In 2004, Helnwein received Irish citizenship.\\n\\n\\n=== Career and education ===\\nHelnwein had a strict Roman Catholic upbringing.  As a student he organized plays and art exhibitions at the Catholic Marian Society of the Jesuit University Church in Vienna. In 1965, he enrolled at the Higher Federal Institution for Graphic Education and Experimentation. In the following years, he started his first performances for small audiences where he cut his face and hands with razor blades and bandaged himself.\\nFrom 1969 to 1973 he studied at the University of Visual Art in Vienna. He was awarded a Master-class prize (Meisterschulpreis) of the University of Visual Art, Vienna, the Kardinal-König prize and the Theodor-Körner prize. \\nHelnwein was offered a chair by the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences in 1982.  When his demand to admit also children to study at the university was rejected, he declined. In 1983, Helnwein met Andy Warhol in his Factory in New York City, who posed for a series of photo-sessions. In 1985, Rudolf Hausner recommended Helnwein as his successor as professor of the master-class for painting at the University of Visual Art in Vienna, but Helnwein left Vienna and moved to Germany.\\nHelnwein bought a medieval castle close to Cologne and the Rhine-river. Four years later, in 1989, he established a studio in Tribeca, New York, and thenceforth spent his time between the United States and Germany.\\nHelnwein moved to Dublin, Ireland, in 1997 and one year later he bought the Castle Gurteen de la Poer in County Waterford. In 2002, he established a studio in downtown Los Angeles and he lives and works since then in Ireland and Los Angeles.\\nOn 3 December 2005, his friend Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese were married in a private, non-denominational ceremony at Helnwein\\'s castle. The wedding was officiated by surrealist film director Alejandro Jodorowsky Gottfried Helnwein was best man\\nIn 2013, the Albertina Museum in Vienna organized a retrospective of Helnwein\\'s work. The show was seen by 250,000 visitors and was the most successful exhibition of a contemporary artist in the history of the Albertina.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works ==\\nHelnwein is part of a tradition going back to the 18th century, to which Messerschmidt\\'s grimacing sculptures belong. One sees, too, the common ground of his works with those of Arnulf Rainer and Hermann Nitsch, two other Viennese, who display their own bodies in the frame of reference of injury, pain, and death. And one sees how this fascination with body language goes back to the expressive gesture in the work of Egon Schiele.\\n\\n\\n=== The Child ===\\n\\nHelnwein\\'s early work consists mainly of hyperrealistic watercolors, depicting wounded children, as well as photographs and performances – often with children – in public spaces. The bandaged child became the most important figure next to the artist himself allied with him in his actions: the embodiment of the innocent, defenceless individual at the mercy of brute force.\\nArt historian Peter Gorsen specified the relation between Helnwein\\'s work and Viennese Actionism.\\nIn 2004, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco organized the first one-person exhibition of Gottfried Helnwein at an American Museum: \"The Child, works by Gottfried Helnwein\" at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor.\\nThe show was seen by almost 130,000 visitors and the San Francisco Chronicle quoted it the most important exhibition of a contemporary artist in 2004. Steven Winn, Chronicle Arts and Culture critic, wrote: \"Helnwein\\'s large format, photo-realist images of children of various demeanors boldly probed the subconscious. Innocence, sexuality, victimization and haunting self-possession surge and flicker in Helnwein\\'s unnerving work\".\\n\\n\\n=== Self portraits ===\\n\\nAt the same time when Helnwein painted watercolors of injured and abused children, from 1969, around 1970/71 he also began a series of self-portrayals in photographs and performances (actions) in his studio and in the streets of Vienna. Actionistic self-portrayals in the manner of a happening featuring his injured and bandaged body and surgical instruments deforming his face go back to Helnwein\\'s student days. Since then, bandages have become part of the aesthetic \"uniform\" of his self-portraits.\\nThe artist exposed himself as victim and martyr: bandages around his head and forks and surgical instruments piercing his mouth or cheek. Frequently the distortions of these tormented images make it difficult to recognize Helnwein\\'s face. He appears as a screaming man, mirroring the frightening aspects of life: a twentieth-century Man of Sorrows. His frozen cry, showing the artist in a state of implacable trauma, recalls Edvard Munch\\'s Scream and Francis Bacon\\'s screaming popes. Some of Helnwein\\'s grimacing faces also recall the grotesque physiognomic distortions by the eighteenth-century Viennese sculptor Franz Xavier Messerschmidt. They could also be seen as part of the Austrian pictorial tradition that resurfaced in the perturbed and distorted expressionist faces painted by Kokoschka and Egon Schiele before World War I, reappearing in the exaggerated mimicry in Arnulf Rainer\\'s \"Face Farces\".\\nWilliam S. Burroughs commented on Helnwein\\'s self-portraits in an essay in 1992:\\n\\nThere is a basic misconception that any given face, at any given time, looks more or less the same, like a statue\\'s face. Actually, the human face is as variable from moment to moment as a screen on which images are reflected, from within and from without. Gottfried Helnwein\\'s paintings and photographs attack this misconception, showing the variety of faces of which any face is capable. And in order to attack the basic misconception, he must underline and exaggerate by distortion, by bandages and metal instruments that force the face into impossible molds. Images of torture and madness abound, as happens from moment to moment in the face seen as a sensitive reflection of extreme perceptions and experience. How can a self-portrait depict statuesque calm in the face of the horrors that surround us all?\\nIn a conversation with Robert A. Sobieszek, curator of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Helnwein declared: \"The reason why I took up the subject of self-portraits and why I have put myself on stage was to function as a kind of representative for the suffering, abused and oppressed human being. I needed a living body to demonstrate and exemplify the effect of violence inflicted upon a defenseless victim. There is nothing autobiographical or therapeutical about it, and I don\\'t think it says anything about me personally. Also I was the best possible model for my experiments: endlessly patient and always available.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Comics and trivial art ===\\nAnother strong element in his works are comics. Helnwein has sensed the superiority of cartoon life over real life ever since he was a child. Growing up in a dreary, destroyed post-war Vienna, the young boy was surrounded by unsmiling people, haunted by a recent past they could never speak about. What changed his life was the first German-language Donald Duck comic book that his father brought home one day. Opening the book felt like finally arriving in a world where he belonged: \"a decent world where one could get flattened by steam-rollers and perforated by bullets without serious harm. A world in which the people still looked proper, with yellow beaks or black knobs instead of noses.\"\\nIn 2000, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art presented Helnwein\\'s painting \"Mouse I\" (1995, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210 cm x 310 cm) at the exhibition The Darker Side of Playland: Childhood Imagery from the Logan Collection.\\nAlicia Miller commented on Helnwein\\'s work in Artweek: \"In \\'The Darker Side of Playland\\', the endearing cuteness of beloved toys and cartoon characters turns menacing and monstrous. Much of the work has the quality of childhood nightmares. In those dreams, long before any adult understanding of the specific pains and evils that live holds, the familiar and comforting objects and images of a child\\'s world are rent with something untoward. For children, not understanding what really to be afraid of, these dreams portend some pain and disturbance lurking into the landscape. Perhaps nothing in the exhibition exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein\\'s \\'Mickey\\'. His portrait of Disney\\'s favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His broad smile, encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.Helnwein\\'s Mickey is painted in shades of gray, as if pictured on an old black-and-white TV set. We are meant to be transported to the flickering edges of our own childhood memories in a time imaginably more blameless, crime-less and guiltless. But Mickey\\'s terrifying demeanor hints of things to come...\".\\nSince 2018 the work \\'Dark Mousse\\' can be visited at Colección SOLO museum in Madrid, where it is part of its permanent exhibition.\\nAlthough Helnwein\\'s work is rooted in the legacy of German expressionism, he has absorbed elements of American pop culture. In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: \"I learned more from Donald Duck than from all the schools that I have ever attended.\" Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein\\'s work, Julia Pascal wrote in the New Statesman: \"His early watercolor Peinlich (Embarrassing) shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book. Her innocent appeal is destroyed by the gash deforming her cheek and lips. It is as if Donald Duck had met Mengele\".\\nLiving between Los Angeles and Ireland, Helnwein met and photographed the Rolling Stones in London, and his portrait of John F. Kennedy made the cover of Time magazine on the 20th anniversary of the president\\'s assassination. His self-portrait as screaming bandaged man, blinded by forks (1982) became the cover of the Scorpions album Blackout. Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, Burroughs and the German industrial metal band Rammstein posed for him; some of his art-works appeared in the cover-booklet of Michael Jackson\\'s History album. Referring to the fall of the Berlin Wall Helnwein created the book Some Facts about Myself, together with Marlene Dietrich. In 2003 he became friends with Marilyn Manson and started a collaboration with him on the multi-media art-project The Golden Age of Grotesque and on several experimental video-projects. Among his widely published works is a spoof of the famous Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks, entitled Boulevard of Broken Dreams, depicting Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. This painting in turn inspired the song of the same name by Green Day.\\nExamining his imagery from the 1970s to the present, one sees influences as diverse as Bosch, Goya, John Heartfield, Beuys and Mickey Mouse, all filtered through a postwar Viennese childhood. \\'Helnwein\\'s oeuvre embraces total antipodes: The trivial alternates with visions of spiritual doom, the divine in the child contrasts with horror-images of child-abuse. But violence remains to be his basic theme – the physical and the emotional suffering, inflicted by one human being unto another.\\'\\n\\n\\n=== References to the Holocaust ===\\n\\nIn 1988, in remembrance of the Night of the Broken Glass (Kristallnacht), which had happened 50 years earlier, Helnwein erected a large installation in the city center of Cologne, between Museum Ludwig and the Cologne Cathedral: Selektion – Neunter November Nacht (\"Selektion – Ninth November Night). The gallery featured a four-meter-high, hundred-meter-long picture lane in which the artist recalls the events of Reichskristallnacht, often taken to be the beginning of the Holocaust, on November 9 1938. He confronts the passersby with larger-than-life children\\'s faces lined up in a seemingly endless row, as if for concentration camp selection. Just days into the exhibit, these portraits were vandalized by unknown persons, symbolically cutting the throats of the depicted children\\'s faces. Helnwein consciously left the panels with the gashes and included them in the presentation, as he believed that they made the work stronger and more relevant.\\nMitchell Waxman wrote 2004, in The Jewish Journal, Los Angeles: \"The most powerful images that deal with Nazism and Holocaust themes are by Anselm Kiefer and Helnwein, although, Kiefer\\'s work differs considerably from Helnwein\\'s in his concern with the effect of German aggression on the national psyche and the complexities of German cultural heritage. Kiefer is known for evocative and soulful images of barren German landscapes. But Kiefer and Helnwein\\'s work are both informed by the personal experience of growing up in a post-war German speaking country. Burroughs said that the American revolution begins in books and music, and political operatives implement the changes after the fact. To this maybe we can add art. And Helnwein\\'s art might have the capacity to instigate change by piercing the veil of political correctness to recapture the primitive gesture inherent in art.\".\\nOne of the best known paintings of Helnwein\\'s oeuvre is Epiphany I – Adoration of the Magi, (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210 cm x 333 cm, collection of the Denver Art Museum). It is part of a series of three paintings: Epiphany I, Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds), Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple), created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. Julia Pascal wrote about this work in the New Statesman: \"This Austrian Catholic Nativity scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen SS officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary\\'s lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas.\" Helnwein\\'s baby Jesus is often considered to represent Adolf Hitler.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n Helnwein.

              "  \"Francesco Clemente (born 23 March 1952) is an Italian contemporary artist and book publisher. He has lived and worked at various times in Italy, India and New York City. Some of his work is influenced by the traditional art and culture of India. He has worked in various artistic media including drawing, fresco, graphics, mosaic, oils and sculpture. He was among the principal figures in the Italian Transavanguardia movement of the 1980s, which was characterized by a rejection of Formalism and conceptual art and a return to figurative art and Symbolism. He was the co-publisher of Hanuman Books from 1986 to 1993.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nClemente was born in 1952 in Naples, in Campania in southern Italy. In 1970 he enrolled in the faculty of architecture of the Sapienza, the university of Rome, but did not complete a degree there. In Rome he came into contact with contemporary artists such as Luigi Ontani and Alighiero Boetti, who had come to the city at about the same time, and also with the American Cy Twombly, who lived there. Boetti, who was ten years older, became both a friend and a mentor; in 1974 they visited Afghanistan together. With Ontani, Clemente gave performances at the Galleria L'Attico. Despite his close involvement with these artists associated with the Arte povera movement, and his interest in others such as Pino Pascali and Michelangelo Pistoletto, Clemente preferred to work on paper. He made ink drawings of dreams and recollections of his childhood, and in 1971, in his first solo show, exhibited collages at the Galleria Giulia in Rome.\\nIn 1973 Clemente made the first of many visits to India. He established a studio in Madras (now Chennai), and became interested in both the religious and folk traditions of India and in the traditional art and crafts of the country. In 1976 and 1977 he visited the library of the Theosophical Society of Madras to study the religious texts there. In 1980 and 1981 he worked on Francesco Clemente Pinxit, a series of twenty-four gouaches on antique hand-made rag paper, in collaboration with miniature painters from Orissa and Jaipur.:\\u200a88\\u200a In 1982 he moved to New York City.. He lives in Greenwich Village.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nClemente's work has been widely shown. His early large canvases, painted in 1981–1982, were exhibited in 1983 at the Whitechapel Gallery in London and then in Germany and Sweden. In 1986 the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, mounted a travelling exhibition of his work. Clemente participated in the Biennale di Venezia in 1988, 1993, 1995 and 1997; in documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1992 and 1997; and in the Whitney Biennial, also in 1997. Solo shows were held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1990; at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1991;  at the Sezon Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo in 1994; at the Galleria d'Arte Moderna of Bologna in 1999; at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2000; at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli in Naples in 2002–2003; at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin in 2004; at Palazzo Sant'Elia in Palermo Sicily in 2013; at both the Coro della Maddalena in Alba and Santa Maria della Scala in Siena Italy in 2016; and at the NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2017.\\nIn 1998 his work was used in the film Great Expectations, directed by Alfonso Cuarón.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nThe highest selling painting by the artist was The Fourteen Stations, No. XI (1981-1982) who sold by $1,860,000 at Christie's New York, at 9 May 2022.  \\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n265924 Franceclemente (Asteroid)\\nHanuman Books\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\",\n",
              "  'Gordon Matta-Clark (born Gordon Roberto Matta-Echaurren; June 22, 1943 – August 27, 1978) was an American artist best known for site-specific artworks he made in the 1970s.  He was also a pioneer in the field of socially engaged food art.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\n\\nMatta-Clark\\'s parents were artists: Anne Clark, an American artist, and Roberto Matta, a Chilean Surrealist painter, of Basque, French and Spanish descent. He was the godson of Marcel Duchamp\\'s wife, Teeny. His twin brother Sebastian, also an artist, died by suicide in 1976.\\nHe studied architecture at Cornell University from 1962 to 1968, including a year at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he studied French literature. In 1971, he changed his name to Gordon Matta-Clark, adopting his mother\\'s last name. He did not practice as a conventional architect; he worked on what he referred to as \"Anarchitecture\". At the time of Matta-Clark\\'s tenure there, Cornell\\'s architecture program was guided in part by Colin Rowe, a preeminent architectural theorist of modernism.\\nMatta-Clark used a number of media to document his work, including film, video, and photography. His work includes performance and recycling pieces, space and texture works, and his \"building cuts\". He also used puns and other word games as a way to re-conceptualize preconditioned roles and relationships (of everything, from people to architecture). \\nIn February, 1969, the \"Earth Art\" show, curated by Willoughby Sharp at the invitation of Tom Leavitt, was realized at Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art, Cornell University. Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in \"Earth Art\" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition. Sharp then encouraged Gordon Matta-Clark to move to New York City where Sharp continued to introduce him to members of the New York art world. Matta-Clark\\'s work, Museum, at Klaus Kertess\\' Bykert Gallery, was listed and illustrated on pages 4–5 of Avalanche 1, Fall 1970.\\nIn 1971 Matta-Clark, Carol Goodden, and Tina Girouard co-founded FOOD, a restaurant in Manhattan\\'s Soho neighborhood; managed and staffed by artists. The restaurant turned dining into an event with an open kitchen and exotic ingredients that celebrated cooking. The activities at FOOD helped delineate how the art community defined itself in downtown Manhattan. The first of its kind in SoHo, Food became well known among artists and was a central meeting-place for groups such as the Philip Glass Ensemble, Mabou Mines, and the dancers of Grand Union. He ran FOOD until 1973.\\nIn the early 1970s and in the context of his artistic community surrounding FOOD, Matta-Clark developed the idea of \"anarchitecture\" - a conflation of the words anarchy and architecture - to suggest an interest in voids, gaps, and left-over spaces. With his project Fake Estates, Matta-Clark addressed these issues of non-sites by purchasing at auction 15 leftover and unusably small slivers of land in Queens and Staten Island, New York, for $25–$75 a plot. He documented them through photographs, maps, bureaucratic records and deeds, and spoke and wrote about them - but was not able to occupy these residual elements of zoning irregularities in any other way.\\nIn 1974, he performed a literal deconstruction, by removing the facade of a condemned house along the Love Canal, and moving the resulting walls to Artpark, in his work Bingo.\\nFor the Biennale de Paris in 1975, he made the piece titled Conical Intersect by cutting a large cone-shaped hole through two townhouses dating from the 17th century in the market district known as Les Halles which were to be knocked down in order to construct the then-controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.  Also in 1975 he did a similar art intervention named \"Days End, Conical Inversion\" by cutting a round aperture into the structure at Pier 52 on the Hudson River in Manhattan.\\nFor his final major project, Circus or The Caribbean Orange (1978), Matta-Clark made circle cuts in the walls and floors of a townhouse next-door to the first Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, building (237 East Ontario Street), thus altering the space entirely.\\nFollowing his 1978 project, the MCA presented two retrospectives of Matta-Clark\\'s work, in 1985 and in 2008. The 2008 exhibition You Are the Measure included never-before-displayed archival material of his 1978 Chicago project. You Are the Measure traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Death and legacy ==\\nMatta-Clark died from pancreatic cancer on August 27, 1978, aged 35, in New York City. He was survived by his widow, Jane Crawford. The Gordon Matta-Clark Archive is housed at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.\\nIn 2019, his 1974 piece Splitting was cited by The New York Times as one of the 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age.\\n\\n\\n== Videography ==\\nProgram One: Chinatown Voyeur (1971)\\nProgram Two (1971–1972)\\nTree Dance (1971)\\nOpen House (1972)\\nProgram Three (1971–1975)\\nFire Child (1971)\\nFresh Kill (1972)\\nDay\\'s End (1975)\\nFood (1972)\\n Program Five (1972–1976)\\nAutomation House (1972)\\nClockshower (1973)\\nCity Slivers (1976)\\nProgram Four: Sauna View (1973)\\nProgram Six (1974–1976)\\nSplitting (1974)\\nBingo/Ninths (1974)\\nSubstrait (Underground Dailies) (1976)\\nProgram Seven (1974–2005)\\nConical Intersect\" (1975)\\nSous-Sols de Paris (Paris Underground) (1977–2005)\\nThe Wall (1976–2007)\\nProgram Eight: Office Baroque (1977–2005)\\n\\n\\n== Selected books ==\\nOdd Lots: Revisiting Gordon Matta-Clark’s Fake Estates, introduction and interviews by curators Jeffrey Kastner, Sina Najafi, and Frances Richard, Essays by Jeffrey A.

              "  'Frank Helmut Auerbach (born 29 April 1931) is a German-British painter. Born in Germany, he has been a naturalised British subject since 1947. He is considered one of the leading names in the School of London, with fellow artists Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nAuerbach was born in Berlin, the son of Max Auerbach, a patent lawyer, and Charlotte Nora Borchardt, who had trained as an artist. Under the influence of the British writer Iris Origo, his parents sent him to Britain in 1939 under the Kindertransport scheme (although he has stated it was by private arrangement), which brought almost 10,000 mainly Jewish children to Britain to escape from Nazi persecution. Aged seven, Auerbach left Germany via Hamburg on 4 April 1939 and arrived at Southampton on 7 April. His parents stayed behind in Germany, and were killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942.\\nIn Britain, Auerbach became a pupil at Bunce Court School, near Faversham in Kent, where he excelled in not only art but also drama classes. Indeed, he almost became an actor, even taking a small role in Peter Ustinov\\'s play House of Regrets at the Unity Theatre in St Pancras, at the age of 17. But his interest in art proved a stronger draw and he began studying in London, first at St Martin\\'s School of Art from 1948 to 1952, and at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1955. Yet, perhaps the clearest influence on his art training came from a series of additional art classes he took at London\\'s Borough Polytechnic, where he and fellow St Martin\\'s student Leon Kossoff were taught by David Bomberg from 1947 until 1953.\\nFrom 1955, he began teaching in secondary schools, but quickly moved into the visiting tutor circuit at numerous art schools, including Bromley, Sidcup and the Slade School. In particular, he taught one day a week from 1958 to 1965 at Camberwell School of Art. He was the teacher, influence and sponsor of many artists, including Tom Philips, Jenny Saville, Cecily Brown, Peter Saunders and Ray Atkins. For instance, he wrote to Andrew Forge, senior lecturer at the Slade to say that there were some remarkable students that he might consider, particularly Ray Atkins and Jo Keys, obtaining a place for them there.\\nAuerbach\\'s first solo exhibition was at the Beaux Arts Gallery in London in 1956, followed by further solo shows at the Beaux Arts Gallery in 1959, 1961, 1962 and 1963, and then at Marlborough Fine Art in London at regular intervals after 1965; at Marlborough Gallery, New York, in 1969, 1982, 1994, 1998 and 2006; and at Marlborough Graphics in 1990.\\nIn 1978, he was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Hayward Gallery, London, and in 1986 he represented Britain in the Venice Biennale, sharing the biennale\\'s main prize, the Golden Lion, with Sigmar Polke. Further exhibitions have included Eight Figurative Painters, held at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, USA, in 1981, alongside Michael Andrews, Francis Bacon, William Coldstream, Lucian Freud, Patrick George, Leon Kossoff and Euan Uglow; and a retrospective at the Kunstverein, Hamburg, in 1986, comprising paintings and drawings made between 1977 and 1985 originally shown at the 42nd Venice Biennale, also in 1986. This show then toured, with some additional works, to the Museum Folkwang, Essen, and the Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, in 1987. Exhibitions were also held at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in 1989; the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, in 1991; and the National Gallery, London, in 1995. He was included in the exhibition A New Spirit in Painting at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1981 and a solo exhibition of his paintings and drawings 1954 to 2001 was held there in 2001; and held a solo show entitled Frank Auerbach Etchings and Drypoints 1954–2006 at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, which toured to the Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal, during 2007–08; and another solo show at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, in 2009.\\nAuerbach was the subject of a television film entitled Frank Auerbach: To the Studio (2001), directed by Hannah Rothschild and produced by Jake Auerbach (Jake Auerbach Films Ltd). This was first broadcast on the arts programme Omnibus on 10 November 2001.\\nDavid Bowie bought and owned Auerbach\\'s \"Head of Gerda Boehm\" as part of his private collection. After Bowie\\'s death in 2016, this piece was among many put up for auction in November 2016, where it was sold for £3.8 million (US$4.7 million).\\nLondon\\'s Tate Britain, in association with the Kunstmuseum Bonn, organized a major retrospective of Auerbach\\'s work in 2015 and 2016. The exhibit was curated by Catherine Lampert together with the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Style and influences ==\\nAuerbach is a figurative painter, who focuses on portraits and city scenes in and around the area of London in which he lives, Camden Town. Although sometimes described as expressionistic, Auerbach is not an expressionist painter. His work is not concerned with finding a visual equivalent to an emotional or spiritual state that characterised the expressionist movement, rather it deals with the attempt to resolve the experience of being in the world in paint. In this the experience of the world is seen as essentially chaotic with the role of the artist being to impose an order upon that chaos and record that order in the painting. This ambition with the paintings results in Auerbach developing intense relationships with particular subjects, particularly the people he paints, but also the location of his cityscape subjects. Speaking on this in 2001 he stated: \"If you pass something every day and it has a little character, it begins to intrigue you.\" This simple statement belies the intensity of the relationship that develops between Auerbach and his subjects, which results in an astonishing desire to produce an image the artist considers \\'right\\'. This leads Auerbach to paint an image and then scrape it off the canvas at the end of each day, repeating this process time and again, not primarily to create a layering of images but because of a sense of dissatisfaction with the image leading him to try to paint it again.\\nThis also indicates that the thick paint in Auerbach\\'s work, which led to some of Auerbach\\'s paintings in the 1950s being considered difficult to hang, partly due to their weight and according to some newspaper reports in case the paint fell off, is not primarily the result of building up a lot of paint over time. It is in fact applied in a very short space of time, and may well be scraped off very soon after application. This technique has not always been considered positively, with the Manchester Guardian newspaper commenting in 1956 that: \"The technique is so fantastically obtrusive that it is some time before one penetrates to the intentions that should justify this grotesque method.\"\\nThis intensity of approach and handling has also not always sat well with the art world that developed in Britain from the late 1980s onwards, with one critic at that time, Stuart Morgan, denouncing Auerbach for espousing \"conservatism as if it were a religion\" on the basis that he applies paint without a sense of irony.\\nAs well as painting street scenes close to his London home, Auerbach tends to paint a small number of people repeatedly, including Estella Olive West (indicated in painting titles as EOW), Juliet Yardley Mills (or JYM) and Auerbach\\'s wife Julia Auerbach (née Wolstenholme). He has been painting art historian and curator Catherine Lampert regularly since  1978 when she organized his retrospective at the Hayward Gallery. Again, a similar obsession with specific subjects, and a desire to return to them to \"try again\" is discernable in this use of the same models.\\nA strong emphasis in Auerbach\\'s work is its relationship to the history of art. Showing at the National Gallery in London in 1994, he made direct reference to the gallery\\'s collection of paintings by Rembrandt, Titian and Rubens. Unlike the National Gallery\\'s Associate Artist Scheme, however, Auerbach\\'s work after historic artists was not the result of a short residency at the National Gallery, it has a long history, and in this exhibition he showed paintings made after Titian\\'s Bacchus and Ariadne, from the 1970s, to Rubens\\' Samson and Delilah, made in 1993.\\nAuerbach\\'s personal history, and his painting style, are the basis for the character \"Max Ferber\" in W. G. Sebald\\'s award-winning collection of narratives The Emigrants (1992 in Germany, 1996 in Britain).\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nFrank Auerbach, T.J.

              "  'Sir Grayson Perry  (born 24 March 1960) is an English contemporary artist, writer and broadcaster. He is known for his ceramic vases, tapestries, and cross-dressing, as well as his observations of the contemporary arts scene, and for dissecting British \"prejudices, fashions and foibles\".\\nPerry\\'s vases have classical forms and are decorated in bright colours, depicting subjects at odds with their attractive appearance. There is a strong autobiographical element in his work, in which images of Perry as \"Claire\", his female alter-ego, and \"Alan Measles\", his childhood teddy bear, often appear. He has made a number of documentary television programmes and has curated exhibitions. He has published two autobiographies, Grayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl (2007) and The Descent of Man (2016), written and illustrated a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence (2012), written a book about art, Playing to the Gallery (2014), and published his illustrated Sketchbooks (2016). Various books describing his work have been published. In 2013 he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures.\\nPerry has had solo exhibitions at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. His work is held in the permanent collections of \\nthe British Council and Arts Council, Crafts Council, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\\nPerry was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003. He was interviewed about the win and resulting press in Sarah Thornton\\'s Seven Days in the Art World. In 2008 he was ranked number 32 in The Daily Telegraph\\'s list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". In 2012, Perry was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles\\' Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nBorn into a working-class family, Perry was four years old when his father, Tom, left home after discovering his mother, Jean, was having an affair with a milkman, whom she later married and who Perry has claimed was violent. Subsequently, he spent an unhappy childhood moving between his parents and created a fantasy world based around his teddy in order to cope with his sense of anxiety. He considers that a person\\'s early experiences are important in shaping their aesthetic and sexuality. Perry describes his first sexual experience at the age of seven when he tied himself up in his pyjamas.\\nPerry spent a short period of his school life at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford (KEGS). Following the encouragement of his art teacher, he decided to study art. He did an art foundation course at Braintree College of Further Education from 1978 to 1979, followed by a BA in fine art at Portsmouth College of Art and Design (now the University of Portsmouth), graduating in 1982. He had an interest in film and exhibited his first piece of pottery at a New Contemporaries show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1980. In the months following his graduation he joined The Neo Naturists, a group started by Christine Binnie to revive the \"true sixties spirit – which involves living one\\'s life more or less naked and occasionally manifesting it into a performance for which the main theme is body paint\". They put on events at galleries and other venues. In this time Perry was living in squats in central London.\\nWhen he left for Portsmouth in 1979, his stepfather told him \"Don\\'t come back\". Perry was estranged from his mother; when she died in 2016, he did not attend her funeral.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\nAs of 2010 he lives in north London with his wife, the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. They have one daughter, Florence, born in 1992.\\nIn 2015 he was appointed to succeed Kwame Kwei-Armah as chancellor of University of the Arts London.\\nPerry is a keen mountain biker and motorcyclist.\\nPerry is a supporter of the Labour Party, and has designed works of art to raise funds for the party. In September 2015, Perry endorsed Jeremy Corbyn\\'s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Perry said he would back Corbyn as he was \"doing something interesting for the political debate.\" He added: \"I think he\\'s gold.\" In October 2016, he said that Jeremy Corbyn had \"no chance of winning an election\".\\n\\n\\n==== Cross-dressing ====\\nFrom an early age he liked to dress in stereotypically women\\'s clothes and in his teens realised that he was a transvestite. At the age of 15, he moved in with his father\\'s family in Chelmsford, where he began to go out dressed as a woman. When he was discovered by his father, he said he would stop but his stepmother told everyone about it, and a few months later, threw him out. He returned to his mother and stepfather at Great Bardfield in Essex.\\n\\nPerry frequently appears in public dressed as a woman, and he has described his female alter-ego, \"Claire\", variously as \"a 19th century reforming matriarch, a middle-England protester for No More Art, an aero-model-maker, or an Eastern European Freedom Fighter\", and \"a fortysomething woman living in a Barratt home, the kind of woman who eats ready meals and can just about sew on a button\". In his work Perry includes pictures of himself in stereotypically women\\'s clothes: for example Mother of All Battles (1996) is a photograph of Claire holding a gun and wearing a dress, in ethnic eastern European style, embroidered with images of war, exhibited at his 2002 Guerrilla Tactics show. One critic has called Perry \"The social critic from hell\".\\nPerry has designed many of Claire\\'s outfits but fashion students at Central Saint Martins art college in London take part in an annual competition to design new dresses for Claire. An exhibition, Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry\\'s Dresses, was held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, from November 2017 to February 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nAs well as pottery, Perry has worked in printmaking, drawing, embroidery and other textile work, film and performance. He has written a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence. Perry often works with media such as ceramics and weaving, traditionally considered to be lower down the hierarchy of arts than sculpture and painting. \\n\\n\\n=== Ceramics ===\\nThe Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam mounted a solo exhibition of his work in 2002, Guerrilla Tactics. It was partly for this work that he was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003, the first time it was given to a ceramic artist.\\nPerry\\'s work refers to several ceramic traditions, including Greek pottery and folk art. He has said, \"I like the whole iconography of pottery. It hasn\\'t got any big pretensions to being great public works of art, and no matter how brash a statement I make, on a pot it will always have certain humility ... [F]or me the shape has to be classical invisible: then you\\'ve got a base that people can understand\". His vessels are made by coiling, a traditional method. Most have a complex surface employing many techniques, including \"glazing, incision, embossing, and the use of photographic transfers\", which requires several firings. To some he adds sprigs, little relief sculptures stuck to the surface. The high degree of skill required by his ceramics and their complexity distances them from craft pottery. It has been said that these methods are not used for decorative effect but to give meaning. Perry challenges the idea, implicit in the craft tradition, that pottery is merely decorative or utilitarian and cannot express ideas.\\nIn his work Perry reflects upon his upbringing as a boy, his stepfather\\'s anger and the absence of proper guidance about male conduct. Perry\\'s understanding of the roles in his family is portrayed in Using My Family, from 1998, where a teddy bear provides affection, and the contemporaneous The Guardians, which depicts his mother and stepfather.\\nMuch of Perry\\'s work contains sexually explicit content. Some of his sexual imagery has been described as \"obscene sadomasochistic sex scenes\". He also has a reputation for depicting child abuse and yet there are no works depicting sexual child abuse although We\\'ve Found the Body of your Child, 2000 hints at emotional child abuse and child neglect. In other work he juxtaposes decorative clichés like flowers with weapons and war. Perry combines various techniques as a \"guerrilla tactic\", using the approachable medium of pottery to provoke thought.\\n\\n\\n=== Tapestries ===\\n\\nPerry created the 15m x 3m The Walthamstow Tapestry in 2009. The large woven tapestry bears hundreds of brand names surrounding large figures in the stages of life from birth to death.\\nPerry\\'s 2012 TV documentary series All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry, about class \"taste\" variables, included him making large tapestries, called The Vanity of Small Differences. Their format was inspired by William Hogarth\\'s A Rake\\'s Progress. Of the tapestries, Perry says, \\n\\nThe Vanity of Small Differences consists of six tapestries that tell the story of Tim Rakewell. Some of the characters, incidents and objects I have included I encountered whilst filming All in the Best Possible Taste. The tapestries tell a story of class mobility. I think nothing has such a strong influence on our aesthetic taste as the social class we grow up in.\\nThe sketches were translated using Adobe Photoshop to design the finished images and the tapestries were woven on a computer controlled loom.\\nPerry produced a pair of large-scale tapestries for A House for Essex, called The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope in 2015.\\n\\n\\n=== A House for Essex (\"Julie\\'s House\") (2012–2015) ===\\n\\nIn 2015 the external work was completed on a holiday home in Wrabness, Essex, created by Perry working with Fashion Architecture Taste (FAT). Known as A House for Essex or Julie\\'s House, it was built over the River Stour, as a commission for the charity Living Architecture. The house encapsulates the story of Julie May Cope, a fictional Essex woman, \"born in a flood-struck Canvey Island in 1953 and mown down last year by a curry delivery driver in Colchester\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ellis Woodman said, \"Sporting a livery of green and white ceramic tiles, telephone-box red joinery and a gold roof, it is not easy to miss. ... Decoration is everywhere: from the external tiles embossed with motifs referencing Julie\\'s rock-chick youth to extravagant tapestries recording her life\\'s full narrative. Perry has contributed ceramic sculptures, modelled on Irish Sheelanagigs, which celebrate her as a kind of latter-day earth mother while the delivery driver\\'s moped has even been repurposed as a chandelier suspended above the double-height living room.\"\\nPerry made a variety of artwork used inside the house, depicting Julie Cope\\'s life. He made a series of large-scale tapestries, The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope, which include \"A Perfect Match\" (2015) and \"In Its Familiarity, Golden\" (2015), and for the bedrooms, \"Julie and Rob\" (2013) and \"Julie and Dave\" (2015). He also wrote an essay, \"The Ballad of Julie Cope\" (2015) and created a series of black and white woodcuts, Six Snapshots of Julie (2015).  Perry also released the series in a signed colour edition of 68. The work was shown in an exhibition, Grayson Perry: The Life of Julie Cope, at Firstsite in Colchester, Essex, from January to February 2018.\\n\\n\\n== Media ==\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nIn 2005, Perry presented a Channel 4 documentary, Why Men Wear Frocks, in which he examined transvestism and masculinity at the start of the 21st century. Perry talked about his own life as a transvestite and the effect it had on him and his family, frankly discussing its difficulties and pleasures. The documentary won a Royal Television Society award for best network production.\\nHe was the subject of a The South Bank Show episode in 2006 and the subject of an Imagine documentary broadcast in November 2011.\\nHis three-part series for Channel 4, All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry, was broadcast in June 2012. The series analysed the ideas of taste held by the different social classes of the UK. Perry explores both male and female culture in each social class and what they buy, in three parts: \"Working Class Taste,\" \"Middle Class Taste,\" and \"Upper Class Taste.\" At the same time, he photographs, then illustrates his experiences and the people, transcribing them into large tapestries, entitled The Vanity of Small Differences.\\nIn 2014, Perry presented a three-part documentary series for Channel 4, Who Are You?, on identity. In it he creates diverse portraits for the National Portrait Gallery, London, of ex-MP Chris Huhne, Rylan Clark-Neal from The X Factor, a Muslim convert and a young transgender man.\\nIn 2016, he presented a series exploring masculinity for Channel 4, Grayson Perry: All Man.\\nIn 2018, Perry explored Rites of Passage in a four-part documentary series on Channel 4. The documentary series focused on death, marriage, birth, and coming of age as Perry compared the way people in the UK dealt with these themes compared to others around the world. Each episode culminated in Perry helping those in the UK to create ceremonies that were appropriate to their own situations.\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Perry presented Grayson\\'s Art Club from his home studio alongside his wife Philippa, encouraging viewers to produce and share their own artworks from lockdown. Along with pieces submitted by practising artists and celebrity guests, the public\\'s work went on display at an exhibition in Manchester, however, this did not go ahead due to COVID-19 restrictions. The programme\\'s second series began in February 2021.\\nIn 2020 Channel 4 broadcast the series Grayson Perry\\'s Big American Road Trip. Perry crossed the US on a motorbike, exploring its biggest fault lines, from race to class and identity. As America headed for a presidential election, Perry asked how its growing divisions could be overcome.\\nOther television and radio appearances also include the BBC\\'s Question Time, HARDTalk, Desert Island Discs, Have I Got News for You and QI.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing and lectures ===\\nPerry was an arts correspondent for The Times, writing a weekly column until October 2007.\\nPerry gave the 2013 BBC Reith Lectures. In a series of talks titled Playing to the Gallery, he considered the state of art in the 21st century. The individual lectures, titled \"Democracy Has Bad Taste\", \"Beating the Bounds\", \"Nice Rebellion, Welcome In!\" and \"I Found Myself in the Art World\", were broadcast in October and November 2013 on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service. He expanded the lectures into a book, Playing to the Gallery: Helping Contemporary Art in its Struggle to Be Understood (2014).\\nHe guest edited an issue of New Statesman in 2014, entitled \"The Great White Male Issue\".\\nIn 2017 Perry gave the inaugural Orwell Lecture in the North for The Orwell Foundation, entitled \"I\\'ve read all the academic texts on empathy\".\\n\\n\\n=== Judging ===\\nIn 2007 Perry curated an exhibition of art by prisoners and ex-offenders entitled Insider Art at the Institute of Contemporary Arts presented by the Koestler Trust, a charity which promotes art as rehabilitation in prisons, young offenders institutions and secure psychiatric units. He described the art works as \"raw and all the more powerful for that\". In 2011 he returned to the annual Koestler Trust exhibition, this time held at London\\'s Southbank Centre and judged the award winners in Art by Offenders with Will Self and Emma Bridgewater.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Publications by Perry ===\\nGrayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl.

              "  'Jeffrey Lynn Koons (; born January 21, 1955) is an American artist recognized for his work dealing with popular culture and his sculptures depicting everyday objects, including balloon animals produced in stainless steel with mirror-finish surfaces. He lives and works in both New York City and his hometown of York, Pennsylvania. His works have sold for substantial sums, including at least two record auction prices for a work by a living artist: US$58.4 million for Balloon Dog (Orange) in 2013 and US$91.1 million for Rabbit in 2019.\\nCritics come sharply divided in their views of Koons. Some view his work as pioneering and of major art-historical importance. Others dismiss his work as kitsch, crass, and based on cynical self-merchandising. Koons has stated that there are no hidden meanings or critiques in his works.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nKoons was born in York, Pennsylvania, to Henry and Gloria Koons. His father was a furniture dealer and interior decorator. His mother was a seamstress. When he was nine years old, his father would place old master paintings that Koons copied and signed in the window of his shop in an attempt to attract visitors. As a child he went door-to-door after school selling gift-wrapping paper and candy to earn pocket money. As a teenager he revered Salvador Dalí so much that he visited him at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City.\\nKoons studied painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While a student at the Art Institute, Koons met the artist Ed Paschke, who became a major influence and for whom Koons worked as a studio assistant in the late 1970s. He lived in Lakeview, and then in the Pilsen neighborhood at Halsted Street and 19th Street.\\nAfter college, Koons moved to New York in 1977 and worked at the membership desk of the Museum of Modern Art while establishing himself as an artist. During this time, he dyed his hair red and often wore a pencil mustache, after Salvador Dalí. In 1980, he became licensed to sell mutual funds and stocks and began working as a Wall Street commodities broker at First Investors Corporation. After a summer with his parents in Sarasota, Florida, where he briefly worked as a political canvasser, Koons returned to New York and found a new career as a commodities broker, first at Clayton Brokerage Company and then at Smith Barney.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nFollowing his graduation from the Art Institute in Chicago in 1976, Koons made his way to New York City. There, he moved away from creating representations of his personal fantasies and began to explore objective art, commerce, and politics.He rose to prominence in the mid-1980s as part of a generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a newly media-saturated era with his Pre-new The New series. With recognition came the establishment of a factory-like studio located in a loft at the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York in SoHo. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his work—in a similar mode as Andy Warhol\\'s Factory. Koons\\'s work is produced using a method known as art fabrication. Until 2019, Koons had a 1,500 m2 (16,000 sq ft) studio factory near the old Hudson rail yards in Chelsea employing 90 to 120 assistants to produce his work. More recently, Koons has downsized staffing and shifted to more automated forms of production and relocated to a much smaller studio space. He now uses technology to create his artistic references on computers and color-corrects them until he is satisfied with the results. To ensure consistency, Koons implemented a color-by-numbers system, so that each of his assistants could execute his canvases and sculptures as if they had been done \"by a single hand\". Throughout his career, he has consistently explored themes such as consumerist behavior, seduction, banality, and childhood, among others. \\n\\n\\n=== Early Works and Inflatables ===\\nJeff Koons first began experimenting with the use of ready-made objects and modes of display in his apartment in 1976. His fascination with the extravagant world of luxurious goods and their more affordable counterparts led him to collect items like toys, metallic finishes, leopard skin, and porcelain.  Between 1977 and 1979 Koons produced four separate artworks, which he later referred to as Early Works. In 1978 he began working on his Inflatables series, consisting of inflatable flowers and a rabbit of various heights and colors, positioned along with mirrors. Koons drew inspiration from Robert Smithson\\'s emphasis on display and connected his work to his father\\'s furniture store displays. He documented his work through photography, using it as a means of exploring different installation techniques. \\n\\n\\n=== The Pre-New, The New, and Equilibrium series ===\\nSince 1979 Koons has produced work within series. His early work was in the form of conceptual sculpture, an example of which is The Pre-New, a series of domestic objects attached to light fixtures, resulting in strange new configurations. Another example is The New, a series of vacuum-cleaners, often selected for brand names that appealed to the artist like the iconic Hoover, which he had mounted in illuminated Perspex boxes. Koons first exhibited these pieces in the window of the New Museum in New York in 1980. He chose a limited combination of vacuum cleaners and arranged them in cabinets accordingly, juxtaposing the verticality of the upright cleaners with the squat cylinders of the \"Shelton Wet/Dry drum\" cleaners. At the museum, the machines were displayed as if in a showroom, and oriented around a central red fluorescent lightbox with just the words \"The New\" written on it as if it were announcing some new concept or marketing brand. They were shown again in a major solo show at Jeff Koons: The New Encased Works at Daniel Weinberg Gallery in 1987.\\nAnother example for Koons\\' early work is The Equilibrium Series (1983), consisting of one to three basketballs floating in distilled water, a project the artist had researched with the help of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Total Equilibrium Tanks are completely filled with distilled water and a small amount of ordinary salt, to assist the hollow balls in remaining suspended in the centre of the liquid. In a second version, the 50/50 Tanks, only half the tank is filled with distilled water, with the result that the balls float half in and half out of the water. In addition, Koons conceived and fabricated five unique works for the Encased series (1983–1993/98), sculptures consisting of stacked sporting balls (four rows of six basketballs each, and one row of six soccer balls) with their original cardboard packaging in glass display case. Also part of the Equilibrium series are posters featuring basketball stars in Nike advertisements and 10 bronze objects, representing lifesaving gear.\\n\\n\\n=== Statuary series ===\\nIn 1986, Jeff Koons introduced the Statuary series, featuring ten pieces that reimagined his earlier inflatable series from the 1970s. The series aimed to illustrate how art often mirrors self-perception and evolves into decorative expression by presenting a panoramic view of society. The sculptures drew inspiration from historical figures like Louis XIV and Bob Hope, as well as other art historical themes and sources. Through Statuary, Koons redirected his artistic focus toward the concept of artistic taste and the societal role of art. He incorporated some readymade objects, including the inflatable rabbit, and transformed them into highly polished stainless-steel pieces. This led to the creation of one of his most iconic works, Rabbit (1986).\\nThere are three identical versions of Rabbit. One version was previously part of art collector Stephan Edlis\\'s personal collection, but it now resides as a gift at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and another in The Broad Museum in Los Angeles. In May 15, 2019, Jeff Koons set a record for most expensive piece sold by a living artist, for the sale of \"Rabbit\". The third version of the piece was sold at Christie\\'s Auction House for US$80 million which. After including auctioneer\\'s fees, the final sale price of \"Rabbit\" was US$91,075,000.\\nThe Rabbit has since returned to its original soft form, and many times larger at more than 50 feet high, taken to the air. On October 15, 2009, the giant metallic monochrome color rabbit used during the 2007 Macy\\'s Thanksgiving day parade was put on display for Nuit Blanche in the Eaton Centre in Toronto. The other objects of the series combine objects Koons found in souvenir shops and baroque imagery, thereby playing with the distinction between low art and high art.\\n\\n\\n=== Luxury and Degradation series and Kiepenkerl ===\\nFirst shown in Koons\\' eponymous exhibitions at the short-lived International With Monument Gallery, New York, and at Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, in 1986, the Luxury and Degradation series is a group of works thematically centered on alcohol. This group included a stainless steel travel cocktail cabinet, a Baccarat crystal decanter and other hand-made renderings of alcohol-related paraphernalia, as well as reprinted and framed ads for drinks such as Gordon\\'s Gin (\"I Could Go for Something Gordon\\'s\"), Hennessy (\"Hennessy, The Civilized Way to Lay Down the Law\"), Bacardi (\"Aquí... el gran sabor del ron Bacardi\"), Dewars (\"The Empire State of Scotch\"), Martell (\"I Assume You Drink Martell\") and Frangelico (\"Stay in Tonight\" and \"Find a Quiet Table\") in seductively intensified colors on canvas Koons appropriated these advertisements and revalued them by recontextualizing them into artworks. They \"deliver a critique of traditional advertising that supports Baudrillard\\'s censorious view of the obscene promiscuity of consumer signs\". Another work, Jim Beam – J.B. Turner Engine (1986), is based on a commemorative, collectible in bottle in the form of a locomotive that was created by Jim Beam; however, Koons appropriated this model and had it cast in gleaming stainless-steel. The train model cast in steel titled Jim Beam – Baggage Car (1986) even contains Jim Beam bourbon. With the Luxury and Degradation series Koons interfered into the realms of the social. He created an artificial and gleaming surface which represented a proletarian luxury. It was interpreted as seduction by simulation because it was fake luxury. Being the producer of this deception brought him to a kind of leadership, as he commented himself.\\nThe same material of stainless steel was used for the statue of Kiepenkerl. After being rebuilt in the 1950s, the figure of the itinerant trader was replaced by Jeff Koons in 1987 for the decennial Skulptur Projekte exhibition. Standing on a central square in Münster, the statue retained a certain cultural power as a nostalgic symbol of the past. During the production process, the foundry where the piece was being made wanted to knock the ceramic shell off too soon, which resulted in the piece being bent and deformed. Koons decided to bring in a specialist and give the piece \"radical plastic surgery.\" After this experience he felt liberated: \"I was now free to work with objects that did not necessarily pre-exist. I could create models.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Banality series ===\\n\\nKoons then moved on to the Banality series. For this project he engaged workshops in Germany and Italy that had a long tradition of working in ceramic, porcelain, and wood. The series culminated in 1988 with Michael Jackson and Bubbles, a series of three life-size gold-leaf plated porcelain statues of the sitting singer cuddling Bubbles, his pet chimpanzee. Three years later, one of these sold at Sotheby\\'s New York for US$5.6 million. Two of these sculptures are now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) in downtown Los Angeles. The statue was included in a 2004 retrospective at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo which traveled a year later to the Helsinki City Art Museum. It also featured in his second retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 2008. The statue is currently back at the newly opened Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art at Tjuvholmen in Oslo. Recently, his work Christ and the Lamb (1988) has been analyzed as an acknowledgment and critique of the spiritual and meditative power of the Rococo.\\nAnticipating a less than generous critical response to his 1988 Banality series exhibition, with all of his new objects made in an edition of three, allowing for simultaneous, identical shows at galleries in New York, Cologne, and Chicago, Koons devised the Art Magazine Ads series (1988–1989). Placed in Artforum, Art in America, Flash Art, and Art News, the ads were designed as promotions for his own gallery exhibitions. Koons also issued Signature Plate, an edition for Parkett magazine, with a photographic decal in colors on a porcelain plate with gold-plated rim. Arts journalist Arifa Akbar reported for The Independent that in \"an era when artists were not regarded as \\'stars\\', Koons went to great lengths to cultivate his public persona by employing an image consultant\". Featuring photographs by Matt Chedgey, Koons placed \"advertisements in international art magazines of himself surrounded by the trappings of success\" and gave interviews \"referring to himself in the third person\".\\n\\n\\n=== Made in Heaven series ===\\nIn 1989, the Whitney Museum and its guest curator Marvin Heiferman asked Koons to make an artwork about the media on a billboard for the show \"Image World: Art and Media Culture\". The billboard was meant as an advertisement for an unmade movie, entitled Made in Heaven. Koons employed his then-wife Ilona Staller (\"Cicciolina\") as a model in the shoot that formed the basis of the resulting work for the Whitney, Made in Heaven (1990–1991). Including works with such titles as Dirty Ejaculation and Ilonaʼs Asshole, the series of enormous grainy photographs printed on canvas, glassworks, and sculptures portrayed Koons and Staller in highly explicit sexual positions and created considerable controversy. The paintings of the series reference art from the Baroque and Rococo periods—among others, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher—and also draw upon the breakthroughs of early modern painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet.\\nThe series was first shown at the 1990 Venice Biennale. Koons reportedly destroyed much of the work when Staller took their son Ludwig with her to Italy. In celebration of Made in Heaven\\'s 20th anniversary, Luxembourg & Dayan chose to present a redux edition of the series. The Whitney Museum also exhibited several of the photographs on canvas in their 2014 retrospective.\\n\\n\\n=== Puppy ===\\n\\nKoons was not among the 44 American artists selected to exhibit their work in Documenta 9 in 1992, but was commissioned by three art dealers to create a piece for nearby Arolsen Castle in Bad Arolsen, Germany. The result was Puppy, a 43 ft (13 m) tall topiary sculpture of a West Highland White Terrier puppy, executed in a variety of flowers (including Marigolds, Begonias, Impatiens, Petunias, and Lobelias) on a transparent color-coated chrome stainless steel substructure. The self-cleaning flowers would grow for the specific length of time that the piece was exhibited. The size and location of Puppy -the courtyard of a baroque palace- acknowledged the mass audience. After the outbreak that followed his Made in Heaven series, Koons decided to make \"an image that communicated warmth and love to people.\" \\nIn 1995, in a co-venture between Museum of Contemporary Art, Kaldor Public Art Projects and Sydney Festival, the sculpture was dismantled and re-erected at the Museum of Contemporary Art on Sydney Harbour on a new, more permanent, stainless steel armature with an internal irrigation system. While the Arolsen Puppy had 20,000 plants, the Sydney version held around 60,000.\\nThe piece was purchased in 1997 by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and installed on the terrace outside the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. Before the dedication at the museum, an Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) trio disguised as gardeners attempted to plant explosive-filled flowerpots near the sculpture, but was foiled by Basque police officer Jose María Aguirre, who then was shot dead by ETA members. Currently the square in which the statue is placed bears the name of Aguirre. In the summer of 2000, the statue traveled to New York City for a temporary exhibition at Rockefeller Center.\\nMedia mogul Peter Brant and his wife, model Stephanie Seymour, commissioned Koons to create a duplicate of the Bilbao statue Puppy (1993) for their Connecticut estate, the Brant Foundation Art Study Center. In 1998, a miniature version of Puppy was released as a white glazed porcelain vase, in an edition of 3000.\\n\\n\\n=== Celebration series ===\\n\\nKoons\\' Celebration was to honor the ardently hoped-for return of Ludwig from Rome  . Consisting of a series of large-scale sculptures and paintings of balloon dogs, Valentine hearts, diamonds, and Easter eggs, was conceived in 1994. Some of the pieces are still being fabricated. Each of the 20 different sculptures in the series comes in five differently colored \"unique versions\", including the artist\\'s cracked Egg (Blue) won the 2008 Charles Wollaston Award for the most distinguished work in the Royal Academy\\'s Summer Exhibition. The Diamond pieces were created between 1994 and 2005, made of shiny stainless steel seven-feet wide. Created in an edition of five versions, his later work Tulips (1995–2004) consists of a bouquet of multicolor balloon flowers blown up to gargantuan proportions (more than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall and 5 m (16 ft) across). Koons finally started to work on Balloon Flower in 1995.\\nKoons was pushing to finish the series in time for a 1996 exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, but the show was ultimately canceled because of production delays and cost overruns. When \"Celebration\" funding ran out, the staff was laid off, leaving a skeleton crew of two: Gary McCraw, Koons\\' studio manager, who had been with him since 1990, and Justine Wheeler, an artist from South Africa, who had arrived in 1995 and eventually took charge of the sculpture operation. The artist convinced his primary collectors Dakis Joannou, Peter Brant, and Eli Broad, along with dealers Jeffrey Deitch, Anthony d\\'Offay, and Max Hetzler, to invest heavily in the costly fabrication of the Celebration series at Southern California-based Carlson & Company (including his Balloon Dog and Moon series), and later, at Arnold, a Frankfurt-based company. The dealers funded the project in part by selling works to collectors before they were fabricated. In 1999, his 1988 \"Pink Panther\" sculpture sold at auction for US$1.8 million, and he returned to the Sonnabend gallery. Well aware of Koons\\' needs and demands, Ileana Sonnabend and Antonio Homem, her gallery director and adopted son, nevertheless welcomed him back; in all likelihood they sensed (correctly, it turned out) that he was poised for a glorious second act—something that only he, among his generation of overpublicized artists, has so far managed to pull off. Koons, however, no longer confines himself to a single gallery. Larry Gagosian, the colossus of New York dealers, agreed to finance the completion of all the unfinished \"Celebration\" work, in exchange for exclusive rights to sell it.\\nIn 2006, Koons presented Hanging Heart, a 9-foot-tall highly polished, steel heart, one of a series of five differently colored examples, part of his Celebration series. Large sculptures from that series were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2008. Later additions to the series include Balloon Swan (2004–2011), an 11.5-foot (3.5-meter), stainless-steel bird, Balloon Rabbit (2005–2010), and Balloon Monkey, all for which children\\'s party favors are reconceived as mesmerizing monumental forms.\\nThe series also includes, in addition to sculptures, sixteen oil paintings.\\n\\n\\n=== Easyfun and Easyfun-Ethereal ===\\n\\nCommissioned by the Deutsche Guggenheim in 1999, Koons created the first seven paintings of the new series, Easyfun, comprising paintings and wall-mounted sculptures. In 2001, Koons undertook a series of paintings, Easyfun-Ethereal, using a collage approach that combined bikinis, food, and landscapes painted under his supervision by assistants. The series eventually expanded to twenty-four paintings.\\n\\n\\n=== Split-Rocker ===\\nIn 2000, Koons designed Split-Rocker, his second floral sculpture made of stainless steel, soil, geotextile fabric, and an internal irrigation system, which was first shown at the Palais des Papes in Avignon, France. Like Puppy, it is covered with around 27,000 live flowers, including petunias, begonias, impatiens, geraniums and marigolds. Weighing 150 tons and soaring over 37 feet high, Split-Rocker is composed of two halves: one based on a toy pony of one of Koons\\' sons, the other based on a toy dinosaur. Together, they form the head of a giant child\\'s rocker. Koons produced just two editions of the sculpture. As of 2014, he owns one of them; the other is displayed at Glenstone in Maryland. At Glenstone, Split-Rocker is in bloom from mid-May to mid-October, and requires daily caretaking during that period. In summer 2014 Split-Rocker was installed at Rockefeller Plaza in New York City for several months in coincidence with the opening of Koons\\' retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Popeye and Hulk Elvis series ===\\nPaintings and sculptures from the Popeye series, which Koons began in 2002, feature the cartoon figures of Popeye and Olive Oyl. One such item is a stainless steel reproduction of a mass-market PVC Popeye figurine. The artist will also make use of inflatable animals again, this time in combination with ladders, trashcans and fences. To create these sculptures, the toys get a layer of coating after finding the right shape. Then a hard copy is made and sent to the foundry to be cast in aluminium. Back in the studio the sculptures are painted in order to achieve the shiny look of the original inflatables. For these surrealist installations, Acrobat in particular, Koons got inspiration from the Chicago Imagist H.C. Westermann. The Popeye sculpture was purchased by billionaire Steve Wynn for $28 million and it is displayed outside the casino entrance at Wynn\\'s Encore Boston Harbor hotel and casino property.\\nHulk Elvis is a work series by Koons created between 2004 and 2014. The works range from precision-machined bronze sculptures—inspired by an inflatable of the popular comic book hero and extruded in three dimensions—to large-scale oil paintings. The work series\\' title combines the popular comic book hero Hulk with the pop icon Elvis. The triple image of the Hulk figure recalls Andy Warhol\\'s silk-screen printing Triple Elvis (1963), regarding both the multiplication and the posture of the Hulk figure.\\nAccording to the artist, the Hulk Elvis series with its strong, heroic image of the Hulk represents \"a very high-testosterone body of work\". Koons also perceives the series as \"a bridge between East and West\", since a parallel might be drawn between the comic book hero Hulk and Asian guardian Gods.\\nThe three-dimensional works Hulk (Friends) and Hulks (Bell) (both 2004–2012) feature apparently inflatable Incredible Hulks that actually weigh almost a ton each and are made of bronze and wood. The sculpture Hulk (Organ) (2004–2014) includes a fully functional musical instrument whose potential deep sounds match the figure\\'s powerful and masculine appearance.\\nThe series\\' paintings are collages made of several photoshop layers. The images range from abstract landscapes to elements of American iconography (trains, horses, carriages) and comprise characters such as the Hulk or an inflatable plastic monkey. The landscape paintings often have explicit or implicit sexual content. For example, a recurrent crude line drawing of a vulva refers to Courbet\\'s L\\'Origine du monde (1866).\\nThe Hulk Elvis series has been exhibited at a number of international art venues such as the Gagosian Gallery in London (2007), the Gagosian Gallery in Hong Kong, China (2014) and the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, Austria (2015).\\n\\n\\n=== Antiquity series ===\\nIn 2008, Jeff Koons started working on his Antiquity series, delving into themes of the portrayal of eros, fertility, and feminine beauty across the history of art. At the center of each scene in the Antiquity paintings (2009–2013) is a famous ancient or classical sculpture, meticulously rendered in oil paint and scaled to the same size as the sculptures. The equally detailed backdrops include an Arcadian vision. Koons makes use of contemporary technology, including CT scans and digital imaging, to produce the metal sculptures. He reinterprets historical figures through the creation of balloon-like sculptures, such as the Metallic Venus, and by integrating representative figures and characters from comic books.\\nReferring to the ancient Roman marble statue Callipygian Venus, Metallic Venus (2010–2012) was made of high chromium stainless steel with transparent color coating and live flowering plants.\\nIn Ballerinas (2010–2014), Koons depicts figurines of dancers, derived from decorative porcelain works designed by Ukrainian artist Oksana Zhnikrup, at the imposing scale of classical sculpture.\\n\\n\\n=== Gazing Ball series ===\\nIn this series presented at Gagosian Gallery in 2015, Koons has taken 35 masterpieces, including Manet\\'s Déjeuner sur l\\'Herbe, Géricault\\'s Raft of the Medusa and Rembrandt\\'s Self-Portrait Wearing a Hat, had them repainted in oil on canvas, and added a little shelf, painted as if it had sprouted directly from the image. Each work includes a blue glass gazing ball that sits on a painted aluminum shelf attached to the front of the painting. Both viewer and painting are reflected in the gazing ball.\\nGazing Ball takes its name from the mirrored spherical ornaments frequently found on lawns, gardens, and patios around Koons\\'s childhood home in Pennsylvania. After creating Gazing Ball paintings, Koons also made several white sculptures from the Greco-Roman era along with everyday utilitarian objects encountered in today\\'s suburban and rural landscape, such as mailboxes and a birdbath.\\n\\n\\n=== Apollo series ===\\nIn June 2022, Dakis Jouannou commissioned Koons to create an artwork for his space at DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art, on the Greek island of Hydra. Koons created the series Apollo, including a sculpture titled Apollo Wind Spinner (2020–2022), a 9.1 meter (30-foot) wide reflective wind spinner above the Slaughterhouse art space. The walls within the Slaughterhouse have been transformed by using as the base the ancient frescoes from Boscoreale, near Pompeii. The exhibition includes several other new works including a pair of bronze Nike sneakers, Gazing Ball Tripod (2020–2022), and Plato\\'s Solid Forms Wind Spinners (2020–2022).\\n\\n\\n=== Recent work ===\\nFor the 2007–2008 season in the Vienna State Opera, Koons designed the large-scale picture (176 sqm) Geisha as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress. Koons worked with American pop performer Lady Gaga on her 2013 studio album Artpop, including the creation of its cover artwork featuring a sculpture he made of Lady Gaga.\\nIn September 2014, the bi-annual arts and culture publication GARAGE Magazine published Koons\\' first ever digital artwork for the front of its print edition. The piece, titled Lady Bug, is an augmented reality sculpture that can only be viewed on mobile devices through a GARAGE Magazine app, which allows viewers to explore the piece from a variety of angles as if standing on top of it.\\nIn 2012, Koons bought Advanced Stone Technologies, an offshoot of the non-profit Johnson Atelier Technical Institute of Sculpture\\'s stone division. He moved the high-tech stone workshop from New Jersey to a larger, 60,000 sq ft (5,600 m2) space in Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The facility exists solely to fabricate Koons\\' works made of stone.\\nIn 2013 Koons created the sculpture Gazing Ball (Farnese Hercules), which was inspired by the Farnese Hercules. The sculpture is made from white plaster and can be interpreted as perpetuating colorism in how we view the ancient world.\\n\\n\\n=== Other projects ===\\nIn 1999, Koons commissioned a song about himself on Momus\\' album Stars Forever.\\n\\nA drawing similar to his Tulip Balloons was placed on the front page of the Internet search engine Google. The drawing greeted all who visited Google\\'s main page on April 30, 2008, and May 1, 2008.\\nIn 2006 Koons appeared on Artstar, an unscripted television series set in the New York art world. He had a minor role in the 2008 film Milk playing state assemblyman Art Agnos.\\nIn September 2012, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo gave Koons the task of helping to review the designs for a new Tappan Zee Bridge.\\nIn late 2016, Koons unveiled plans for Bouquet of Tulips, an 11-meter high commemorative sculpture in Paris modelled on the Statue of Liberty, honoring the victims of the November 2015 attacks.\\nIn February 2024, a SpaceX rocket carrying 125 of Koon\\'s stainless steel miniature moon sculptures departed from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The sculptures, named after historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Billie Holiday, were part of a larger project involving a lunar lander designed by Intuitive Machines. The lander, which also carried NASA equipment, reached the Moon on February 22. Koons, inspired by President Kennedy\\'s vision of space exploration, saw this project as a way to inspire society. This endeavor, which included plans for larger sculptures on Earth and corresponding NFTs, aimed to be the first authorized artwork on the moon, protected under the Artemis Accords.\\n\\n\\n==== Curating ====\\nKoons acted as curator of an Ed Paschke exhibition at Gagosian Gallery, New York, in 2009. He also curated an exhibition in 2010 of works from the private collection of Greek billionaire Dakis Joannou at the New Museum in New York City. The exhibition, Skin Fruit: Selections from the Dakis Joannou Collection, generated debate concerning cronyism within the art world as Koons is heavily collected by Joannou and had previously designed the exterior of Joannou\\'s yacht Guilty.\\n\\n\\n==== BMW Art Car ====\\n\\nKoons was the artist named to design the seventeenth in the series of BMW \"Art Cars\". His artwork was applied to a race-spec E92 BMW M3, and revealed to the public at The Pompidou Centre in Paris on June 2, 2010. Backed by BMW Motorsport, the car then competed at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans in France.\\n\\n\\n==== Collaborations ====\\nIn 1989, Koons and fellow artist Martin Kippenberger worked together on an issue of the art journal Parkett; the following year, Koons designed an exhibition poster for Kippenberger.\\nIn 2013, Koons collaborated with American singer-songwriter and performance artist Lady Gaga for her third studio album, ARTPOP. The album cover depicts a nude sculpture of Gaga made by Koons behind a blue ball sculpture, and pieces of other art works in the background such as Birth of Venus painted by Sandro Botticelli, which inspired Gaga\\'s image through the new era, including in her music video for \"Applause\" and the performance of the song at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. The image of the cover was revealed piece-by-piece in a social marketing campaign where her fans had to tweet the Twitter hashtag \"#iHeartARTPOP\" to unlock it. The song \"Applause\" itself includes the lyrics \"One second I\\'m a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me.\"\\n\\nIn April 2017, Koons collaborated with the French luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton for the \"Masters Collection\" and designed a series of handbags and backpacks featuring the reproductions of his favorite masterpieces by the Old Masters, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, Vincent van Gogh, Peter Paul Rubens and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Later that year he presented another handful of bags and accessories featuring the reproductions of works by Claude Monet, J. M. W. Turner, Édouard Manet, Paul Gauguin and François Boucher. The prices range from $585 for a key chain to $4,000 for the large carryall.\\n\\n\\n==== Wine ====\\nKoons has also produced some fine wine-related commissions. In December 2012, Chateau Mouton Rothschild announced that Koons was the artist for their 2010 vintage label – a tradition that was started in 1946. Other artists to design labels include Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró, amongst others. In August 2013, Dom Pérignon released their 2004 vintage, with a special edition done by Koons, as well as a made-to-order case called the \\'Balloon Venus\\'. This has a recommended retail price of €15,000.\\n\\n\\n==== Charity ====\\nFrom February 15 to March 6, 2008, Koons donated a private tour of his studio to the Hereditary Disease Foundation for auction on Charitybuzz. From his limited-edition 2010 Tulip designs for Kiehl\\'s Crème de Corps, a portion of the proceeds went to the Koons Family Institute, an initiative of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children. Since his relationship with the International Centre began, Koons has given over US$4.3 million to the Institute that bears his family\\'s name.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince a 1980 window installation at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, Koons\\' work has been widely exhibited internationally in solo and group exhibitions. In 1986, he appeared in a group show with Peter Halley, Ashley Bickerton, Ross Minoru Lang and Meyer Vaisman at Sonnabend Gallery in New York. In 1997, the parisian Galerie Jerome de Noirmont organized his first solo show in Europe. His Made in Heaven series was first shown at the Venice Biennale in 1990.\\nAs a young artist, Koons was included in many exhibitions curated by Richard Milazzo including The New Capital at White Columns in 1984, Paravision at Postmasters Gallery in 1985, Cult and Decorum at Tibor De Nagy Gallery in 1986, Time After Time at Diane Brown Gallery in 1986, Spiritual America at CEPA in 1986, and Art at the End of the Social at The Rooseum, Malmö, Sweden in 1988. These exhibitions would be alongside other notable artists such as Ross Bleckner, Joel Otterson, and Kevin Larmon.\\nHis museum solo shows include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago (1988), Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (1993), Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin (2000), Kunsthaus Bregenz (2001), the Museo archeologico nazionale di Napoli (2003), and a retrospective survey at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo (2004), which traveled to the Helsinki City Art Museum (2005). In 2008, the Celebration series was shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, and on the roof of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\nConsidered as his first retrospective in France, the 2008 exhibition of 17 Koons sculptures at the Château de Versailles also marked the first ambitious display of a contemporary American artist organized by the château. The New York Times reported that \"several dozen people demonstrated outside the palace gates\" in a protest arranged by a little-known, right-wing group dedicated to French artistic purity. It was also criticized that ninety percent of the US$2.8 million in financing for the exhibition came from private patrons, mainly François Pinault.\\nThe May 31 – September 21, 2008, Koons retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, which was widely publicized in the press, broke the museum\\'s attendance record with 86,584 visitors. The exhibition included numerous works from the MCA collection, along with recent paintings and sculptures by the artist. The retrospective exhibition reflects the MCA\\'s commitment to Koons\\' work as it presented the artist\\'s first American survey in 1988. For the final exhibition in its Marcel Breuer building, the Whitney Museum is planning to present a Koons retrospective in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.\\nIn July 2009, Koons had his first major solo show in London, at the Serpentine Gallery. Entitled Jeff Koons: Popeye Series, the exhibit included cast aluminum models of children\\'s pool toys and \"dense, realist paintings of Popeye holding his can of spinach or smoking his pipe, a red lobster looming over his head\".\\nIn May 2012, Koons had his first major solo show in Switzerland, at the Beyeler Museum in Basel, entitled Jeff Koons. Shown are works from three series: The New,Banality and Celebration as well as the flowered sculpture Split-Rocker.\\nAlso in 2012, Jeff Koons. The Painter at Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt focussed primarily on the artist\\'s development as a painter, while in the show Jeff Koons. The Sculptor at the Liebieghaus in Frankfurt, the sculptures by Jeff Koons entered enter into dialogues with the historical building and a sculpture collection spanning five millennia. Together, both shows form the largest showing of Koons\\' work to date.\\nThe artist enjoyed a 2014 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Scott Indrisek, writing for ARTINFO.com, described it as \"brash, fairly entertaining, and as digestible as a pack of M&Ms\".\\nIn 2019 an exhibition called Jeff Koons at the Ashmolean was held at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nKoons received the BZ Cultural Award from a local Berlin newspaper in 2000 and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture in 2001. He was named a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor in 2002 and then promoted to Officier in 2007. He received an honoroary doctorate from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2008. He was given the 2008 Wollaston Award from the Royal Academy of Arts in London. In 2013 he received the U.S. State Department\\'s Medal of Arts. In 2014, Koons received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Wayne Thiebaud during the International Achievement Summit in San Francisco. In 2017 he accepted the annual Honorary Membership Award for Outstanding Contribution to Visual Culture from the Edgar Wind Society, University of Oxford.  Made Honorary Professor of Sculpture of the Fine Arts Academy of Carrara, at the 250th anniversary celebration ceremony at the Academy of Fine Arts, Carrara, Italy [April 16, 2019]\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nKoons is widely collected in America and Europe, where some collectors acquire his work in depth. Eli Broad has 24 pieces, and Dakis Joannou owns some 38 works from all stages of the artist\\'s career.\\nKoons has been represented by dealers such as Mary Boone (1979–1980), Sonnabend Gallery (1986–2021), Galerie Max Hetzler, Jérôme de Noirmont and Gagosian Gallery. The exclusive right to the primary sale of the \"Celebration\" series was long held by Gagosian Gallery, his dominant dealer for many years. Since 2021, Pace Gallery has been representing Koons exclusively worldwide.\\nMany of Koons\\' works have been sold privately at auctions. His auction records have primarily been achieved from his sculptures (especially those from his Celebration series), whereas his paintings are less popular. In 2001, one of his three Michael Jackson and Bubbles porcelain sculptures sold for US$5.6 million. On November 14, 2007, Hanging Heart (Magenta/Gold) from the collection of Adam Lindemann, one of five in different colors, sold at Sotheby\\'s New York for US$23.6 million becoming, at the time, the most expensive piece by a living artist ever auctioned. It was bought by the Gagosian Gallery in New York, which the previous day had purchased another Koons sculpture, Diamond (Blue), for US$11.8 million from Christie\\'s London. Gagosian appears to have bought both Celebration series works on behalf of Ukrainian steel oligarch Victor Pinchuk. In July 2008, his 11-foot (3.3 meter) Balloon Flower (Magenta) (1995–2000) from the collection of Howard and Cindy Rachofsky also sold at Christie\\'s London for an auction record of US$25.7 million. In total, Koons was the top-selling artist at auction with €81.3 million of sales in the year to June 2008.\\nDuring the late 2000s recession, however, art prices plummeted and auction sales of high-value works by Koons dropped 50 percent in 2009. A violet Hanging Heart sold for US$11 million in a private sale. However prices for the artist\\'s earlier Luxury and Degradation series appear to be holding up. The Economist reported that Thomas H. Lee, a private-equity investor, sold Jim Beam J.B. Turner Train (1986) in a package deal brokered by Giraud Pissarro Segalot for more than US$15 million. In 2012, Tulips (1995–2004) brought a record auction price for Koons at Christie\\'s, selling to a telephone bidder for US$33.6 million, well above its high US$25 million estimate. At Christie\\'s in 2015, the oil on canvas Triple Elvis (2009) set a world auction record for a painting by the artist, selling for $8,565,000, over $5 million more than the previous high. Koons\\'s stainless steel Rabbit (1986) sold for $91.1 million at auction in 2019, making it the most expensive work sold by a living artist at auction.\\nIn 2018, billionaire art collector Steven Tananbaum brought a lawsuit against Koons and Gagosian Gallery for failing to deliver three sculptures, Balloon Venus, Eros and Diana, for which he paid $13 million. Soon after, Hollywood producer Joel Silver filed a similar lawsuit against Gagosion and Koons for failure to deliver an $8 million sculpture in 2014. Both lawsuits were settled in 2019 and 2020.\\n\\n\\n== Classification ==\\nAmong curators and art collectors and others in the art world, Koons\\' work is labeled as Neo-pop or Post-Pop as part of a 1980s movement in reaction to the pared-down art of Minimalism and Conceptualism in the previous decade. Koons resists such comments: \"A viewer might at first see irony in my work ... but I see none at all. Irony causes too much critical contemplation\". Koons rejects any hidden meaning in his artwork.\\nHe has caused controversy by the elevation of unashamed kitsch into the high-art arena, exploiting more throwaway subjects than, for example, Warhol\\'s Campbell\\'s Soup Cans. His work Balloon Dog (1994–2000) is based on balloons twisted into shape to make a toy dog.\\nTheorist Samito Jalbuena wrote, \"From the beginning of his controversial career, Koons overturned the traditional notion of art inside and out. Focusing on banal objects as models, he questioned standards of normative values in art, and, instead, embraced the vulnerabilities of aesthetic hierarchies and taste systems.\"\\n\\n\\n== Evaluation and influence ==\\nKoons has received polarized reactions to his work. Critic Amy Dempsey described his Balloon Dog as \"an awesome presence... a massive durable monument\". Jerry Saltz at artnet.com has commented on being \"wowed by the technical virtuosity and eye-popping visual blast\" of Koons\\' art. Koons was among the names in Blake Gopnik\\'s 2011 list \"The 10 Most Important Artists of Today\", with Gopnik arguing, \"Even after 30 years, Koons\\'s mashups of high and low—a dog knotted from balloons, then enlarged into a public monument; a life-size bust of Michael Jackson and his chimp in gold-and-white porcelain—still feel significant.\"\\nMark Stevens of The New Republic dismissed him as a \"decadent artist [who] lacks the imaginative will to do more than trivialize and italicize his themes and the tradition in which he works... He is another of those who serve the tacky rich\". Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times saw \"one last, pathetic gasp of the sort of self-promoting hype and sensationalism that characterized the worst of the 1980s\" and called Koons\\' work \"artificial\", \"cheap\", and \"unabashedly cynical\".\\nIn an article comparing the contemporary art scene with show business, renowned critic Robert Hughes wrote that Koons is\\n\\nan extreme and self-satisfied manifestation of the sanctimony that attaches to big bucks. Koons really does think he\\'s Michelangelo and is not shy to say so. The significant thing is that there are collectors, especially in America, who believe it. He has the slimy assurance, the gross patter about transcendence through art, of a blow-dried Baptist selling swamp acres in Florida. And the result is that you can\\'t imagine America\\'s singularly depraved culture without him.\\nHughes placed Koons\\' work just above that of Seward Johnson and was quoted in a New York Times article as having stated that comparing their careers was \"like debating the merits of dog excrement versus cat excrement\".\\nHe has influenced younger artists such as Damien Hirst (for example, in Hirst\\'s Hymn, an 18 ft (5.5 m) version of a 14 in (0.36 m) anatomical toy), Jack Daws, Matthieu Laurette and Mona Hatoum. In turn, his extreme enlargement of mundane objects owes a debt to Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. Much of his work also was influenced by artists working in Chicago during his study at the Art Institute, including Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke and H. C. Westermann.\\nIn 2005, he was elected as a Fellow to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\\n\\n\\n== Copyright infringement litigation ==\\nKoons has been sued several times for copyright infringement over his use of pre-existing images, the original works of others, in his work. In Rogers v. Koons, 960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir. 1992), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a judgment against him for his use of a photograph of puppies as the basis for a sculpture, String of Puppies.\\nKoons also lost lawsuits in United Features Syndicate, Inc. v. Koons, 817 F. Supp. 370 (S.D.N.Y. 1993), and Campbell v. Koons, No. 91 Civ. 6055, 1993 WL 97381 (S.D.N.Y. April 1, 1993).\\nHe won one lawsuit, Blanch v. Koons, No. 03 Civ. 8026 (LLS), S.D.N.Y., November 1, 2005 (slip op.), affirmed by the Second Circuit in October 2006, brought over his use of a photographic advertisement as source material for legs and feet in a painting, Niagara (2000). The court ruled that Koons had sufficiently transformed the original advertisement so as to qualify as a fair use of the original image.\\nIn 2015, Koons faced allegations he used photographer Mitchel Gray\\'s 1986 photo for Gordon\\'s Gin in one of his Luxury and Degradation paintings without permission or compensation.\\nIn 2018, a French court ruled that his 1988 work Fait d\\'Hiver, which depicts a pig standing over a woman who is lying on her back, had copied an advertisement for a clothing chain and found Koons and the Centre Pompidou guilty of infringing photographer Franck Davidovici\\'s copyright. This decision was upheld in 2021 on appeal. The result is that the work, owned by Foundazione Prada, cannot be displayed in France and the museum and artist cannot display photographic reproductions online (without a penalty of €600 per day). In addition, the museum and artist were ordered to jointly pay €190,000 and the book company €14,000.\\nIn 2019, a French court ruled that his work 1988 Naked, which depicts a little boy offering flowers to a little girl, both of whom are naked, had infringed on the copyright of a 1975 postcard photograph by French artist Jean-Francois Bauret.\\nKoons has also accused others of copyright infringement, claiming that a bookstore in San Francisco infringed his copyright in Balloon Dogs by selling bookends in the shape of balloon dogs. Koons dropped the lawsuit after the bookstore\\'s lawyer filed a motion for declaratory relief stating, \"As virtually any clown can attest, no one owns the idea of making a balloon dog, and the shape created by twisting a balloon into a dog-like form is part of the public domain\".\\nA Koons sculpture of a ballerina resembles the piece Ballerina Lenochka created by the Ukrainian artist Oksana Zhnykrup in 1974.\\nIn a 2021 complaint filed at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, artist Michael Hayden who made a sculpture in 1988 of a serpent wrapped around a rock for Ilona Staller claimed that Koons unlawfully used the sculpture in his works.\\n\\n\\n== ICMEC\\'s Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy ==\\nKoons is a member of the board of directors of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), a global nonprofit organization that combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction. In 2007, Koons, along with his wife Justine, founded the ICMEC Koons Family Institute on International Law and Policy.\\nFollowing the end of his first marriage in 1994 to Hungarian-born Italian actress Ilona Staller, Staller left for Italy with their two-year-old son in violation of a US court order. Koons spent five years pursuing his parental rights. The Italian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Staller. Koons subsequently established the Koons Family Institute. In 2008, Staller filed suit against Koons for failure to pay child support.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nWhile a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art, Koons fathered a daughter, Shannon Rodgers. The couple put the child up for adoption. Rodgers reconnected with Koons in 1995. Koons has said that the adoption \"helped make me want to have more visibility so that my daughter could find me. I always hoped that we could reconnect.\"\\nIn 1991, he married Hungarian-born naturalized-Italian pornography star Ilona Staller (Cicciolina) who at the time was a member of the Italian Parliament (1987–1992). Koons collaborated with Staller for the \"Made in Heaven\" paintings and sculptures in various media, with the hopes of making a film. While maintaining a home in Manhattan, Koons and Staller lived in Munich. In 1992, they had a son, Ludwig. The marriage ended soon afterward amid allegations that Koons had subjected Staller to physical and emotional abuse.\\nKoons later married Justine Wheeler, an artist and former employee who began working in Koons\\' studio in 1995. As of June 2009, the couple have four children together. In January 2009, the family were living in an Upper East Side townhouse.\\nKoons donated $50,000 to Correct the Record, a Super PAC which supported Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 presidential campaign in June 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Film and video ==\\nJeff Koons: the Banality Work by Jeff Koons, Paul Tschinkel, Sarah Berry.

              "  'Richard Wilson  (born 24 May 1953) is an English sculptor, installation artist and musician.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBorn in Islington, London, Wilson studied at the London College of Printing, Hornsey College of Art and Reading University. He was the DAAD resident in Berlin in 1992, Maeda Visiting Artist at the Architectural Association in 1998 and nominated for the Turner Prize in both 1988 (when Tony Cragg won) and 1989 (when Richard Long won).\\nWilson\\'s first solo show was 11 Pieces, at the Coracle Press Gallery in London in 1976.  Since then he has had at least 50 solo exhibitions around the world.\\nHe formed the Bow Gamelan Ensemble in 1983 with Anne Bean and Paul Burwell.\\nWilson\\'s work is characterised by architectural concerns with volume, illusionary spaces and auditory perception. His most famous work 20:50, a room of specific proportions, part-filled with highly reflective used sump oil creating an illusion of the room turned upside down was first exhibited at Matt\\'s Gallery, London in 1987, became one of the signature pieces of the Saatchi Gallery. It is considered to be a defining work in the genre of site-specific installation art. The same year the temporary (May–June) installation One Piece at a Time filled the south tower of the Tyne Bridge at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\\nIn the 1990s and 21st century, Wilson continued to work on a large scale to fulfil his ambitions to \"tweak or undo or change the interiors of space... in that way unsettle or break peoples preconceptions of space, what they think space might be\", including an installation near London\\'s Millennium Dome called A Slice of Reality in 2000. It consisted of a portion (15%) of a ship being sliced off from the rest and mounted on the river bed. In 2007, Wilson installed Turning the Place Over in a building in Liverpool\\'s city centre. Described by Liverpool Biennial organisers as his \"most radical intervention into architecture to date\", Wilson cut an 8-metre diameter disc from the walls and windows of the building, and attached it to a motor which literally turned this section of the building inside out, in a cycle lasting just over two minutes. It was switched off in 2011. In 2009, Wilson\\'s architectural intervention, Square the Block, was installed on the northwest exterior of the London School of Economics (LSE)\\'s New Academic Building at the corner of Kingsway and Sardinia Street. Commissioned by the LSE and curated by the Contemporary Art Society, Square the Block is an outdoor sculpture that both mimics and subtly subverts the existing façade of the building.

              "  'Sir Anish Mikhail Kapoor,  (born 12 March 1954) is a British-Indian sculptor specializing in installation art and conceptual art. Born in Mumbai, Kapoor attended the elite all-boys Indian boarding school The Doon School, before moving to the UK to begin his art training at Hornsey College of Art and, later, Chelsea School of Art and Design.\\nHis notable public sculptures include Cloud Gate (2006, also known as \"The Bean\") in Chicago\\'s Millennium Park; Sky Mirror, exhibited at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2006 and Kensington Gardens in London in 2010; Temenos, at Middlehaven, Middlesbrough; Leviathan, at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2011; and ArcelorMittal Orbit, commissioned as a permanent artwork for London\\'s Olympic Park and completed in 2012. In 2017, Kapoor designed the statuette for the 2018 Brit Awards.\\nAn image of Kapoor features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015. In 2016, he was announced as a recipient of the LennonOno Grant for Peace.\\nKapoor has received several distinctions and prizes, such as the Premio Duemila Prize at the XLIV Venice Biennale in 1990, the Turner Prize in 1991, the Unilever Commission for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government in 2012, a knighthood in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to visual arts, an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Oxford in 2014. and the 2017 Genesis Prize for \"being one of the most influential and innovative artists of his generation and for his many years of advocacy for refugees and displaced people\".\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAnish Mikhail Kapoor was born in Mumbai, India, to an Iraqi Jewish mother and an Indian Punjabi Hindu father. His maternal grandfather served as cantor of the synagogue in Pune. At the time, Baghdadi Jews constituted the majority of the Jewish community in Mumbai. His father was a hydrographer and applied physicist who served in the Indian Navy. Kapoor is the brother of Ilan Kapoor, a professor at York University, Toronto, Canada.\\nKapoor attended The Doon School, an all-boys boarding school in Dehradun, India. In 1971 he moved to Israel with one of his two brothers, initially living on a kibbutz. He began to study electrical engineering, but had trouble with mathematics and quit after six months. In Israel, he decided to become an artist. In 1973, he left for Britain to attend Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art and Design. There he found a role model in Paul Neagu, an artist who provided a meaning to what he was doing. Kapoor went on to teach at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1979 and in 1982 was Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. He has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nKapoor became known in the 1980s for his geometric or biomorphic sculptures using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment and plaster. These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. He has said of the sculptures \"While making the pigment pieces, it occurred to me that they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided to give them a generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there...\" Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Kapoor was acclaimed for his explorations of matter and non-matter, specifically evoking the void in both free-standing sculptural works and ambitious installations. Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. In 1987, he began working in stone. His later stone works are made of solid, quarried stone, many of which have carved apertures and cavities, often alluding to, and playing with dualities (earth-sky, matter-spirit, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, conscious-unconscious, male-female, and body-mind). \"In the end, I’m talking about myself. And thinking about making nothing, which I see as a void. But then that’s something, even though it really is nothing.\"\\nSince 1995, he has worked with the highly reflective surface of polished stainless steel. These works are mirror-like, reflecting or distorting the viewer and surroundings. Over the course of the following decade Kapoor\\'s sculptures ventured into more ambitious manipulations of form and space. He produced a number of large works, including Taratantara (1999), a 35-metre-high piece which was installed in the Baltic Flour Mills in Gateshead, England, prior to the renovation beginning there which turned the structure into the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art; and Marsyas (2002), a large work consisting of three steel rings joined by a single span of PVC membrane that reached end to end of the 3,400-square-foot (320 m2) Turbine Hall of Tate Modern. Kapoor\\'s Eye in Stone (Norwegian: Øye i stein) is permanently placed at the shore of the fjord in Lødingen in northern Norway as part of Artscape Nordland. In 2000, one of Kapoor\\'s works, Parabolic Waters, consisting of rapidly rotating coloured water, was shown outside the Millennium Dome in London.\\nThe use of red wax is also part of his repertoire, evocative of flesh, blood, and transfiguration. In 2007, he showed Svayambh (which translated from Sanskrit means \"self-generated\"), a 1.5-metre block of red wax that moved on rails through the Nantes Musée des Beaux-Arts as part of the Biennale estuaire; this piece was shown again in a major show at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London. Some of Kapoor\\'s work blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. In 2008, Kapoor created Memory in Berlin and New York for the Guggenheim Foundation, his first piece in Cor-Ten, which is formulated to produce a protective coating of rust. Weighing 24 tons and made up of 156 parts, it calls to mind Richard Serra\\'s huge, rusty steel works, which also invite viewers into perceptually confounding interiors.\\nIn 2009, Kapoor became the first Guest Artistic Director of Brighton Festival. Kapoor installed four sculptures during the festival: Sky Mirror at Brighton Pavilion gardens; C-Curve at The Chattri, Blood Relations (a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie); and 1000 Names, both at the Fabrica Gallery. He also created a large site-specific work titled The Dismemberment of Jeanne d’Arc and a performance-based installation: Imagined Monochrome. The public response was so overwhelming that police had to re-divert traffic around C Curve at the Chattri and exercise crowd control.\\nIn September 2009, Kapoor was the first living artist to have a solo exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts. As well as surveying his career to date, the show also included new works. On display were Non-Object mirror works, cement sculptures previously unseen, and Shooting into the Corner, a cannon that fires pellets of wax into the corner of the gallery. Previously shown at MAK, Vienna, in January 2009, it is a work with dramatic presence and associations and also continues Kapoor\\'s interest in the self-made object, as the wax builds up on the walls and floor of the gallery the work slowly oozes out its form.\\nIn early 2011, Kapoor\\'s work, Leviathan, was the annual Monumenta installation for the Grand Palais in Paris. Kapoor described the work as: \"A single object, a single form, a single colour...My ambition is to create a space with in a space that responds to the height and luminosity of the Nave at the Grand Palais. Visitors will be invited to walk inside the work, to immerse themselves in colour, and it will, I hope, be a contemplative and poetic experience.\"\\nIn 2011, Kapoor exhibited Dirty Corner at the Fabbrica del Vapore in Milan. Having fully occupied the site\\'s \"cathedral\" space, the work consists of a huge steel volume, 60 metres long and 8 metres high, that visitors enter. Inside, they gradually lose their perception of space, as it gets progressively darker and darker until there is no light, forcing people to use their other senses to guide them through the space. The entrance of the tunnel is goblet-shaped, featuring an interior and exterior surface that is circular, making minimal contact with the ground. Over the course of the exhibition, the work was progressively covered by some 160 cubic metres of earth by a large mechanical device, forming a sharp mountain of dirt which the tunnel appears to be running through.\\nIn 2016, his art exposition in MUAC (Mexico City) was a success, with literary contributions from Catherine Lampert, Cecilia Delgado, and Mexican writer Pablo Soler Frost.\\nKapoor sued the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) in 2018. The gun lobby group had, without the sculptor\\'s consent, used a filmed image of Cloud Gate in an approximately one-minute-long promotional video called \"The Violence of Lies\". The suit was ultimately settled out of court. Kapoor reported that the settlement included the removal of his work from the NRA\\'s film, saying \"They have now complied with our demand to remove the unauthorized image of my sculpture Cloud Gate from their abhorrent video, which seeks to promote fear, hostility, and division in American society\".\\n\\n\\n=== Public commissions ===\\n\\nKapoor\\'s earliest public commissions include the Cast Iron Mountain at the Tachikawa Art Project in Japan, as well as an untitled 1995 piece installed at Toronto\\'s Simcoe Place resembling mountain peaks. In 2001, Sky Mirror, a large mirror piece that reflects the sky and surroundings, was commissioned for a site outside the Nottingham Playhouse. Since 2006, The Bean, a 110-ton stainless steel sculpture with a mirror finish, officially titled Cloud Gate, has been permanently installed in Millennium Park in Chicago. Viewers are able to walk beneath the sculpture and look up into an bellybutton or \"omphalos\" above them.\\nIn the autumn of 2006, a second 10-metre Sky Mirror, was installed at Rockefeller Center, New York City. This work was later exhibited in Kensington Gardens in 2010 as part of the show Turning the World Upside Down, along with three other major mirror works.\\n\\nIn 2009, Kapoor created the permanent, site-specific work Earth Cinema for Pollino National Park, the largest national park in Italy, as part of the project ArtePollino – Another South. Kapoor\\'s work, Cinema di Terra (Earth Cinema), is a 45m long, 3m wide and 7m deep cut into the landscape made from concrete and earth. People can enter from both sides and walk along it, viewing the earth void within. Cinema di Terra officially opened to public in September 2009.\\nKapoor was also commissioned by Tees Valley Regeneration (TVR) to produce five pieces of public art, collectively known as the Tees Valley Giants. The first of these sculptures, Tememos, was unveiled to the public in June 2010. Temenos stands 50 metres high and is 110 metres in length. A steel wire mesh pulled taut between two enormous steel hoops, it remains an ethereal and an uncertain form despite its colossal scale.\\nIn 2010, Turning the World Upside Down, Jerusalem was commissioned and installed at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  The sculpture is described as a \"16-foot tall polished-steel hourglass\" and it \"reflects and reverses the Jerusalem sky and the museum\\'s landscape, a likely reference to the city\\'s duality of celestial and earthly, holy and profane\".\\nThe Greater London Authority selected Kapoor\\'s Orbit sculpture from a shortlist of five artists as the permanent artwork for the Olympic Park of the 2012 Olympic Games. At 115 metres tall, Orbit is the tallest sculpture in the UK.\\nWhen asked if engagement with people and places is the key to successful public art, Kapoor said:\\n\\nI’m thinking about the mythical wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Tower of Babel. It\\'s as if the collective will comes up with something that has resonance on an individual level and so becomes mythic. I can claim to take that as a model for a way of thinking. Art can do it, and I’m going to have a damn good go. I want to occupy the territory, but the territory is an idea and a way of thinking as much as a context that generates objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Architectural projects ===\\nThroughout his career, Kapoor has worked extensively with architects and engineers. He says this body of work is neither pure sculpture nor pure architecture.\\nHis notable architectural projects include:\\n\\nArk Nova, an inflatable concert hall that will travel around the earthquake struck regions of Japan, designed in collaboration with architect Arata Isozaki.\\nOrbit, the permanent artwork for London\\'s Olympic Park, in collaboration with engineer Cecil Balmond.\\nTemenos the first work of the Tees Valley Giants, the world\\'s five largest sculptures, in collaboration with Cecil Balmond. Temenos is situated in Middlehaven Dock, Middlesbrough.\\nDismemberment Site 1, installed in New Zealand at the Gibbs Farm sculpture park, owned by New Zealand businessman and art patron Alan Gibbs.\\n56 Leonard Street, New York, in collaboration with architects Herzog and de Meuron.\\nTwo subway stations in Naples at Monte San Angelo and Triano in collaboration with Future Systems.\\nTaratantara (1999–2000) was installed at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead and later at Piazza Plebiscito, Naples.\\nAn unrealised project for the Millennium Dome, London, (1995) in collaboration with Philip Gumuchdjian.\\nBuilding for a Void, created for Expo \\'92, Seville, in collaboration with David Connor.\\nOf his vision for the Cumana station in Monte Sant\\'Angelo, Naples, Italy under construction (as of June 2008), Kapoor has said:\\n\\nIt\\'s very vulva-like. The tradition of the Paris or Moscow metro is of palaces of light, underground. I wanted to do exactly the opposite – to acknowledge that we are going underground. So it\\'s dark, and what I’ve done is bring the tunnel up and roll it over as a form like a sock.\\n\\n\\n=== Working with text ===\\nIn a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie, Kapoor conceived a sculpture consisting of two bronze boxes conjoined with red wax and inscribed around the outside with the first two paragraphs of Rushdie\\'s text; \"Blood Relations\" or an \"Interrogation of the Arabian Nights\" in 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Stage design ===\\nKapoor has designed stage sets including for; the opera Idomeneo at Glyndebourne in 2003; Pelléas et Mélisande, La Monnaie in Brussels, and a dance-theatre piece called in-i with Akram Khan and Juliette Binoche at the National Theatre in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Anish Kapoor Foundation ===\\nThe Anish Kapoor Foundation was founded as a charity in 2017, registered in London. In early 2021, the Venice city council approved construction plans for the foundation to convert the Palazzo Priuli Manfrin into an exhibition venue, artist studio and repository for a number of the artist\\'s works from the foundation\\'s collection. The project will be led by architecture firms FWR Associati of Venice and Studio Una of Hamburg.\\n\\n\\n=== Work with Vantablack ===\\nIn 2014, Kapoor began working with Vantablack, a super-black material that uses vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays (VANTAs) and has high absorption in the visible light band, also called the \"blackest black\". As part of the agreement between him and Vantablack, he held an exclusive artistic license for a spray-on version of the substance. Artists Stuart Semple, Christian Furr and Shanti Panchal criticised the exclusive licensing agreement for excluding other artists from its use. \\nIn retaliation, Semple developed a pigment called the \"pinkest pink\" and specifically made it available to everyone except Anish Kapoor and anyone affiliated with him. In December 2016, Kapoor obtained the pigment and posted an image on Instagram of his extended middle finger which had been dipped in Semple\\'s pink. Semple also developed more products such as \"Black 2.0\" and \"Black 3.0\", which are supposed to look nearly identical to Vantablack. Subsequent studies have found that Semple\\'s black paints are less black than pigments that use VANTAs.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nKapoor initially began exhibiting as part of New British Sculpture art scene, along with fellow British sculptors Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon. His first solo exhibition took place at Patrice Alexandra, Paris, in 1980. He achieved widespread recognition when he represented Britain at the 1990 Venice Biennale, and recounts the experience in Sarah Thornton\\'s Seven Days in the Art World. In 1992 Kapoor contributed to documenta IX with Building Descent into Limbo. In 2004, he participated in The 5th Gwangju Biennale in Gwangju, Korea. Solo exhibitions of his work have since been held in the Tate and Hayward Gallery in London, Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland, Reina Sofia in Madrid, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Musée des arts contemporains (Grand-Hornu) in Belgium, the CAPC Museum of Contemporary Art in Bordeaux, the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in Brazil, and the Guggenheim in Bilbao, New York City and Berlin.\\nIn 2008, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston held the first U.S. mid career survey of Kapoor\\'s work. That same year, Kapoor\\'s Islamic Mirror (2008), a circular concave mirror, was installed in a 13th-century Arab palace now being used as by the Convent of Santa Clara in Murcia, Spain.\\nKapoor was the first living British artist to take over the Royal Academy, London, in 2009; the show attracted 275,000 visitors, rendering it at the time the most successful exhibition ever by a living artist held in London. Eventually it was overtaken by the more than 478,000 who attended the David Hockney exhibition at the Tate Modern in 2017. This show subsequently travelled to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2010, Kapoor retrospective exhibitions were held at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in New Delhi and Mumbai\\'s Mehboob Studio, the first showcase of his work in the country of his birth. In 2011 Kapoor had a solo touring exhibition with the Arts Council, part of their \"Flashback \" series of shows. In May he exhibited Leviathan at the Grand Palais, and two concurrent shows in Milan at the Rotonda della Besana and Fabbrica del Vapore.  He had a major exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (MCA) from December 2012 to April 2013 as part of the Sydney International Art Series.\\nDirty Corner, exhibited at the Palace of Versailles in 2015, was a topic of controversy due to its \"blatantly sexual\" nature. Kapoor himself reportedly described the work as \"the vagina of a queen who is taking power\".\\nIn 2020 Kapoor unveiled a new exhibition at the grounds of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. It was the largest ever outdoor exhibition of pieces by Kapoor, containing 21 sculptures, some previously unseen, as well as a selection of drawings of his.\\nFrom 2 October 2021 – 13 February 2022 an exhibition of works created during the pandemic – ‘Painting’ – was shown at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nKapoor\\'s work is collected worldwide, notably by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; Tate Modern in London; Fondazione Prada in Milan; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; the Guggenheim in Bilbao; De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in Tilburg, the Netherlands; the Moderna Museet, Stockholm; the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan; and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1995, Kapoor married German-born medieval art historian Susanne Spicale. They have a daughter Alba and a son Ishan and lived in a house designed by architect Tony Fretton in Chelsea, London. In 2009, Kapoor purchased a 14,500 sq ft (1,350 m2) Georgian-style residence at Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields for about £3.6 million and had it redesigned by David Chipperfield. The couple separated and divorced in 2013. He later married garden designer Sophie Walker, his former sculptor\\'s assistant, after the two began dating in 2013. The couple has one daughter together.\\n\\n\\n== Literature ==\\nHeinz-Norbert Jocksin conversation with Anish Kapoor.

              "  'Tomasz Urbanowicz (born 1959 in Wrocław, Poland) is an architect and a designer of architectural glass art.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nTomasz Urbanowicz graduated at the Faculty of Architecture of the Wrocław University of Technology (1978–85). He took glass-window studies at the Fine Arts Academy of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland (1982–85) and worked as an assistant in the Painting and Sculpture Establishment at the Architecture Department of Wrocław Institute. In 1987, together with his wife, architect Beata Urbanowicz, he established his own studio, Archiglass, focused on creating architectural glass art.

              "  'Matthieu Laurette (born 1970 in Villeneuve Saint Georges, France) is a media and conceptual contemporary French artist who works in a variety of media, from TV and video to installation and public interventions.\\nHe lives and works in Paris, Amsterdam, Bogotá, Mexico, Rio de Janeiro and New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nIn 2003, Laurette received  the Ricard Prize for the most representative artist under 40 y.o. within the French scene.\\nLaurette uses various strategies to explore the relationships between conceptual art, Pop art, Institutional Critique, economics and contemporary society. His best known works  are Apparitions (1993-ongoing), Money-back Products (Produits remboursés) (1991–2001), Citizenship Project (1996-ongoing), El Gran Trueque (2000) and Déjà vu, The International Look-alike Conventions (2000-ongoing), I AM AN ARTIST (1998-ongoing), THINGS: Purchased With Funds Provided By (2010 – 2020), Tropicalize Me! (2011-ongoing) and DEMANDS & SUPPLIES (2012-ongoing).\\nIn 1993, Laurette declared himself  an artist in a French TV gameshow called Tournez manège (The Dating Game). When the presenter asked him who he was he replied: \\'A multimedia artist\\'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their homes.\\nSince his first Apparition on Tournez Manége, Laurette has been developing an ongoing series of what he calls \\'Apparitions\\' on TV and in the media. (In French the word Apparition means both \\'apparition\\' and \\'appearance\\'). Among other shows he has appeared in La Grande famille, Canal +, TV (France) (December 5, 1994), Je passe à la télé, France 3, TV (France) (May 16, 1996), Journal de 13h et Journal de 20h France 2, TV (France) (May 16, 1997).\\nLaurette\\'s Apparition: The Today Show, NBC, 31 December 2004, (Guy Debord Is So Cool!) (2004) renegotiates the critique of mass media: amongst love message banners and goofy signs being held up by the audience of the outdoor-broadcast of the NBC infotainment show on Rockefeller Plaza in New York, Laurette held a pink cardboard sign stating “GUY DEBORD IS SO COOL!”\\nLaurette\\'s Produits remboursés/Money-back Products (1993–2001) was his method of shopping and being fully refunded based on the basic marketing system of the major food and commodities corporations. He fed and cleaned himself for nothing by almost only ever buying products with \"Satisfied or your money back\" or \"Money back on first purchase\" offers. He gained fame in France and abroad at the time appearing on TV and media including in 1997 the French National evening news (Journal de 20h, France 2) and the frontpage of respected daily newspaper Le Monde with the headline \\'Tomorrow we will eat for free\\' (Demain on mange gratis). In 1999 the Daily Express in UK featured him in an article titled \"The secret of free shopping\" and in 2000 the Daily Record named him \\'The Freebie King\\'. In 2001 invited by Harald Szeemann curator of the 49th Venice Biennale he presented Moneyback Life! a large retrospective installation combining enlargements of press cuttings, a truck with an integrated TV wall showing TV clips of his Apparitions/Appearances and a life size wax figure of himself pushing a shopping cart full of Moneyback products.\\nCitizenship Project (Wanted: Financial Support to Acquire Citizenships) are a series of projects where Laurette attempts to acquire as many nationalities as possible, asking for donations as well as legal advice and practical support through donation boxes displayed in Museums and exhibitions as well as through websites. At the Venice Biennale in 2001, he offered non-represented countries national participation in the exhibition in exchange for the country granting him citizenship.\\nProduced by Consonni, El Gran Trueque (The Great Exchange) (2000), the TV game Laurette has created, with its own copyrighted concept, offered TV viewers in Bilbao a chance to buy objects in exchange for a car offered by Laurette – the highest offer would be accepted, and then in turn be presented the following week for another exchange, and so on. After a few months the series of swaps finished with a set of six blue glasses that remained unswapped.\\nThe Déjà vu - International Look-Alike Conventions featuring among others Jennifer Aniston, Sean Connery, Salvador Dalí or Angelina Jolie look-alikes mingling with the crowd of art people, collectors and real celebrities are organized by Laurette on the occasion of art openings. These events have so far been held at Dia Art Foundation Fall Gala, New York (2004), Institute of Contemporary Art, London (2003); Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania (2003); Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Australia (2002); Art Sonje Center, Seoul (2002); Castello di Rivoli, Torino (2001); and Centre Pompidou, Paris (2000).\\nMatthieu Laurette has been represented by Yvon Lambert Gallery, Paris (France);  Deweer Gallery, Otegem (Belgium); Gaudel de Stampa, Paris (France); La Central, Bogotá (Colombia), Blow de la Barra, London (UK); Yvon Lambert Gallery, New York (U.S.); Jousse Entreprise, Paris (France); Jousse Seguin, Paris (France).\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\"The Real World: Artist Matthieu Laurette and the prolific curator, collector and dealer Seth Siegelaub discuss the legacy of Conceptual art, the origins of curating and how art history is made.\" FRIEZE #154, April 2013 (London)\\nJoerg Heiser, Matthieu Laurette in Notre Histoire.

              "  'Lee Lozano (November 5, 1930 – October 2, 1999) was an American painter, and visual and conceptual artist.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nBorn Lenore Knaster in Newark, New Jersey, she started to use the name \"Lee\" at the age of fourteen, often preferring to go by the simpler, if more enigmatic \"E\". She attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate from 1948 to 1951, studying philosophy and natural sciences, and received a B.A. She married Adrian Lozano, a Mexico-born architect, in 1956; they divorced four years later. During the marriage she earned a B.F.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago.\\nAfter traveling in Europe for a year, Lozano moved to New York City to pursue a career as an artist. She had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966. Many of her early paintings and drawings were done in a raw expressionistic style. Her so-called \"comix\" often featured hand-held tools embellished to resemble genitalia or positioned in a suggestive manner. These images were sometimes accompanied by provocative texts and sexual innuendos. Lozano\\'s art of this period is often compared to early works by Claes Oldenburg and late works by Philip Guston. In the late 1960s, she experimented with a more Minimalist aesthetic, creating monochromatic Wave paintings based on the physics of light.\\n\\n\\n=== Career as a conceptualist ===\\nLike many of her contemporaries, including Adrian Piper and Vito Acconci, Lozano began to pursue conceptual art projects starting in the mid-1960s. In February 1969 she commenced her General Strike Piece, in which she withdrew from the New York art world. Her instructions to herself were as follows: GRADUALLY BUT DETERMINEDLY AVOID BEING PRESENT AT OFFICIAL OR PUBLIC \"UPTOWN\" FUNCTIONS OR GATHERINGS RELATED TO THE \"ART WORLD\" IN ORDER TO PURSUE INVESTIGATIONS OF TOTAL PERSONAL AND PUBLIC REVOLUTION. EXHIBIT IN PUBLIC ONLY PIECES WHICH FURTHER SHARING OF IDEAS & INFORMATION RELATED TO TOTAL PERSONAL AND PUBLIC REVOLUTION. In April 1969, Lozano began her Grass and No-Grass pieces, in which she smoked and abstained (semi-successfully) from marijuana every day for several weeks at a time. In 1969 Lee\\'s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde journal which experimented with language and meaning-making.\\nIn August 1971, she began another notorious work of refusal, Decide to Boycott Women. What began as a one-month experiment intended to improve communication with women wound up as a twenty-seven year hiatus from speaking or otherwise relating to them. Her systematic rejection of all members of her own gender lasted for the remainder of her life; she effectively cut off ties with friends, fellow artists, gallerists, and other women who had been long-time supporters of her art, including the feminist curator and art critic Lucy Lippard. Art historian and critic Helen Molesworth has noted that these two conceptual works signaled Lozano\\'s simultaneous rejection of capitalism and patriarchy.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works ==\\nLee Lozano\\'s Tool Paintings is a series of paintings of screwdrivers, bolts, wrenches, clamps, and hammers, anthropomorphized so that they appear to be in sexualized motion. She began painting objects that identified with male power and productivity in 1963.\\nIn 1967, the artist made a list of her titles of paintings called ‘ALL VERBS: REAM, SPIN, VEER, SPAN, CROSS, RAM, PEEL, CHARGE, PITCH, VERGE, SWITCH, SHOOT, SLIDE, JUT, HACK, BREACH, STROKE, STOP’. Her list is in advance of Richard Serra\\'s ‘Verb List Compilation: Actions to Relate to Oneself’ from 1967 to 1968. The paintings were compositions of edges and spirals in greyscale.\\nUntitled (General Strike Piece), begun in 1969, in which she cut herself off from the commercial art world; and Boycott Piece, which began in 1971, as a month-long experiment intended to improve communication but became a permanent \"boycott\" of speaking to or directly interacting with women. She notes that “Dropout Piece is the hardest work I have ever done.\"\\n\\n\\n== Final years ==\\nAfter being evicted from her studio loft on Grand & Green Street in SoHo, Lozano moved uptown to St. Nicholas Avenue until she moved to her parents\\' house in Dallas, Texas in 1982, culminating yet another project (Drop Out). She continued to pursue private conceptual projects, including Masturbation Investigation and Dialogue Piece, but fell into relative obscurity until the late 1990s, when she was diagnosed with inoperable cervical cancer. She was persuaded to allow several concurrent exhibitions of her work, three at SoHo galleries and one at the Wadsworth Atheneum, which revived her legacy just before her death in 1999 at the age of 68.\\nInterviewed in 2001, Lucy Lippard noted that \"Lee was extraordinarily intense, one of the first, if not the first person (along with Ian Wilson) who did the life-as-art thing. The kind of things other people did as art, she really did as life—and it took us a while to figure that out.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nMichelle Pirano, Target Practice: Painting Under Attack 1949–78.

              "  'Martin Kippenberger (25 February 1953 – 7 March 1997) was a German artist known for his extremely prolific output in a wide range of styles and media, superfiction as well as his provocative, jocular and hard-drinking public persona.\\nKippenberger was \"widely regarded as one of the most talented German artists of his generation,\" according to Roberta Smith of the New York Times. He was at the center of a generation of German enfants terribles including Albert Oehlen, Markus Oehlen, Werner Büttner, Georg Herold, Dieter Göls, and Günther Förg.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n \\n\\nKippenberger was born in Dortmund in 1953, the only boy in a family with five children, with two elder and two younger sisters. His father was director of the Katharina-Elisabeth colliery, his mother a dermatologist. When Kippenberger\\'s mother was killed by a pallet falling off a truck, he inherited enough money to live on. He studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where Sigmar Polke, despite not teaching him directly, influenced him. After a sojourn in Florence, where he had his first solo show in 1977, he settled in Berlin in 1978. In that year he founded Kippenberger\\'s Office with Gisela Capitain, mounting exhibitions of his own art and that of his friends. During that same period, Kippenberger also became business director of SO36, a performance, film and music space, and started a punk band called the Grugas, which recorded a single called Luxus with Christine Hahn and Eric Mitchell. Leaving Berlin, originally for a long visit to Paris, Kippenberger spent the early 1980s as an active member of the Cologne art scene.\\nIn Cologne, as elsewhere, Kippenberger did not limit himself to producing works of art; he worked on how the art was presented, the framework and the sideshows. \"Martin was tremendously committed to the gallery\\'s artists,\" Max Hetzler said. The Vienna gallerist Peter Pakesch thinks Kippenberger did an enormous amount for the Hetzler Gallery\\'s success in his double role \"as clown and strategist... Max without Martin\\'s strategy would have been unimaginable in the early years.\" According to artist Jutta Koether, Kippenberger \"was the one who brought movement to life so that it became known outside Cologne.\"\\nIn 1984, he became a founding member of the Lord Jim Lodge. After moving to Los Angeles in late 1989, he bought a 35% share in ownership of the Italian restaurant Capri in Venice, Los Angeles. He stayed in Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald as a guest of the Grässlin family of art collectors from 1980 to 1981, and later on and off from 1991 to 1994, in order to work but also to recover from his excessive life. In his last years he taught at the Städelschule and the Kassel Art Academy.\\nMartin Kippenberger died at age 44 from liver cancer at the Vienna General Hospital.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nKippenberger’s refusal to adopt a specific style and medium in which to disseminate his images resulted in an extremely prolific and varied oeuvre which includes an amalgam of sculpture, paintings, works on paper, photographs, installations, prints and ephemera.\\nThroughout the 1980s, Kippenberger’s artwork underwent periods of strong political reflection. During a trip to Brazil in 1986, Kippenberger bought a gas station by the sea in Salvador de Bahia and renamed it the Martin Bormann Gas Station. With the fictionally acquired gas station, Kippenberger gave Martin Bormann a camouflage address and the possibility of an income in exile; Kippenberger allegedly installed a telephone line and employees were obliged to answer calls with ‘Tankstelle Martin Bormann’. Later accused of neo-Nazi attitudes by German critic Wolfgang Max Faust, he made several life-size, dressed mannequin sculptures of himself, called Martin, ab in die Ecke und schäm Dich (Martin, into the Corner, You Should Be Ashamed of Yourself) (1989), placed facing the wall.\\nKippenberger also felt that he was working in the face of a \\'perceived death of painting\\' and his art reflects his struggle with the concept that, at the turn of the millennium, it was impossible to produce anything original or authentic. Blass vor Neid steht er vor deiner Tür [Pale with Envy, He Stands Outside Your Door] (1981), for instance, comprises twenty-one individual canvases shown together as one work, but each canvas has a separate title and there is no consistent style. In 1987 he integrated a 1972, all-gray abstract painting by Gerhard Richter, which he himself had purchased, into the top of a coffee table. For the photorealist paintings from a series titled Lieber Maler, Male Mir or Dear Painter, Paint Me, Kippenberger hired a commercial painter named Werner to make them and signed them Werner Kippenberger. Untitled [The installation of the White Paintings] make formal reference to debates around language-based conceptual art as a critique of the ‘empty’ white cube gallery space. In a first series of works alluding to Picasso that were to follow in 1988, Kippenberger took this project further, looking to the ultimate Modern icon as a contemporary foil. Restaging a well-known photograph by David Douglas Duncan of Picasso standing in a \\'puffed-up\\' state of undress on the steps of Château Vauvenargues in 1962 Kippenberger was parodying his famous antecedent, playfully subverting the machismo associated with the genre of self-portraiture. First adopted as a motif in his 1988 series of self-portraits undertaken in Carmona, Spain, Kippenberger depicted himself with white briefs pulled up high over his exaggerated belly, as he turned to examine himself in a mirror.\\nKippenberger made the first of Laterne (Lamp) sculptures in 1988, a year that he spent largely living in Seville and Madrid in Spain. This work, Laterne an Betrunkene (\\'Street Lamp for Drunks\\') has become well known through its exhibition at the 1988 Venice Biennale. The original motif of the lamp sculptures derived in part from the photographs that filled Kippenberger\\'s 1988 artist\\'s book, \"Psychobuildings\".\\nIn 1989, Kippenberger and fellow artist Jeff Koons worked together on an issue of the art journal Parkett; the following year, Koons designed an exhibition poster for Kippenberger.\\nIn 1990, while sojourning in New York City, Kippenberger started a body of work collectively known as the Latex or Rubber paintings. Also in the 1990s, influenced by the Lost Art Movement, Kippenberger had the idea of an underground network encircling the whole world. Located on the Greek island of Syros and in Dawson City, Canada, false subway entrances are part of the Metro-Net World Connection series (1993–7) Kippenberger built as private commissions; a sizable length of subway grating, complete with the sounds of trains and gusts of wind, was exhibited posthumously at the Venice Biennale.\\nThe Happy End of Franz Kafka’s ‘Amerika’ (1994) explores the fictional utopia of universal employment, adapting Kafka’s idea of communal job interviews into an artwork. The installation consists of a diverse assortment of objects and furniture, assembled to suggest a playing field for conducting mass interviews. There are over 40 tables and twice as many chairs, from classics of twentieth-century design, such as chairs by Arne Jacobsen and Charles Eames, to worn-out tables bought in flea markets, remnants of previous Kippenberger exhibitions, and even work by other artists.\\nDuring the last 10 years of his life Kippenberger created a series of drawings on hotel stationery, which are commonly referred to as the \\'hotel drawings\\' (1987–1997). Originally undertaken as ad hoc preparatory diagrams for the three-dimensional Peter sculptures, he later used the myriad letterheads of innumerable hotels to capture other subjects and inspirations. Collected in his travels, Kippenberger conceived them in thematic series (portraits of scientists, portraits of Frank Sinatra, depictions of war etc.). His late collages incorporate photographs (Polaroids, film stills, magazine clips), prints (one by Sigmar Polke), exhibition posters from past Kippenberger shows, some folded up origami-style, self-produced decals, and photographed and rephotographed drawings. Executed in 1996 as part of the series, Untitled offers a depiction of Kippenberger standing side by side with his daughter Helena as a little girl.\\nIn the final two series, Kippenberger first can be seen posing like Picasso’s last wife, Jacqueline, subtitling the piece The Paintings Pablo Couldn’t Paint Anymore. In the complex of lithographs entitled Medusa (1996), Kippenberger used photography as his starting point although, this time, he himself posed for wife and photographer Elfie Semotan, mimicking the postures of the characters in the famous painting The Raft of the Medusa (1819) by Théodore Géricault (1791-1824).\\nIn 2011, Kippenberger\\'s When It Starts Dripping From the Ceiling was accidentally destroyed by a janitor in a Dortmund museum who believed she was cleaning stains off of the work.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1985, Kippenberger exhibited \"Buying America and Selling El Salvador\" at Metro Pictures Ltd in New York, a large installation comprising numerous sculptural works. Although he had his first museum exhibition at Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt in 1986, he drew greater attention from institutions outside Germany, with exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1993) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1994).\\nKippenberger\\'s artistic reputation and influence has grown since his death. In 2003, he represented Germany at the Venice Biennale (with Candida Höfer). He has since been the subject of several large retrospective exhibitions, including at the Tate Modern in 2006 and \"the Problem Perspective\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2008; the exhibition traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2009. In 2011, the Museo Picasso Malaga hosted \\'Kippenberger Meets Picasso\\'. This exhibition showed how Kippenbeger was interested in Pablo Picasso, an artistic attraction resulted in works, and entire series, that were direct references to the Spanish artist.\\nIn 2013 the newly founded Greek Organization for Culture and Development, NEON, presented the work of the German artist in the exhibition A Cry for Freedom, curated by Dimitris Paleocrassas at the Museum of Cycladic Art, in Athens, Greece with works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection and the Estate Martin Kippenberger, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne. The exhibition presented over 60 works including paintings, sculptures, hotel drawings and photographs, and is the first time that Kippenberger’s work will be displayed in a museum environment in Greece.\\n\\nKippenberger collected and commissioned work by many of his peers: some of his exhibition posters were designed by such prominent artists as Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Rosemarie Trockel and Mike Kelley.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nWhile Kippenberger\\'s star has risen steadily since his death, his market has evolved in several distinct stages. His work was only considered auction-worthy toward the very end of his life, and even then, it rarely sold for more than $10,000. Only in spring 2005 at Phillips de Pury & Company, an untitled 1991 painting sold for $1,024,000. In 2011, Kippenberger\\'s lamp sculpture Untitled (1990) was sold for £1,329,250 ($2,094,898) at Christie\\'s London.\\nKippenberger\\'s self-portraits have in the past achieved the highest prices. In 2012, an untitled self-portrait sold for £3.2 million ($5.1 million) at a Christie\\'s London Evening sale. In 2014, Kippenberger’s untitled 1988 self-portrait, restaging a photograph of the 81-year-old Picasso in his white underwear taken by David Douglas Duncan, fetched $18.6 million. Later that year, Larry Gagosian bought a 1988 self-portrait by Kippenberger, which shows the artist in his underwear, for $22.5 million at Christie\\'s in New York.\\nKippenberger is represented by Galerie Gisela Capitain, with representation by Skarstedt, New York in the United States. \\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nKippenberger\\'s art garnered some recognition in the mid-nineties when three pieces were used by Welsh alternative rock music group Manic Street Preachers as the cover artwork on the three singles released from their third album, The Holy Bible, in 1994: part four of the five-part Fliegender Tanga (\"Flying Tanga\"), which would be sold for £2,561,250 in 2010, was used for the first single \"Faster/P.C.P.\"; a 1983 piece, Sympatische Kommunistin (\"Nice Communist Woman\"), appeared on part one of the two-part single \"Revol\"; and, Titten, Türme, Tortellini (\"Tits, Towers, Tortellini\"), credited under its French title \"Des tètons, des tours, des tortellini\", was the cover artwork on both parts of the two-part, third single \"She Is Suffering\".\\nIn 2008, during an exhibition at the Museion in Bozen, Italy, a sculpture by Kippenberger depicting a toad being crucified called Zuerst die Füsse (\"First the Feet\") was condemned by Pope Benedict as blasphemous, despite the museum\\'s explanation that it was a \"self-portrait illustrating human angst\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nChristopher Kippenberger\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNew York Times obituary by Roberta Smith\\nHolland Cotter review of 2009 retrospective show at MOMA\\nSFMOMA Collection\\nPostmedia page\\nThe Saatchi Gallery - Martin Kippenberger, Gallery In London with images, information, text and biography about Martin Kippenberger\\nMartin Kippenberger on Artcyclopedia\\nTate Modern - Martin Kippenberger, retrospective 8 February 2006 – 14 May 2006\\nSkarstedt Gallery New York\\nCrucified frog controversy\\nGerman Crucified Frog Sculpture Angers Catholics in Italy\\nMartin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective / Museum of Modern Art MoMA New York, 2009\\nMartin Kippenberger Fan Shop\\nErik Bakke review of 2009 retrospective at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\\nMuseo Picasso Malaga exhibition on Kippenberger\\nLa mirada paseante: Kippenberger.

              "  'Julian Schnabel (born October 26, 1951) is an American painter and filmmaker. In the 1980s, he received international attention for his \"plate paintings\" — with broken ceramic plates set onto large-scale paintings. Since the 1990s, he has been a proponent of independent arthouse cinema. Schnabel directed Before Night Falls, which became Javier Bardem\\'s breakthrough Academy Award-nominated role, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was nominated for four Academy Awards. For the latter, he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as receiving nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and the César Award for Best Director.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nSchnabel was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family, the son of Esta (née Greenberg) and Jack Schnabel. He moved with his family to Brownsville, Texas in 1965. He received his B.F.A. at the University of Houston. After graduating, he sent an application to the Independent Study Program (ISP) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. His application included slides of his work sandwiched between two pieces of bread. He was admitted into the program and studied there from 1973 to 1975.\\nIn 1975, Schnabel visited Galveston and was introduced to the artist Joseph Glasco who had his home and studio in Galveston at that time.  Schnabel and Glasco became close friends and shared many similar interests in the arts. Later in their relationship, Schnabel influenced Glasco to set up his studio in New York, and in the late 1980s introduced Glasco to Leslie Waddington of Waddington Galleries, London where he had an exhibition.\\n\\n\\n=== Art career ===\\nSchnabel returned to Houston in 1975 and rented a studio in the Heights neighborhood. Jim Harithas, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, agreed to give him a show after Schnabel reportedly badgered him repeatedly. The eponymously titled exhibit ran from February 20 to March 7, 1976, in the parallelogram building\\'s lower gallery.\\nOn seeing the show, ARTnews critic Charlotte Moser wrote, \"Though still formative, Schnabel\\'s paintings possess a palpable presence,\" but found the work \"clearly influenced by post-minimalist artists whose intellectual ideas he might share but whose technical expertise and clarity of vision he has yet to acquire.\"\\nIt was with his first solo show, at the Mary Boone Gallery in 1979 that Schnabel had his breakthrough; all his works were sold in advance. He participated at the Venice Biennale in 1980 with Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. By the time he exhibited his work in a show jointly organized by Boone and Leo Castelli in 1981, he had become firmly established and was the youngest artist in the legendary exhibition \\'A New Spirit in Painting\\' in the Royal Academy of Arts. His now famous \"plate paintings\" — large-scale paintings set on broken ceramic plates—received a boisterous and critical reception from the art world. In 1984, he surprised the art community by moving from working with Mary Boone to exhibit at the Pace Gallery.\\nHis wild and expressive works were classed as neo-expressionism by art critics. In the years to follow Schnabel\\'s success on the art market would above all be criticised.\\nSchnabel\\'s style is characterised by very large scale paintings. He uses diverse materials such as plaster, wax, photographs, antlers, velvet and ceramics. His paintings make use of canvas, wood, muslin and even surfboards. His paintings often combine abstract and figurative elements. Due to the size, weight, and depth of his works, they are often given sculptural properties.\\nIn 2002, Schnabel painted the cover artwork for the Red Hot Chili Peppers\\' eighth studio album, By the Way. The woman featured on the cover of By the Way is Julian\\'s daughter, Stella Schnabel, who was band member John Frusciante\\'s then-girlfriend.[59] Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: \"My girlfriend\\'s father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn\\'t be offended if we didn\\'t like it, but we loved what he did. He\\'s also given us great covers for all the singles. He\\'s a true artist.\"\\nSchnabel had an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which ran from September 1, 2010 to January 2, 2011 and occupied the entirety of the gallery\\'s fifth floor. It examined \"the rich interplay between Schnabel\\'s paintings and films\". In 2011 Museo Correr exhibited Julian Schnabel: Permanently Becoming and the Architecture of Seeing, a selected survey show of Schnabel\\'s career curated by Norman Rosenthal.\\nArt critic Robert Hughes was one of the most outspoken critics of his work; he once stated that \"Schnabel\\'s work is to painting what Stallone\\'s is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals.\" In the 2017 Swedish film The Square, set in a museum of modern art, Dominic West plays a character modeled on Schnabel.\\n\\n\\n=== Film career ===\\nSchnabel began his film career in the 1990s with the film Basquiat, a biopic on the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat (1996), followed by Before Night Falls (2000), an adaptation of Reinaldo Arenas\\' autobiographical novel, which he also produced, and which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), an adaptation (with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood) of a French memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly earned him the award for best director at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Globe for best director, the Independent Spirit Award for best director, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.\\n\\nDespite the fact that producing The Diving Bell and the Butterfly might seem like a commission to do someone else\\'s work, Schnabel took on the film. According to Schnabel, I used to go up to read to Fred Hughes, Andy Warhol\\'s business partner, who had multiple sclerosis. And as Fred got worse, he ended up locked inside his body. I had been thinking that I might make a movie about Fred when his nurse, Darren McCormick, gave me Bauby\\'s memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Then, in 2003, when my father was dying, the script arrived from Kennedy. So it didn\\'t feel quite like taking on a commissioned job.\\nIn 2007, Schnabel designed Lou Reed\\'s critically acclaimed \"Berlin\" Tour and released Lou Reed\\'s Berlin. In 2010, Schnabel then directed the film Miral. In May 2017, Schnabel announced plans for a film about the painter Vincent van Gogh during his time in Arles and Auvers-sur-Oise, France. The film At Eternity\\'s Gate was released in 2018 and the script was written by Schnabel, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière, and Louise Kugelberg. The film stars Willem Dafoe as Van Gogh. Other actors include Mathieu Amalric, Mads Mikkelsen, Niels Arestrup, Oscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Emmanuelle Seigner as \"the woman from Arles\" or L\\'Arlésienne. \\nIn September 2023, Schnabel announced plans to direct an adaptation of In the Hand of Dante, based on the book by Nick Tosches. The movie will shoot October 2023 and is set to star Oscar Isaac.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing and recording ===\\nSchnabel published his autobiography, CVJ: Nicknames of Maitre D\\'s & Other Excerpts From Life (Random House, New York), in 1987 and released the album Every Silver Lining Has a Cloud on Island Records (Catalog #314-524 111-2) in 1995.\\nRecorded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1993, the album features guest musicians including Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Buckethead, and Nicky Skopelitis.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nIn 1980, he married Belgian clothing designer Jacqueline Beaurang. They have three children: two daughters – Lola, a painter and filmmaker; and Stella, a poet and actress – and a son, Vito, an art dealer.\\nHe has twin sons, Cy and Olmo, with his second wife, Spanish actress Olatz López Garmendia.\\nHis collaboration with Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal, who penned the screenplay and original source novel for Schnabel\\'s film Miral, extended beyond the movie. Schnabel was in a relationship with her from 2007 to 2011.\\nSchnabel dated Danish model May Andersen, from whom he parted ways in 2014. They have a son, who was born in June 2013.\\nSchnabel lives in New York City with his current wife Louise Kugelberg, a Swedish interior designer. She is also the co-editor and co-writer of At Eternity\\'s Gate. Schnabel maintains studios in New York City and in Montauk at the east end of Long Island. Schnabel resides in a former West Village horse stable that he purchased and converted for residential use, adding five luxury condominiums in the style of a Northern Italian palazzo. It is named the Palazzo Chupi, and it is easy to spot because it is painted pink.\\nIn 2009, Schnabel signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2019 Paez Medal of Art, New York City (VAEA).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBruno Bischofberger\\nList of artists who created paintings and drawings for use in films\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJulian Schnabel at IMDb',\n",
              "  'Marc Quinn (born 8 January 1964) is a British contemporary visual artist whose work includes sculpture, installation, and painting. Quinn explores \"what it is to be human in the world today\" through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, environment, and the media. His work has used materials that vary widely, from blood, bread and flowers, to marble and stainless steel. Quinn has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Sir John Soane\\'s Museum, the Tate Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Fondation Beyeler, Fondazione Prada, and South London Gallery. The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement.\\nQuinn is internationally celebrated and was awarded the commission for the first edition of the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2004, for which he exhibited Alison Lapper Pregnant. Quinn\\'s notorious frozen self-portrait series made of his own blood, Self (1991–present) was subject to a retrospective at Fondation Beyeler in 2009.\\nQuinn lives and works in London.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\nQuinn was born in London on 8 January 1964 to a French mother and a British father. He spent his early years in Paris, where his father was a physicist working at the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures). Quinn recalls an early fascination with the scientific instruments in his father\\'s laboratory, in particular atomic clocks. He attended Millfield (a private boarding-school in Somerset), and studied history and history of art at Robinson College, Cambridge.\\nIn the early 1990s, Quinn was the first artist to be represented by gallerist Jay Jopling. The artist had his first exhibition with Jopling in 1991, exhibiting Self (1991), a frozen self-portrait made out of nine pints of the artist\\'s blood.\\nDuring the 1990s, Quinn and several peers were identified for their radical approach to the making and experiencing of art. In 1992, the loosely affiliated group was called the \\'Young British Artists\\' by writer Michael Corris in Artforum, and included Cornelia Parker, Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin.\\nIn 1995, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Tate Britain where new sculptures were shown as part of the Art Now series. In 1997 Quinn\\'s work Self (1991), was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London for the exhibition Sensation. Quinn\\'s Self, along with works by Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, were already well known to the British public. The exhibition received widespread media attention and had a record number of visitors for a contemporary art exhibition. The exhibition then travelled to the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, and to the Brooklyn Museum, New York.\\nIn 1998, he was given a solo exhibition at the South London Gallery, and in 1999, he had a solo exhibition at Kunstverein Hannover. The Groninger Museum presented a solo exhibition of Quinn\\'s work in 2000. The artist was then invited to present a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2000, where he presented an ambitious new work Garden. In 2002, he was given a solo exhibition at Tate Liverpool which included new works and photography, and coincided with the Liverpool Biennial, where Quinn presented 1+1=3. In 2001, the National Portrait Gallery gave Quinn a solo exhibition for his genomic portrait of Sir John Sulston.\\nIn 2004 Quinn was awarded the first ever commission for the Fourth Plinth in London\\'s Trafalgar Square, for which he produced a marble sculpture of pregnant disabled artist, Alison Lapper.\\nIn 2006, Museo d\\'Arte Contemporanea Rome presented Marc Quinn\\'s works in a solo exhibition focused on his recent figurative sculpture, and in 2009, the Fondation Beyeler presented a solo exhibition of Marc Quinn\\'s ongoing series Self, including all sculptures from 1991 to 2006.\\nIn 2012, Quinn was commissioned to produce a monumental work for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games at the London Olympics 2012, for which he produced Breath, a monumental sculpture of Alison Lapper held up by air.\\nIn 2013, Quinn presented a solo exhibition on the occasion of the 55th Venice Biennale for art, at Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, curated by Germano Celant.\\nQuinn\\'s first monograph Memory Box by Germano Celant was published in 2013. A feature-length documentary about Quinn\\'s life and work, Making Waves, was released in 2014, produced and directed by Gerry Fox. London\\'s Somerset House presented a solo exhibition of Quinn in 2015, focusing on recent sculptures.\\nIn 2017, Marc Quinn staged a major exhibition at the Sir John Soane\\'s Museum in London. The exhibition was the first in a new series of collaborations with contemporary artists, designers, and architects, which, inspired by the spirit of Sir John Soane, sought to bring the collection to life in innovative ways.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nQuinn\\'s early work was concerned with issues of corporeality, decay, and preservation. He experimented with organic and degradable materials including bread, blood, lead, flowers and DNA producing sculpture and installation, including Bread Sculptures (1988), Self (1991), Emotional Detox (1995), Garden (2000), and DNA Portrait of John Sulston (2001). In the 2000s, he began to focus on the use of marble, bronze, and concrete. The artist explored the body and its extremes through the lens of classical and urban materials; works included The Complete Marbles (1999–2005), Alison Lapper Pregnant (2004), Evolution (2005–2009) and Planet (2008). Since 2010 he has worked with metals including stainless steel, aluminium, graffiti paints, seaside detritus, tapestry and painting, as seen in The History Paintings (2009–present) and The Toxic Sublime (2014–present).\\n\\n\\n== Early works: 1991–2000 ==\\n\\n\\n=== Self, 1991 – present ===\\nThe first work of Quinn\\'s to gain international fame was Self, which was exhibited in 1991, when he was 27. Self (1991) is a self-portrait formed by a frozen cast of 10 pints of the artist\\'s blood. It is an ongoing work, where the artist portrays himself every five years through a new cast with new blood.\\nThe artworks are placed in transparent plexiglass-glass boxes, on top of freezing cabinets. This highlights a theme of the works, which is dependency.\\nSelf (2006) is owned by the National Portrait Gallery, London.\\n\\n\\n=== Emotional Detox, 1995 ===\\nIn 1995 Quinn produced Emotional Detox, a series of seven sculptures made of lead and cast from the artist\\'s own body, were created at this time. Inspired by traditional iconography of the seven deadly sins, in each sculpture Quinn\\'s body is being torn apart and reconfigured, reflecting detoxification as both a physical and psychological battle.\\nEmotional Detox has been exhibited at Tate Britain, London (1995), Groninger Museum, The Netherlands (2000), and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2015).\\n\\n\\n=== Garden (2000) ===\\n\\nIn 2000, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada, Milan, which included his most ambitious works, involving organic matter. Garden is a 12-metre-long, 3-metre-high sculpture in which thousands of flowers are frozen in silicone oil. The work now belongs to the Fondazione Prada collection)\\n\\n\\n== Notable works: 2000–2010 ==\\n\\n\\n=== Portrait of John E. Sulston (2001) ===\\nQuinn\\'s portrait of John E. Sulston, who won the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2002 for sequencing the human genome on the Human Genome Project, is in the National Portrait Gallery. It consists of bacteria containing Sulston\\'s DNA in agar jelly. \"The portrait was made by our standard methods for DNA cloning\", writes Sulston. \"My DNA was broken randomly into segments, and treated so that they could be replicated in bacteria. The bacteria containing the DNA segments were spread out on agar jelly in the plate you see in the portrait.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Alison Lapper, The Fourth Plinth (2005–2007) ===\\nQuinn has made a series of marble sculptures of people either born with limbs missing or who have had them amputated. This culminated in his 15-ton marble statue of Alison Lapper, a fellow artist born with no arms and severely shortened legs, which was displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London from September 2005 until October 2007. (The Fourth Plinth is used for rotating displays of sculpture.) In Disability Studies Quarterly, Ann Millett writes, \"The work has been highly criticized for capitalizing on the shock value of disability, as well as lauded for its progressive social values. Alison Lapper Pregnant and the controversy surrounding it showcase disability issues at the forefront of current debates in contemporary art\".\\nA large reproduction of the sculpture was used as a central element of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== Sphinx (2006) and Siren (2008) ===\\n\\nSince 2006, Marc Quinn has made numerous studies of the supermodel Kate Moss. In April 2006, Sphinx, a sculpture of Kate Moss by Quinn, was revealed. The sculpture shows Moss in a yoga position with her ankles and arms wrapped behind her ears. This body of work culminated in an exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in May 2007. The sculpture is on permanent display in Folketeatret in Oslo, Norway.\\nIn August 2008, Quinn unveiled another sculpture of Moss in solid 18-carat gold called Siren, which was exhibited at the British Museum in London. The life-size sculpture was promoted as \"the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt\".\\n\\n\\n=== History Paintings (2009 – present) ===\\nIn 2009 Quinn began his \"History Paintings\" series which has continued to evolve.  The initial group of work in this effort were of enlarged press photos of conflicts around the world rendered into oil on canvas paintings or silk or wool jacquard tapestries.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works: 2010 – present ==\\n\\nIn May 2010, Quinn revealed a series of new sculptures at London\\'s White Cube gallery including The Ecstatic Autogenesis of Pamela based on film actress Pamela Anderson and Chelsea Charms based on pornography model Chelsea Charms.\\nQuinn\\'s models have included \"Catman\" Dennis Avner (who has been tattooed to look like a cat) and transgender people such as Thomas Beatie, Buck Angel, and Allanah Starr. Quinn\\'s portrait sculpture \"Buck & Allanah\" depicts the two nude, standing hand in hand, in a pose reminiscent of Adam and Eve. The sculpture of Thomas Beatie depicts him at full-term pregnancy, bowing his head and cradling his abdomen with two hands.\\nThe exhibition also included a new series of flower paintings executed in reversed colour and two large-scale orchid sculptures in white painted bronze, installed in Hoxton Square, opposite the gallery.\\n\\n\\n=== The Toxic Sublime (2015) ===\\nIn 2015 Marc Quinn opened an exhibition of new work at White Cube Bermondsey, entitled The Toxic Sublime. It featured new bodies of work that explore the ecological impact of man on nature. ‘The Toxic Sublimes’ are distorted, three dimensional seascapes. Alongside these paintings, a new series of sculptures, cast in stainless steel, including one measuring over 7.5 meters long, form part of a body of work titled Frozen Waves. The sculptures originate from the core of shells, eroded by the endless action of waves.\\n\\n\\n=== All About Love (2016–2017) ===\\nIn 2017, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Sir John Soane\\'s Museum in London. A display of 12 life-cast sculptures, the All About Love series explore the notion of love through the expression of classical fragmented sculpture. Created in collaboration with his partner at the time, the sculptures, which depict the two embracing one another, are works that echo sculptures of many periods from the Renaissance to Auguste Rodin.\\n\\n\\n=== A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 ===\\n\\nThe sculpture A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 was erected secretly in Bristol in the early morning of 15 July 2020; it is Quinn\\'s statue of Black Lives Matter protester, Jen Reid. The statue was mounted on the plinth which formerly held a 19th-century statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol merchant, philanthropist, and Tory Member of Parliament (MP) who had been involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Just over 24 hours after the statue was installed, the Bristol City Council had it taken down as it did not have permission to be installed. The Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, invited Quinn to make a contribution towards the cost to the council of having his statue removed.\\n\\n\\n=== Viral Paintings (2020) ===\\nThis currently ongoing series of paintings by Quinn are of paint splattered over blown up screen shots of photos and news stories of current events taken on his cell phone and created during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  These new works are considered a continuation of his  History Painting series begun in 2009.\\n\\n\\n== Charity auctions ==\\nQuinn has participated in a number of charity auctions since 2010. His work was auctioned for the UK\\'s homelessness charity, Crisis, in collaboration with Vogue at Christie\\'s in 2010. In 2013, he donated work to the Mimi Foundation charity for cancer auction at Sotheby\\'s. He donated work to the charity auction for Peace One Day at Bonhams, curated by Jake Chapman, in 2014 and 2015.\\nIn 2013 Quinn was commissioned to make a work for RHS Chelsea Flower Show, marking the first time an artist collaborated with the flower show in its 100-year history. The Rush of Nature (2013) was auctioned at Sotheby’s to help raise money for RHS Chelsea Centenary Appeal.\\nWork by Quinn was auctioned at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation annual St. Tropez Gala in 2016, supporting environmental protection.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\nThe work of the artist is held, among others, in the following public collections:\\n\\nAstrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo\\nBerardo Collection Museum, Lisbon\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\\nMusée d\\'art contemporain de Montréal\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Paris\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nNational Portrait Gallery, London\\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\\nTate Modern, London\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website',\n",
              "  'Boris Andreyevich Mikhailov or Borys Andriyovych Mykhailov (Ukrainian: Бори́с Андрі́йович Миха́йлов; born 25 August 1938) is a Ukrainian photographer. He has been awarded the Hasselblad Award and the Citibank Private Bank Photography Prize.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nMykhailov was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine. He received an education as an engineer and started to teach himself photography. He had a four-decade career as a Soviet factory photographer. His work combines conceptual art and social documentary photography.\\nMikhailov had his first exhibition at the end of the 1960s. After the KGB found nude pictures of his wife he was laid off his job as an engineer and started to work full-time as a photographer. From 1968 to 1975 he shot several series documenting everyday scenes, the best known of them being the Red series. In these photographs he mainly used the colour red, to picture people, groups and city-life. Red symbolized the October Revolution, political party and the social system of Soviet society. According to Sabina Jaskot-Gill for Tate, \"By drawing attention to the inescapable presence of the colour in the Ukrainian social landscape, the series suggests the extent to which communist ideology had permeated all aspects of Soviet life.\"\\nIn Mykhailov\\'s Klebrigkeit (1982), he added explanatory notes, or diary-like text.\\nIn Case History, he examines the consequences of the breakdown of the Soviet Union for its people. He systematically took pictures of homeless people. It shows the situation of people who after the breakdown of the Soviet Union were not able to find their place in a secure social system. In a very direct way Mykhailov points out his critique against the \"mask of beauty\" of the emerging post-Soviet capitalistic way of life.\\nIn 2004 Mykhailov first exhibited in Berlin in an exhibition concerning people living at the edge of society. He subsequently moved from Ukraine to Germany, where he resides as of 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nIf I were a German. Dresden: Verlag der Kunst Dresden, 1995.

              "  \"Robert Mangold (born October 12, 1937) is an American minimalist artist. He is also father of film director and screenwriter James Mangold.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nMangold was born in North Tonawanda, New York. His mother, Blanche, was a department store buyer, and his father, Aloysius Mangold, worked at an organ factory. He first trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art from 1956 to 1959, and then at Yale University, New Haven, (BFA, 1961; MFA, 1963).\\nIn 1961 he married Sylvia Plimack, and they moved to New York. In the summer of 1962 Mangold was hired as  guard at the Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n“Robert Mangold’s paintings,” wrote Michael Kimmelman in The New York Times in 1997, “are more complicated to describe than they seem, which is partly what’s good about them: the way they invite intense scrutiny, which, in the nature of good art, is its own reward.”  His works are comprised often of simple elements which are put together through complex means. Mangold's work challenges the typical connotations of what a painting is or could be, and his works often appear as objects rather than images. Elements refer often to architectural elements or have the feeling of an architect's hands. He almost always works in extensive series, often carried through both paintings and works on paper.\\nMangold's early work consisted largely of monochromatic free-standing constructions displayed against the wall, such as Grey Window Wall (1964). In 1968 he began employing acrylic instead of oil paint, rolling rather than spraying it on Masonite or plywood grounds. Within the year, he moved from these more industrially oriented supports to canvas. In 1970 he began working with shaped canvases and within the year began brushing rather than spraying paint onto canvas. By the mid-1970s, Mangold moved on to overlapping shapes whose contours are formed by combinations of canvas edges and both drawn and implied lines.  A Rectangle and a Circle within a Square from 1975, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of these subtle geometric relationships.\\nA 1994 series consisted of monochrome panels, deployed in two-panel trapezoidal works whose colors, sometimes matching, sometimes contrasting, run to deep oranges, olive greens, browns and grays. In a 2006/7 series, entitled Column Structure I through Column Structure XII, the 12 canvases each have a central vertical trunk measuring 10 feet high and 2 feet wide that is subdivided by straight, horizontal lines and appended with squares or triangles that jut from the sides, usually near the top.\\nIn a 1994 review in Art in America, Robert Kushner wrote that “underneath the composure of their execution, there is an almost romantic vividness of experience. The contrast of this veiled undercurrent and the Apollonian restraint of the presentation make these new paintings both powerful and poignant.”\\nMangold made his first prints in 1972 at Crown Point Press and has made prints throughout his career, working with Pace Editions and Brooke Alexander Editions. He designed the monumental colored glass panels contained in the Buffalo Federal Courthouse pavilion lobby.\\nMangold lives in Washingtonville, New York with his wife, Sylvia, who is also an artist. They are the parents of film director/screenwriter James Mangold and musician Andrew Mangold.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nIn 1965, the Jewish Museum in New York held the first major exhibition of what was called Minimal art and included Robert Mangold. In 1967, he won a National Endowment for the Arts grant and in 1969, a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1971, he had his first solo museum exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum.\\nMajor museum exhibitions of his work have since been held the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (1974), the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1982), Hallen für Neue Kunst in Schaffhausen (1993), and Musée d’Orsay in Paris (2006). He has been featured in the Whitney Biennial four times, in 1979, 1983, 1985, and 2004.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\n\\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, the Bonnefantenmuseum (Maastricht, Netherlands), Fundacío La Caixa (Barcelona), the Hallen für Neue Kunst (Schaffhausen, Switzerland), the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington, DC), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Trust (Los Angeles), the Kunstmuseum Basel (Switzerland), the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (Madrid), the Museum of Modern Art (New York City, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R.

              "  'Robert Longo (born January 7, 1953) is an American artist, filmmaker, photographer and musician.\\nLongo became first well known in the 1980s for his Men in the Cities drawing and print series, which depict sharply dressed men and women writhing in contorted emotion. He lives in New York and East Hampton.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nLongo was born in 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Long Island. He had a childhood fascination with mass media: movies, television, magazines, and comic books, which continue to influence his art.\\nLongo began college at the University of North Texas, in the town of Denton, but left before getting a degree. He later studied sculpture under Leonda Finke, who encouraged him to pursue a career in the visual arts. In 1972, Longo received a grant to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy. Upon his return to New York, Longo enrolled at Buffalo State College, where he received a BFA in 1975. While at Buffalo State, he studied under, and was likely influenced by art professor Joseph Piccillo. At this time he was associated with artist Cindy Sherman, who was also studying art at Buffalo State.\\nWhile in college, Longo and his friends established an avant garde art gallery in their co-op building, the Essex Art Center, which was originally a converted ice factory; the gallery became Hallwalls Contemporary Art Center. Through his gallery efforts, Longo met many local and New York City artists and eventually moved to New York City to participate in the art scene of the late-1970s, for example with the artists and critics involved with the journal Effects: Magazine for New Art Theory.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Drawing ===\\nAlthough he studied sculpture, drawing remained Longo\\'s favorite form of self-expression. However, the sculptural influence pervades his drawing technique, as Longo\\'s \"portraits\" have a distinctive chiseled line that seems to give the drawings a three-dimensional quality. Longo uses graphite like clay, molding it to create images like the writhing, dancing figures in his seminal Men in the Cities series. For that series, Longo photographed his friends lurching backward, collapsing forward or sprawled on invisible pavement. After enlarging the pictures through a projector, he and an artist assistant drew them in sizes ranging from three-quarter scale to larger than life-size. In the process, Longo often dramatized poses and always standardized attire into quite formal, black-and-white clothing. The idea for this work came, in 1975, from a still image in Rainer Werner Fassbinder\\'s film The American Soldier. According to art critic William Wilson of the Los Angeles Times, the pictures recall nothing so much as the final scene in Ingmar Bergman\\'s The Seventh Seal. About four years passed before Longo turned the vision of a man shot in the back into a monumental series of drawings. He produced about 60 Men in the Cities between 1979 and 1982. One drawing from this series was used as the album cover to Glenn Branca\\'s album The Ascension. As a consequence, in his 30s, Longo was among the most widely publicized, exhibited and collected artists of the 1980s along with the likes of Cindy Sherman and David Salle. However, several critics have commented that Longo had lost his way as a visual artist by the mid-\\'80s.\\nWorking on themes of power and authority, Longo produced a series of blackened American flags (\"Black Flags\" 1989–91) as well as oversized hand guns (Bodyhammers 1993–95).  From 1995 to 1996 he worked on his Magellan project, 366 drawings (one per day) that formed an archive of the artist\\'s life and surrounding cultural images. \"Magellan\" was followed by 2002\\'s Freud Drawings, which reinterpreted Edmund Engelman\\'s famous documentary images of Sigmund Freud\\'s flat, moments before his flight from the Nazis. In 2002 and 2004 he presented Monsters, Bernini-esque renderings of massive breaking waves and The Sickness of Reason, baroque renderings of atomic bomb blasts. Monsters was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial.\\nTo create works such as Barbara and Ralph, Longo projects photographs of his subjects onto paper and traces the figures in graphite, removing all details of the background. After he records the basic contours, his long-time illustrator, Diane Shea, works on the figure for about a week, filling in the details. Next, Longo goes back into the drawing, using graphite and charcoal to provide \"all the cosmetic work\". Longo continues to work on the drawing, making numerous adjustments until it is completed about a week later.\\nIn March 2013, The Lexander Magazine reviewed Longo\\'s 1982–83 diptych entitled Pressure, highlighting it as the \"penultimate visual anthem of the era,\" expanding upon Neal Benezra\\'s 1988 analysis of the work as having been \"the most representative work of art of the 1980s.\"\\nThe artist\\'s Engines of State series (made between 2012 and 2019) was given to the National Gallery of Art in 2023 by Clifford Ross.\\n\\n\\n=== Music videos ===\\nIn the 1980s, Longo directed several music videos, including New Order\\'s \"Bizarre Love Triangle\", Megadeth\\'s \"Peace Sells\" and \"The One I Love\" by R.E.M. He is responsible for the front covers of Glenn Branca\\'s The Ascension from 1981 and The Replacements\\' 1985 album Tim.\\n\\n\\n=== Film and television ===\\nIn 1992, Longo directed an episode of Tales from the Crypt entitled \"This\\'ll Kill Ya\". He also directed the cyberpunk film Johnny Mnemonic, starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and a short film named Arena Brains. At the time, Longo was quoted as saying, \"making a painting is one thing, but making a film kicks your ass.\" During the late 1980s and early 1990s Longo developed a number of performance art theatre pieces, such as Marble Fog and Killing Angels, collaborating with Stuart Argabright, the guitarist Chuck Hammer and Douglas Sloan.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nLongo was the leader and guitarist of a musical act called Robert Longo\\'s Menthol Wars, which performed no wave experimental music in New York rock clubs in the late 1970s, such as Tier 3. Members of the band included Richard Prince and David Linton. Menthol Wars also was part of a series of three staple-bound paperback books by Richard Prince published during 1980 by Printed Matter, Inc..  \\nDuring the same period, Longo also performed with Rhys Chatham in Chatham\\'s Guitar Trio and produced a series of slowly fading slides entitled Pictures for Music which was projected behind the musicians.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nCommissioned by Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta, Longo photographed models Terron Wood and Alla K for the brand\\'s fall/winter 2010 advertisements, evoking memories of the dancing silhouettes of his Men in the Cities series.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nLongo has had retrospective exhibitions at Hamburger Kunstverein and Deichtorhallen, Menil Collection in Houston, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1989, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago in 1990, Hartford Athenaeum, The Isetan Museum of Art in Tokyo, and a Survey Exhibition 1980–2009, at Musée d\\'art moderne et d\\'art contemporain in Nice France in 2009 and at Museu Colecção Berardo in Lisbon, Portugal in 2010.\\nGroup exhibitions include Documenta VIII, the Whitney Biennial, and the Venice Biennale. His photorealistic charcoal drawings were featured in the exhibition Proof at the Brooklyn Museum in 2017 alongside works by Francisco Goya and Sergei Eisenstein.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\nLongo\\'s work from the Men in the Cities series was prominently displayed in the apartment of fictional character Patrick Bateman in the film American Psycho (2000).\\nIn 2013, Longo\\'s artwork was featured in an article in the men\\'s magazine, Man of the World along with an article discussing his life and career.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nLongo is represented by Pace Gallery (since 2021) and Thaddaeus Ropac.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nLongo lived with artist Cindy Sherman from 1974 to 1980. He lived with artist Gretchen Bender from 1981 to 1989. Longo married German actress Barbara Sukowa in 1994. Together they have three sons: Hans Longo, Viktor Longo, and Joseph Longo.\\nLongo moved to Europe in 1990, living for a few years in Paris and working in Spain and Germany. He lives in New York and East Hampton.\\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Guild Hall of East Hampton to cancel its 2021 summer gala and auction, Longo volunteered to postpone his own summer exhibition at the space and spearhead a $1 million benefit show in its stead.\\n\\n\\n== Literature ==\\nHeinz-Norbert Jocks: Robert Longo.

              "  'Anya Gallaccio (born 1963) is a British artist, who creates site-specific, minimalist installations and often works with organic matter (including chocolate, sugar, flowers and ice).\\nHer use of organic materials results in natural processes of transformation and decay, meaning that Gallaccio is unable to predict the result of her installations. Something which at the start of an exhibition may be pleasurable, such as the scent of flowers or chocolate, would inevitably become increasingly unpleasant over time. The timely and site-specific nature of her work makes it notoriously difficult to document. Her work therefore challenges the traditional notion that an art object or sculpture should essentially be a monument within a museum or gallery. Instead her work often lives through the memory of those that saw and experienced it – or the concept of the artwork itself.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBorn in Paisley, Scotland, to TV producer George Gallaccio and actress Maureen Morris. She grew up in south west London, England and studied at Kingston Polytechnic (1984–85) and Goldsmiths College (1985–88). In 1988 Gallaccio exhibited in the Damien Hirst-curated Freeze exhibition, and in 1990 the Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas organised East Country Yard shows, which brought together many of the Young British Artists. Gallaccio is a professor in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nGallaccio is known for producing site-specific works that inhale the prescribed climate and space. She often collaborates closely with nature when selecting materials, exploring life cycles through the passage of time, memory, and loss. Much of her work uses organic materials, with fruit, vegetables and flowers all featuring in her work. Sometimes these materials undergo a change during the course of being exhibited.\\nIn Red on Green (1992), her first solo showing at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, ten thousand rose heads placed on a bed of their stalks gradually withered as the exhibition went on. For Intensities and Surfaces (1996) Gallaccio left a thirty-two ton block of ice with a salt core in the disused pumping station at Wapping and allowed it to melt.\\npreserve \\'beauty\\'  1991–2003 was an artwork which Gallaccio produced as a nominee for the 2003 Turner Prize. The installation consisted of a wall of gerbera daisies pinned behind a single sheet of glass. Behind glass, the flowers recall still-life and romantic landscape paintings, as well as flower arranging and pressing.\\nOther works by Gallaccio include Stroke (1993) in which benches in the gallery and cardboard panels attached to the walls were covered in chocolate, \\n\"Two Hundred Kilos of Apples Tied to a Barren Apple Tree\", Atelier Amden, Amden, Switzerland (1999) and Because Nothing has Changed (2000), a bronze sculpture of a tree adorned with porcelain apples. Because I Could Not Stop (2002) is a similar bronze tree but with real apples which are left to rot.\\nRed on Green was recreated ten years later for the exhibition Blast to Freeze: British Art in the 20th Century mounted by Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in 2002–2003 and for the 2004 British Council exhibition Turning Points: 20th Century British Sculpture.\\nIn Stoke (2004), Gallaccio coated an old farm building at Edinburgh\\'s Jupiter Artland with almost 90 pounds of 70 percent cocoa, confectioner-quality chocolate. The work invited visitors to lick, touch, and stroke the walls.\\n2005 saw the publication of Anya Gallaccio: Silver Seed by Ridinghouse, which accompanied the artist\\'s exhibition commissioned by the Mount Stuart Trust for an installation at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, UK.\\nAt Houghton Hall in Norfolk, the Marquess of Cholmondeley commissioned a folly to the east of the great house. \"The Sybil Hedge\" is an \"artlandish\" folly. It is based on the signature of the marquis\\' grandmother, Sybil Sassoon.  Gallaccio has created a sarcophagus-like marble structure which is sited at the end of a path; and nearby is a copper-beech hedge which is planted in lines mirroring Sybil\\'s signature.\\nCommissioned for The Whitworth Art Gallery, Untitled (2016), dubbed the ‘ghost tree’, investigates themes of life, death and nature. Inspired by the removal of a decaying tree, Gallaccio worked from digital scans of the removed tree, later reproducing in ribbons of complex stainless steel plates, a monumental and reflective \\'ghost tree\\'. It has become \"a haunting response to loss and a timeless monument to nature.\"\\nIn a 2018 interview with Ocula, Gallaccio remarked of the YBA breakout exhibition Freeze: \"It feels just as precarious now as it did then. And I think it is good to constantly remind myself of that and not to get complacent. The bravado and the chutzpah of Freeze was impressive; it was more about a kind of attitude and that is something that has had reverberations.\"\\n\\n\\n== Awards and acknowledgements ==\\nIn 2006, she was listed on the Pink Power list of 100 most influential gay and lesbian people of 2006.\\nIn 2003, Gallaccio was shortlisted for the Turner Prize alongside Grayson Perry, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Willie Doherty. One of her pieces for the show was preserve \"beauty\", 1991–2003, which was made from glass, fixings and 2,000 red gerberas.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nThe Light Pours Out of Me, Jupiter Artland, Edinburgh, UK\\nFreeze, Surrey Docks, London, UK \\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nimages of Gallaccio\\'s work at Lehmann Maupin',\n",
              "  'Josephine Gail Baer (née Josephine Gail Kleinberg; born August 7, 1929) is an American painter associated with minimalist art. She began exhibiting her work at the Fischbach Gallery, New York, and other venues for contemporary art in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, she turned away from non-objective painting. Since then, Baer has fused images, symbols, words, and phrases in a non-narrative manner, a mode of expression she once termed \"radical figuration.\" She lives and works in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and work, 1929–1960 ==\\nJosephine Gail Kleinberg was born on August 7, 1929, in Seattle, Washington. Her mother, Hortense Kalisher Kleinberg, was a commercial artist and a fierce proponent of women\\'s rights who imbued her daughter with a sense of independence.  Her father, Lester Kleinberg, was a successful commodities broker in hay and grain.  Baer studied art as a child at the Cornish College of the Arts, but because her mother wanted her to become a medical illustrator, she majored in biology at the University of Washington in Seattle, which she attended from 1946 to 1949. She dropped out of school in her junior year to marry a fellow-student at the university, Gerard L. Hanauer.\\nThe marriage was over quickly, and in 1950, Baer went to Israel to explore the realities of rural socialism on various kibbutzim for a few months. Returning to New York City,  from 1950 to 1953 she did the course  work for a master\\'s degree in psychology at The New School for Social Research. Baer went to school at night, while during the day she was employed by an interior design studio as a draftsperson and secretary.\\nBaer moved to Los Angeles in 1953 and shortly afterwards married Richard Baer, a television writer. Their son, Joshua Baer, who became an art dealer, writer, and consultant, was born in 1955; the couple was divorced in the late 1950s.  During this time Baer began to paint and draw for the first time since adolescence, becoming friends with Edward Kienholz and other local artists in the orbit of the Ferus Gallery. She met the painter John Wesley, to whom she was married from 1960 to 1970.  She, Wesley, and Joshua moved to New York in 1960, where Baer lived until 1975. After separating from Wesley, she was in a long-term relationship with the sculptor Robert Lawrance Lobe.\\nBaer\\'s work of the late 1950s explored visual elements that paralleled members of the New York School, particularly Arshile Gorky, Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, and Mark Rothko.  Rothko, she observed, \"gave me permission to work with a format.\" Jasper Johns\\'s paintings and sculpture also made an immediate impression, because they suggested \"how a work should be the thing itself.\"\\n\\n\\n== Life and career, 1960–1975 ==\\n\\n\\n=== Paintings and exhibitions ===\\n\\nIn 1960 Baer rejected Abstract Expressionism for spare, hard-edge non-objective painting. Two early important paintings in this style were Untitled (Black Star) (1960-1961; Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo) and Untitled (White Star) (1960-1961; Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo). She then introduced an even more pared-down format:  the image was excised and the central area of the canvas became completely white.   In 1962 Baer began the Korean series, a group of sixteen canvases.  The Koreans were given their name by the art dealer Richard Bellamy, who said that Baer\\'s paintings were just as unknown as Korean art was to most Westerners. The Koreans were composed of a dominant field of densely painted white enclosed by bands of sky blue and black that seem to shimmer and move:  this optical illusion underscored Baer\\'s focus on \"the notion of light.\" Baer ascribed her inspiration for the Koreans to Samuel Beckett\\'s novel The Unnamable, which she was reading at the time. His observations about osmosis and diffusion through membranes influenced her to examine the properties of boundaries between spaces. In many works that Baer created between 1964 and 1966, the peripheries and edges of the canvas continued to be marked by two square or rectangular bands of color.  The outer, thicker border was black; inside it, a thinner band was painted in another color, such as red, green, lavender, or blue. Baer summed up the artistic concerns of her own work in 1971, writing, \"Non-objective painting\\'s language is rooted, nowadays, in edges and boundaries, contours and gradients, brightness, darkness and color reflections. Its syntax is motion and change.\"\\nBaer was accepted as a peer in the burgeoning Minimalist movement by such artists as Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, and Dan Flavin. In 1964 Flavin organized \"Eleven Artists,\" an exhibition that was an important step in defining the key figures of Minimalism. He included Baer, along with Judd, Flavin, LeWitt, Ward Jackson, Frank Stella, Irwin Fleminger, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Robert Ryman, Leo Valledor, and himself. In 1966 Baer\\'s first one-person show took place at the Fischbach Gallery, then a center for avant-garde art. That year she was also represented in both \"Systemic Painting,\" a survey exhibition of contemporary geometric abstraction at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. She also participated in \"10,\" a group exhibition at the Virginia Dwan Gallery co-curated by Ad Reinhardt and Robert Smithson that further enshrined its participants as canonical for Minimalism.  Besides Baer, Reinhardt, and Smithson, the other artists selected were Carl Andre, Judd, LeWitt, Flavin, Robert Morris, Michael Steiner, and Agnes Martin. Baer\\'s works shown in these exhibitions, which included vertical and horizontal single, diptych, and triptych paintings, established her avant-garde reputation in the New York art world.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s, Baer was experimenting with color and shifting the visual focus of her work. While working on the series The Stations of the Spectrum (1967-1969), Baer painted over their white surfaces to make them gray. She then turned them into triptychs because she saw that these paintings had more wall power when they were hung together. Next, as she said, \"I wanted to know what happens around a corner – that interested me as an optical thing.\" The result was the Wraparound paintings, where-in which Baer painted thick black bands edged by blues, greens, oranges, and lavenders that went around the sides of the canvas – areas that artists customarily ignore, overlook, or cover with a frame. More than ever, the action was at the edges: \"Sensation,\" Baer wrote, \"is the edge of things.  Where there are no edges, there are no places—a uniform visual field quickly disappears.\"  Further challenging the notion of where a painting begins or ends, Baer added sweeping diagonal and curved paths of color that streaked across her once-inviolate white fields and down the sides of the canvas.  These canvases bore titles like H. Arcuata (1971; coll. Daimler Corporation, Zurich) and V. Lurida (1971, Levi-Strauss Collection, San Francisco).  The titles were orotund flights of fancy – they identified fictitious specious of plants that she extrapolated from a book of botanical Latin she owned.  (Baer was cultivating prize-winning orchids in the late 1960s, and became an expert on growing them inside an urban loft.)  When translated into English, Baer\\'s Latinate letters and words have nothing to do with flowers; instead, they are visual descriptions masquerading as scientific diction. \"H.\" stands for \"horizontal\" and \"V.\" for \"vertical.\" \"Arcuata\" means curved, and \"lurida\" means \"pale\" or \"shining.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Writings ===\\nBaer was an active writer during her years in New York.  In letters to editors, articles, and statements in art magazines, she defended the integrity and continuing importance of painting from attacks on it by Minimalist sculptors, who insisted that it had become an irrelevant art form that should be renounced in favor of the production of three-dimensional objects. Because she publicly questioned the tenets of a powerful pantheon of artists that included Judd and Morris, Baer was ostracized by a number of her former colleagues.\\n\\nAmong Baer\\'s most ambitious essays, for she which was able to employ her scientific training, was \"Art & Vision:  Mach Bands,\" published in 1970. She tackled the physics and psychology of visual perception in her discussion of Mach bands, an optical illusion named after Ernest Mach, a nineteenth-century physicist who discovered that light-dark contrasts will intensify when opposing colors are placed next to each other:  light areas will appear lighter and dark areas will seem darker.  She linked this investigation into subjective sensations of the beholder to how edges, boundaries, and contours are experienced in modern art.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career, 1975–present ==\\nIn 1975 Baer was the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, showcasing her Minimalist work.  However, Baer reached an impasse with non-objective painting.  Sensing that her format had become a formula, she could go no further with it.  Two transitional canvases –-  M. Refractarius (1974–75; private collection, Paris) and The Old Year (1974–75; private collection, United States) – record her desire to break away from Minimalism.\\nBaer needed a distance from New York\\'s art world, and in June 1975 she moved to Smarmore Castle, a manor and working farm with a Norman keep, in County Louth, Ireland.\\nIn this new environment, the reality of horses, birds and other animals as well as the ways of country people informed her paintings.  She began to paint quasi-figuratively, layering fragments of images of animal, human bodies and objects in muted, translucent colors. Baer also drew on erotic images found in early cave paintings, Paleolithic sculptures and fertility objects to create compositions that suggested palimpsests.\\n\\nIn 1977 Baer had a one-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and during the course of it she met the British artist Bruce Robbins.  The two lived and worked together from 1978 to 1984, first in Ireland and then from 1982 to 1984 in London, creating paintings, drawings, and texts. Their collaborations were shown in eight two-person exhibitions. While in London, Baer wrote one of her best-known articles, \"I am no longer an abstract artist,\" a manifesto published in Art in America  in October 1983. Baer chronicled \"abstraction\\'s demise,\" and in characterizing its meaninglessness in a vastly changed world, claimed openness, ambiguity, \"metaphor, symbolism, and hierarchical relationships\" as necessary building blocks of modern works. Baer announced that she and Robbins were working toward a \"radical figuration\" based on those constructs.  \\n\\n \\nIn 1984, Baer moved by herself to Amsterdam, where she has lived ever since. In the 1990s Baer\\'s paintings became, in her words, \"more declarative,\" with richer colors, sharper light-dark contrasts, and more ambitious cultural and social criticism. Disparate images and symbols from American, European, Asian, and classical civilizations are fused with quotations from literature and densely layered allusions to the themes of war, sexuality, the destruction of the natural world, greed, injustice, repression, transience, and death. Two paintings in this style are Shrine of the Piggies (The Pigs Hog it All and Defacate and Piss on Where From They Get It and With Whom They Will Not Share. That s It) (2000) and Testament of the Powers That Be (Where Trees Turn to Sand, Residual Colours Stain the Lands) (2001).\\nBaer has also painted several autobiographical meditations on her own life, most notably Altar of the Egos (Through a Glass Darkly), (2004; collection Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo), Memorial for an Art World Body (Nevermore) (2009; collection of the artist), and a series of 6 works slated for exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in 2013, provisionally titled In the Land of the Giants (2011; collection of the artist). Baer\\'s writings over the years were brought together in Broadsides & Belles Lettres: Selected Writings and Interviews 1965–2010, which provide a general commentary on art as well as her own attitudes to her work.\\nSubsequent surveys of her work have been organized by The Paley Levy Gallery at Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia (1993); Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo (1993); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1999); Dia Center for the Arts, New York (2002-2003);  Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, (1986 and 2009); Galerie Barbara Thumm, Berlin (2010); and Gagosian Gallery, Geneva (2012). In 2013 two one-person shows were running parallel: \"In the Land of the Giants\" at Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam and \"Jo Baer. Gemälde und Zeichnungen seit 1960 (Drawings and Paintings)\" at Ludwig Museum, Cologne. Baer\\'s work was also included in the 2017 Whitney Biennial\\n\\n\\n== Texts by Baer ==\\n\"Statements.\" Systemic Painting. The Solomon R.

              "  \"Susan Hauptman (1947–2015) was an American artist who worked exclusively on paper with charcoal, pastel, and later, other elements such as gold leaf, wire mesh, and thread. She is best known for her stark, enigmatic, often expressionless self-portraits in which she depicted herself with precise and candid detail. Critics described her works as strikingly androgynous and confrontational toward cultural notions of beauty, reality, femininity, and masculinity. Hauptman's exhibitions were held at several esteemed institutions, including the Norton Gallery of Art, West Palm Beach, FL; the Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Jeremy Stone Gallery. Her works at the Jeremy Stone Gallery further cemented her reputation for challenging traditional gender representations through art.\\nHer later still lifes were of porcelain figures and fruit-box-type labels, fanciful and often romantic. They are thought to be narrative.\\nSusan Hauptman's self is drawn both life-scale and larger-than-life. She draws close to a traditional definition of drawing, where the drawing fundamentals of value, tone, shading, composition and, to a lesser extent, line, are formal elements within each work, modulations of elemental light and shadow. These fundamentals are transformed by her— the artist as alchemist.  Her work transcends its materiality in and as drawing, offering us both the noun and verb of drawing, until we are presented with seemingly autonomous, illusionistic imaginative drawings, moments in an overarching narrative.\\n\\nHauptman's self-portraits offer complex folds, twists and turns in thinking through the inside out of representation, because it is difficult not to be seduced by the astonishing surfaces of the works into believing the illusion of likeness…,or taking for granted the mimetic imaging of the artist beyond the frame… the image and imagined.\\nHer subjective elements, her selves perform endlessly, they constitute the limits of sexual difference…objecthood as a paradox… real against seeming real.\\nHer work is in the collections of numerous of major galleries and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Washington D.C., Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, AR, the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Fl., Arkansas Art Center, Little Rock, AR,  Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, San Francisco, CA, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, CA; Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA, and the Yale University Art Gallery, Richard Brown Baker Collection, New Haven, CT.\\nShe held numerous teaching positions, including the Lamar Dodd Professorial Chair at the University of Georgia from 1997 to 2000.\\nShe was married to Leonard Post, whom she often drew.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",
              "  'Zoran Mušič (12 February 1909 – 25 May 2005), baptised as Anton Zoran Musič, was a Slovene painter, printmaker, and draughtsman. He was the only painter of Slovene descent who managed to establish himself in the elite cultural circles of Italy and France, particularly Paris in the second half of the 20th century, where he lived for most of his later life. He painted landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, as well as scenes of horror from the Dachau concentration camp and vedute of Venice.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nZoran Mušič was born in a Slovene-speaking family in Bukovica, a small village in the Vipava Valley near Gorizia, in what was then the Austrian County of Gorizia and Gradisca (now in Slovenia). Mušič\\'s father Anton was the headmaster of the local school, and his mother Marija (née Blažič) was a teacher there. Both parents were Slovenes from the Goriška region: his father was from the village of Šmartno in the Gorizia Hills – Brda Collio, and his mother was born in the hamlet of Kostanjevica in the village of Lig.\\nMušič\\'s father was mobilized and served on various battlefields during the First World War. In 1915, during the Battles of the Isonzo, the family (his mother with two children) was forced to flee to Arnače, a village near Velenje in the Duchy of Styria, where Zoran attended elementary school. In the spring of 1918, toward the end of World War I, the family moved back to Gorizia, but they were expelled again in late August 1919 by the Italian authorities, which had occupied the region. They moved to Griffen in Carinthia, but were expelled once again by the Austrian authorities after the Carinthian Plebiscite in late October 1920. They finally settled in Lower Styria, then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.\\nMušič attended two high schools in Maribor till September 1928. After, he visited Vienna for a short time. Between 1930 and 1935 he continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. Mušič spoke Slovene, German, Croatian, Italian, French and some Friulian.\\nAfter graduation in 1934, he travelled extensively around Europe. He spent three months (April to June 1935) in Spain, mainly Madrid. Later he served his obligatory army service in Bileća (November 1935 to July 1936) in Yugoslavia. Later he spent each summer in Dalmatia while being based in Maribor and nearest village Hoče. In 1940, he moved to Ljubljana permanently. During this period (1942), he painted in two churches in his native Goriška region, together with his friend, painter Avgust Černigoj (Drežnica, Grahovo) and later one in village Gradno with another Slovenian painter Lojze Spacal. In October 1943, he moved to Trieste and for some weeks for the first time to Venice. He had his first one-man show (outside Yugoslavia) in Trieste and several months later in Venice. In early October 1944, he was arrested by the Nazi German forces because he was in a group of Slovene anti-fascists. The group had hidden transmitter and was connected with British IS. His drawing and painting in Venice raised suspicions that he was a spy, and a month later he was sent to Dachau concentration camp, where he made more than 180 sketches of life in the camp, some under extremely difficult circumstances. From the drawings, mainly executed in May 1945, he managed to save around one hundred (some more with his friends). After liberation by Americans on April 29, 1945, Mušič returned to his hometown Ljubljana in early June. There, he was sent to a hospital (Golnik). A month later he was subjected to the pressures by the newly established communist regime and moved to Gorizia at the end of July 1945. In the following months he travelled in the area of Trieste and Istria, spending some time in Pinguente (Buzet). In October 1945 he settled in Venice with the help of family Cadorin and returned to the painting. In September 1949 he married the Venetian painter Ida Cadorin Barbarigo there. He also painted a room in Vila Dornacher near Zuerich at the same period.\\nIn 1950 he prepared huge tapestry: Marco Polo and his way to China for the passenger ship Augustus. At the same time he won the Gualino prize and in 1956 the Grand Prize for his printmaking at the Venice Biennale. In 1951 he was awarded the Prix de Paris, (jointly with Antonio Corpora) for his colorful paintings of Dalmatia. After 1952 he lived mainly in Paris, where the \\'lyrical abstraction\\' of the French Informel determined the art world. Throughout this period he kept his studio in Venice and exhibited again at the Biennale in 1960, when he was awarded the UNESCO Prize. The much acclaimed series We Are Not the Last, in which the artist transformed the terror of his experiences in the concentration camp into documents of universal tragedy, was made in the 1970s. His last achievement were series of Selfportratis and Double portraits. He had problems with his eyesight in his old age. Partly blind, he signed his last drawings in 2000.\\nIn 1981 Mušič was appointed Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in Paris. Mušič\\'s work has been honoured in numerous international exhibitions, such as the large retrospective exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1995, opened by the French and Slovenian presidents François Mitterrand and Milan Kučan. At the same time Austrians promised him a permanent exhibition in Klagenfurt. It was never established. A huge part of his works was taken from his studio and never returned to the painter or his wife.\\nIn 1991, a permanent collection of 134 graphic works donated by Zoran Mušič opened at Dobrovo Castle in Brda. The first installation was curated by Nelida Silič Nemec, director of the Gorizia Museum (Slovene: Goriški muzej) in Nova Gorica. A catalog was published with a list of all the donated works, an extensive biography with quotations from Zoran Mušič, and three introductory studies by Nelida Silič Nemec (The Permanent Collection of Graphic Works by Zoran Mušič), Nace Šumi (Zoran Mušič in Slovenian Painting), and Zoran Kržišnik (The Graphic Creativity of Zoran Mušič). In 1991, Mušič received the Prešeren Award for lifetime achievement, the highest recognition in the arts in Slovenia. Some of Mušič\\'s works have been featured at Piran Coastal Galleries. Gallery Zala from Ljubljana prepared seven exhibitions (four in Ljubljana, and one each in Belgrade, Vienna, and London). A large retrospective was presented at the Modern Gallery in Ljubljana in November 2009. The Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts published a volume written by 20 authors from Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Italy, and France (Vizije Zorana Mušiča) in November 2012. The only permanent exhibition of his various works (paintings, prints, and drawings) was held at the National Gallery in Ljubljana in 2016. A large temporary exhibition of selected works was prepared at Lugano\\'s Collezione Braglia in October 2016. Another exhibition took place in Venice at the Fortuny Museum in spring 2018: A Tribute to Zoran Music, The Zurich Room. The Leopold Museum in Vienna opened a large retrospective exhibition in April 2018 with 167 selected works.\\nThe first doctoral thesis related to Musich was prepared by Aurora Fonda at the University of Padua: L\\'opera giovanile di Zoran Music, Padova, 2011, which dealt with the painter\\'s early oeuvre, with a detailed inventory of his works. \\nMušič\\'s painting and Merleau-Ponty\\'s philosophy of painting were brought together in a new PhD in 2016 by Dr Nelida Nemec. She juxtaposed philosophical views on painting and the perception of the philosopher with the artistic practice and views of the painter Mušič. From Merleau-Ponty\\'s thesis that the painter and the philosopher share the same problem, the research mirrors the connection between Mušič\\'s painting and the philosopher\\'s conception of painting, and a new appreciation and broader vision and interpretation of their work. The work is a contribution to the understanding and reactualisation, to a broader vision of Mušič\\'s painting. \\nThis was followed by a French, extensive and detailed doctorate by Etienne David. It deals with the key works of the Slovenian painter and compares his oeuvre with that of Jean Fautrier.\\n\\nMušič died in Venice in 2005 at the age of 96. He is buried in the local St. Michele cemetery.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions (selection of personal presentations) ==\\n1942: Zoran Mušič.

              "  'Alessandro Raho (born 1971, Nassau, Bahamas) is a British artist. His work has been shown at the National Portrait Gallery in London.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nBorn in Nassau, Bahamas, Raho moved to London and attended Croydon College (1989–90) and then Goldsmith College, graduating in 1994 with a BA in Fine Art. In 1995, he was included in the Young British Artist showcase Brilliant! at Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.\\nIn early 1996, he was hailed as one of the great promises in British art, and had expositions noted in the American and the French press. In 2001, Raho participated in an exposition called Unseen Landscapes, in 2002, he was in the important Painting on the Move exhibition in at the Kunsthalle Basel. In 2003, exhibited his work at Cheim & Read Gallery in New York City, where his portraits received critical attention of The New York Times.\\nIn 2004, he was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery in London to paint a portrait of English actress Dame Judi Dench. Imagining Dench as a \"wealthy housewife,\" he painted her in a way that \"thrilled and flattered\" her.\\nRaho\\'s work is collected by Damien Hirst, and has been shown in Tokyo, New York, and Salzburg. Two of his pencil drawings, Catherine (2003) and Ewan (2004), are in the collection of New York\\'s Museum of Modern Art, as part of a 2005 donation by the Judith Rothschild Foundation.\\nIn 2014 Raho was nominated and short-listed for the John Moores Painting Prize. The prize was a subject of a BBC 4 documentary.\\nAlessandro Raho is represented by Alison Jacques Gallery, London.\\n\\n\\n== Style ==\\nRaho paints portraits of friends and family, seascapes and landscapes and still lives. He uses fine oil painting with a fresh contemporary approach. His paintings and photographs were described as dealing with \"narrative, nostalgia and desire,\" and he employs intricate technical processes \"to make his paintings luxuriously photographic and his photographs deceptively painterly.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              "  'Solomon \"Sol\" LeWitt (September 9, 1928 – April 8, 2007) was an American artist linked to various movements, including conceptual art and minimalism.\\nLeWitt came to fame in the late 1960s with his wall drawings and \"structures\" (a term he preferred to \"sculptures\") but was prolific in a wide range of media including drawing, printmaking, photography, painting, installation, and artist\\'s books. He has been the subject of hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world since 1965. The first biography of the artist, Sol LeWitt: A Life of Ideas, by Lary Bloom, was published by Wesleyan University Press in the spring of 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\nLeWitt was born in Hartford, Connecticut, to a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father died when he was 6. His mother took him to art classes at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.  After receiving a BFA from Syracuse University in 1949, LeWitt traveled to Europe where he was exposed to Old Master paintings. Shortly thereafter, he served in the Korean War, first in California, then Japan, and finally Korea. LeWitt moved to New York City in 1953 and set up a studio on the Lower East Side, in the old Ashkenazi Jewish settlement on Hester Street. During this time he studied at the School of Visual Arts while also pursuing his interest in design at Seventeen magazine, where he did paste-ups, mechanicals, and photostats. In 1955, he was a graphic designer in the office of architect I.M. Pei for a year. Around that time, LeWitt also discovered the work of the late 19th-century photographer Eadweard Muybridge, whose studies in sequence and locomotion were an early influence for him. These experiences, combined with an entry-level job as a night receptionist and clerk he took in 1960 at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, would influence LeWitt\\'s later work.\\nAt MoMA, LeWitt\\'s co-workers included fellow artists Robert Ryman, Dan Flavin, Gene Beery, and Robert Mangold, and the future art critic and writer, Lucy Lippard who worked as a page in the library. Curator Dorothy Canning Miller\\'s now famous 1960 \"Sixteen Americans\" exhibition with work by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Frank Stella created a swell of excitement and discussion among the community of artists with whom LeWitt associated. LeWitt also became friends with Hanne Darboven, Eva Hesse, and Robert Smithson.\\nLeWitt taught at several New York schools, including New York University and the School of Visual Arts, during the late 1960s. In 1980, LeWitt left New York for Spoleto, Italy. After returning to the United States in the late 1980s, LeWitt made Chester, Connecticut, his primary residence. He died at age 78 in New York from cancer complications.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nLeWitt is regarded as a founder of both Minimal and Conceptual art. His prolific two and three-dimensional work ranges from wall drawings (over 1200 of which have been executed) to hundreds of works on paper extending to structures in the form of towers, pyramids, geometric forms, and progressions. These works range in size from books and gallery-sized installations to monumental outdoor pieces. LeWitt\\'s first serial sculptures were created in the 1960s using the modular form of the square in arrangements of varying visual complexity. In Issue 5 of 0 To 9 magazine, LeWitt\\'s work \\'Sentences on Conceptual Art\\' was published.This piece became one of the most widely cited artists\\' writings of the 1960s, exploring the relationship between art, practice and art criticism. In 1979, LeWitt participated in the design for the Lucinda Childs Dance Company\\'s piece Dance.\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\nIn the early 1960s, LeWitt first began to create his \"structures,\" a term he used to describe his three-dimensional work. His frequent use of open, modular structures originates from the cube, a form that influenced the artist\\'s thinking from the time that he first became an artist. After creating an early body of work made up of closed-form wooden objects, heavily lacquered by hand, in the mid-1960s he \"decided to remove the skin altogether and reveal the structure.\"  This skeletal form, the radically simplified open cube, became a basic building block of the artist\\'s three-dimensional work. In the mid-1960s, LeWitt began to work with the open cube: twelve identical linear elements connected at eight corners to form a skeletal structure. From 1969, he would conceive many of his modular structures on a large scale, to be constructed in aluminum or steel by industrial fabricators. Several of LeWitt\\'s cube structures stood at approximate eye level. The artist introduced bodily proportion to his fundamental sculptural unit at this scale.\\nFollowing early experimentation LeWitt settled on a standard version for his modular cubes, circa 1965: the negative space between the beams would stand to the positive space of the sculptural material itself in a ratio of 8.5:1, or \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            17\\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {17}{2}}}\\n  \\n.  The material would also be painted white instead of black, to avoid the \"expressiveness\" of the black color of earlier, similar pieces.  Both the ratio and the color were arbitrary aesthetic choices, but once taken they were used consistently in several pieces which typify LeWitt\\'s \"modular cube\" works.  Museums holding specimens of LeWitt\\'s modular cube works have published lesson suggestions for elementary education, meant to encourage children to investigate the mathematical properties of the artworks.\\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, LeWitt composed some of his sculptures from stacked cinder blocks, still generating variations within self-imposed restrictions. At this time, he began to work with concrete blocks. In 1985, the first cement Cube was built in a park in Basel. From 1990 onwards, LeWitt conceived multiple variations on a tower to be constructed using concrete blocks. In a shift away from his well-known geometric vocabulary of forms, the works LeWitt realized in the late 1990s indicate vividly the artist\\'s growing interest in somewhat random curvilinear shapes and highly saturated colors.\\nIn 2007, LeWitt conceived 9 Towers, a cube made from more than 1,000 light-coloured bricks that measure five meters on each side. It was installed at the Kivik Art Centre in Lilla Stenshuvud, Sweden, in 2014.\\n\\n\\n=== Wall drawings ===\\nIn 1968, LeWitt began to conceive sets of guidelines or simple diagrams for his two-dimensional works drawn directly on the wall, executed first in graphite, then in crayon, later in colored pencil and finally in chromatically rich washes of India ink, bright acrylic paint, and other materials. Since he created a work of art for Paula Cooper Gallery\\'s inaugural show in 1968, an exhibition to benefit the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, thousands of LeWitt\\'s drawings have been installed directly on the surfaces of walls. Between 1969 and 1970 he created four \"Drawings Series\", which presented different combinations of the basic element that governed many of his early wall drawings. In each series he applied a different system of change to each of twenty-four possible combinations of a square divided into four equal parts, each containing one of the four basic types of lines LeWitt used (vertical, horizontal, diagonal left, and diagonal right). The result is four possible permutations for each of the twenty-four original units. The system used in Drawings Series I is what LeWitt termed \\'Rotation,\\' Drawings Series II uses a system termed \\'Mirror,\\' Drawings Series III uses \\'Cross & Reverse Mirror,\\' and Drawings Series IV uses \\'Cross Reverse\\'.\\n\\nIn Wall Drawing #122, first installed in 1972 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the work contains \"all combinations of two lines crossing, placed at random, using arcs from corners and sides, straight, not straight and broken lines\" resulting in 150 unique pairings that unfold on the gallery walls. LeWitt further expanded on this theme, creating variations such as Wall Drawing #260 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which systematically runs through all possible two-part combinations of arcs and lines. Conceived in 1995, Wall Drawing #792: Black rectangles and squares underscores LeWitt\\'s early interest in the intersections between art and architecture. Spanning the two floors of the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Brussels, this work consists of varying combinations of black rectangles, creating an irregular grid-like pattern.\\nLeWitt, who had moved to Spoleto, Italy, in the late 1970s credited his transition from graphite pencil or crayon to vivid ink washes, to his encounter with the frescoes of Giotto, Masaccio, and other early Florentine painters. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he created highly saturated colorful acrylic wall drawings. While their forms are curvilinear, playful and seem almost random, they are also drawn according to an exacting set of guidelines. The bands are a standard width, for example, and no colored section may touch another section of the same color.\\nIn 2005 LeWitt began a series of \\'scribble\\' wall drawings, so termed because they required the draftsmen to fill in areas of the wall by scribbling with graphite. The scribbling occurs at six different densities, which are indicated on the artist\\'s diagrams and then mapped out in string on the surface of the wall. The gradations of scribble density produce a continuum of tone that implies three dimensions. The largest scribble wall drawing, Wall Drawing #1268, is on view at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery.\\nAccording to the principle of his work, LeWitt\\'s wall drawings are usually executed by people other than the artist himself. Even after his death, people are still making these drawings. He would therefore eventually use teams of assistants to create such works. Writing about making wall drawings, LeWitt himself observed in 1971 that \"each person draws a line differently and each person understands words differently\". Between 1968 and his death in 2007, LeWitt created more than 1,270 wall drawings. The wall drawings, executed on-site, generally exist for the duration of an exhibition; they are then destroyed, giving the work in its physical form an ephemeral quality. They can be installed, removed, and then reinstalled in another location, as many times as required for exhibition purposes. When transferred to another location, the number of walls can change only by ensuring that the proportions of the original diagram are retained.\\nPermanent murals by LeWitt can be found at, among others, the AXA Center, New York (1984–85); The Swiss Re headquarters Americas in Armonk, New York, the Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta (Wall Drawing #581, 1989/90); the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC (Wall Drawing #1103, 2003); the Conrad Hotel, New York (Loopy Doopy (Blue and Purple), 1999); the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo (Wall Drawing #1268: Scribbles: Staircase (AKAG), 2006/2010); Akron Art Museum, Akron (2007); the Columbus Circle Subway Station, New York; The Jewish Museum (New York), New York; the Green Center for Physics at MIT, Cambridge (Bars of Colors Within Squares (MIT), 2007); the Embassy of the United States in Berlin; the Wadsworth Atheneum; and John Pearson\\'s House, Oberlin, Ohio. The artist\\'s last public wall drawing, Wall Drawing #1259: Loopy Doopy (Springfield) (2008), is at the United States Courthouse in Springfield, Massachusetts (designed by architect Moshe Safdie). Wall Drawing #599: Circles 18 (1989) — a bull\\'s eye of concentric circles in alternating bands of yellow, blue, red and white — was installed at the lobby of the Jewish Community Center, New York, in 2013.\\n\\n\\n=== Gouaches ===\\nIn the 1980s, in particular after a trip to Italy, LeWitt started using gouache, an opaque water-based paint, to produce free-flowing abstract works in contrasting colors. These represented a significant departure from the rest of his practice, as he created these works with his own hands. LeWitt\\'s gouaches are often created in series based on a specific motif. Past series have included Irregular Forms, Parallel Curves, Squiggly Brushstrokes and Web-like Grids.\\nAlthough this loosely rendered composition may have been a departure from his earlier, more geometrically structured works visually, it nevertheless remained in alignment with his original artistic intent. LeWitt painstakingly made his own prints from his gouache compositions. In 2012, art advisor Heidi Lee Komaromi curated, \"Sol LeWitt: Works on Paper 1983-2003\", an exhibition revealing the variety of techniques LeWitt employed on paper during the final decades of his life.\\n\\n\\n=== Artist\\'s books ===\\nFrom 1966, LeWitt\\'s interest in seriality led to his production of more than 50 artist\\'s books throughout his career; he later donated many examples to the Wadsworth Athenaeum\\'s library. In 1976 LeWitt helped found Printed Matter, Inc, a for-profit art space in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City with fellow artists and critics Lucy Lippard, Carol Androcchio, Amy Baker (Sandback), Edit DeAk, Mike Glier, Nancy Linn, Walter Robinson, Ingrid Sischy, Pat Steir, Mimi Wheeler, Robin White and Irena von Zahn. LeWitt was a signal innovator of the genre of the \"artist\\'s book,\" a term that was coined for a 1973 exhibition curated by Dianne Perry Vanderlip at Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia.\\nPrinted Matter was one of the first organizations dedicated to creating and distributing artists\\' books, incorporating self-publishing, small-press publishing, and artist networks and collectives. For LeWitt and others, Printed Matter also served as a support system for avant-garde artists, balancing its role as publisher, exhibition space, retail space, and community center for the downtown arts scene, in that sense emulating the network of aspiring artists LeWitt knew and enjoyed as a staff member at the Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture and landscaping ===\\nLeWitt collaborated with architect Stephen Lloyd to design a synagogue for his congregation Beth Shalom Rodfe Zedek; he conceptualized the \"airy\" synagogue building, with its shallow dome supported by \"exuberant wooden roof beams\", an homage to the wooden synagogues of eastern Europe.\\nIn 1981, LeWitt was invited by the Fairmount Park Art Association (currently known as the Association for Public Art) to propose a public artwork for a site in Fairmount Park. He selected the long, rectangular plot of land known as the Reilly Memorial and submitted a drawing with instructions. Installed in 2011, Lines in Four Directions in Flowers is made up of more than 7,000 plantings arranged in strategically configured rows. In his original proposal, the artist planned an installation of flower plantings of four different colors (white, yellow, red & blue) in four equal rectangular areas, in rows of four directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal right & left) framed by evergreen hedges of about 2\\' height, with each color block comprising four to five species that bloom sequentially.\\n\\nIn 2004, Six Curved Walls sculpture was installed on the hillside slope of Crouse College on Syracuse University campus. The concrete block sculpture consists of six undulating walls, each 12 feet high, and spans 140 feet. The sculpture was designed and constructed to mark the inauguration of Nancy Cantor as the 11th Chancellor of Syracuse University.\\n\\n\\n== Collection ==\\nSince the early 1960s he and his wife, Carol Androccio, gathered nearly 9,000 works of art through purchases, in trades with other artists and dealers, or as gifts. In this way he acquired works by approximately 750 artists, including Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman, Hanne Darboven, Eva Hesse, Donald Judd, On Kawara, Kazuko Miyamoto, Carl Andre, Dan Graham, Hans Haacke, Gerhard Richter, and others. In 2007, the exhibition \"Selections from The LeWitt Collection\" at the Weatherspoon Art Museum assembled approximately 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, and photographs, among them works by Andre, Alice Aycock, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jan Dibbets, Jackie Ferrara, Gilbert and George, Alex Katz, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, Mario Merz, Shirin Neshat, Pat Steir, and many other artists.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nLeWitt\\'s work was first publicly exhibited in 1964 in a group show curated by Dan Flavin at the Kaymar Gallery, New York.Dan Graham\\'s John Daniels Gallery later gave him his first solo show in 1965. In 1966, he participated in the \"Primary Structures\" exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York (a seminal show which helped define the minimalist movement), submitting an untitled, open modular cube of 9 units. The same year he was included in the \"10\" exhibit at Dwan Gallery, New York. He was later invited by Harald Szeemann to participate in \"When Attitude Becomes Form,\" at the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland, in 1969. Interviewed in 1993 about those years LeWitt remarked, \"I decided I would make color or form recede and proceed in a three-dimensional way.\"\\nThe Gemeentemuseum in The Hague presented his first retrospective exhibition in 1970, and his work was later shown in a major mid-career retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1978. In 1972/1973, LeWitt\\'s first museum shows in Europe were mounted at the Kunsthalle Bern and the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. In 1975, Lewitt created \"The Location of a Rectangle for the Hartford Atheneum\" for the third MATRIX exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. Later that year, he participated in the Wadsworth Atheneum\\'s sixth MATRIX exhibition, providing instructions for a second wall drawing. MoMA gave LeWitt his first retrospective in 1978-79. The exhibition traveled to various American venues. For the 1987 Skulptur Projekte Münster, Germany, he realized Black Form: Memorial to the Missing Jews, a rectangular wall of black concrete blocks for the center of a plaza in front of an elegant, white Neoclassical government building; it is now installed at Altona Town Hall, Hamburg. Other major exhibitions since include Sol LeWitt Drawings 1958-1992, which was organized by the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Netherlands in 1992 which traveled over the next three years to museums in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the United States; and in 1996, the Museum of Modern Art, New York mounted a traveling survey exhibition: \"Sol LeWitt Prints: 1970-1995\". A major LeWitt retrospective was organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2000. The exhibition traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\\nIn 2006, LeWitt\\'s Drawing Series… was displayed at Dia:Beacon and was devoted to the 1970s drawings by the conceptual artist. Drafters and assistants drew directly on the walls using graphite, colored pencil, crayon, and chalk. The works were based on LeWitt\\'s complex principles, which eliminated the limitations of the canvas for more extensive constructions.\\n\\n\"Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective\", a collaboration between the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG), MASS MoCA (Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art), and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA) opened to the public in 2008 at MASS MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts. The exhibition will be on view for 25 years and is housed in a three-story 27,000-square-foot (2,500 m2) historic mill building in the heart of MASS MoCA\\'s campus fully restored by Bruner/Cott and Associates architects (and outfitted with a sequence of new interior walls constructed to LeWitt\\'s specifications.) The exhibition consists of 105 drawings — comprising nearly one acre of wall surface — that LeWitt created over 40 years from 1968 to 2007 and includes several drawings never before seen, some of which LeWitt created for the project shortly before his death.\\nFurthermore, the artist was the subject of exhibitions at P.S. 1 Contemporary Center, Long Island City (Concrete Blocks); the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover (Twenty-Five Years of Wall Drawings, 1968-1993); and Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford (Incomplete Cubes), which traveled to three art museums in the United States. At the time of his death, LeWitt had just organized a retrospective of his work at the Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio.\\nAt Naples Sol LeWitt. L\\'artista e i suoi artisti opened at the Museo Madre on December 15, 2012, running until April 1, 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Museum collections ==\\nLeWitt\\'s works are found in the most important museum collections including: Tate Modern, London, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, National Museum of Serbia in Belgrade, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, Hallen für Neue Kunst Schaffhausen, Switzerland, Australian National Gallery, Canberra, Australia, Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Dia:Beacon, The Jewish Museum in Manhattan, Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida, MASS MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts Institute of Technology List Art Center\\'s Public Art Collection, Cambridge, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. The erection of Double Negative Pyramid by Sol LeWitt at Europos Parkas in Vilnius, Lithuania was a significant event in the history of art in post Berlin Wall era.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\n\\nSol LeWitt was one of the main figures of his time; he transformed the process of art-making by questioning the fundamental relationship between an idea, the subjectivity of the artist, and the artwork a given idea might produce. While many artists were challenging modern conceptions of originality, authorship, and artistic genius in the 1960s, LeWitt denied that approaches such as Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Process Art were merely technical or illustrative of philosophy. In his Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, LeWitt asserted that Conceptual art was neither mathematical nor intellectual but intuitive, given that the complexity inherent to transforming an idea into a work of art was fraught with contingencies. LeWitt\\'s art is not about the singular hand of the artist; it is the idea behind each work that surpasses the work itself. In the early 21st century, LeWitt\\'s work, especially the wall drawings, has been critically acclaimed for its economic perspicacity. Though modest—most exist as simple instructions on a sheet of paper—the drawings can be made again and again and again, anywhere in the world, without the artist needing to be involved in their production.\\n\\n\\n== Art world ==\\nHis auction record of $749,000 was set in 2014 for his gouache on paperboard piece Wavy Brushstroke (1995) at Sotheby\\'s, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Selected books ==\\nBloom, Lary.

              "  'Odinigwe Benedict Chukwukadibia Enwonwu   MBE (14 July 1917 – 5 February 1994), better known as Ben Enwonwu, was a Nigerian painter and sculptor. Arguably the most influential African artist of the 20th century, his pioneering career opened the way for the postcolonial proliferation and increased visibility of modern African art. He was one of the first African artists to win critical acclaim, having exhibited in august exhibition spaces in Europe and the United States and listed in international directories of contemporary art. Since 1950, Enwonwu was celebrated as \"Africa\\'s Greatest Artist\" by the international media and his fame was used to enlist support for Black Nationalists movement all over the world. The Enwonwu crater on the planet Mercury is named in his honour.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nBen Enwonwu was born a twin on 14 July 1917 into the noble family of Umueze-Aroli in Onitsha, Anambra State, southeastern region of Nigeria. His father, Omenka Odigwe Emeka Enwonwu, was a technician who worked with the Royal Niger Company. He was also a member of the Onitsha Council of Chiefs and a traditional sculptor of repute, who created staffs of office, stools, decorative doors and religious images. His mother, Chinyelugo Iyom Nweze, was a successful cloth merchant.\\nUpon his father\\'s death in 1921, Enwonwu inherited his tools, going on to perfect the art of carving in the style of indigenous Igbo sculpture, begun earlier with his father, who first nurtured his precocious talent.\\n\\n\\n=== Education ===\\nBetween 1921 and 1931, Enwonwu attended five primary schools: St. Joseph\\'s Elementary School, Onitsha (1926–28); St, Theresa\\'s Elementary School, Umuahia (1928–29); St. Mary\\'s Primary School, Port Harcourt (1929–30); Holy Trinity Primary; and St. Mary\\'s Primary School, both in Onitsha (1930–31). In 1933, Enwonwu attended St. Patrick\\'s School, Ibusa, and later enrolled at the Government College, Ibadan, completing his secondary education at Government College Umuahia in 1937. At both colleges, he studied fine art under Kenneth C. Murray. Murray was an education officer in charge of art education in the colonial civil service and later director of antiquities. During their time together, Enwonwu became Murray\\'s assistant and was recognised as one of the most gifted and technically proficient students of the \"Murray Group\" (Ben C. Enwonwu, C. C. Ibeto, D.L. Nnachy, M. Teze and A. P. Umana). The period of study under Murray marked the beginning of Enwonwu\\'s formal education in art.\\nIn 1944, under a joint Shell Petroleum Company and British Council scholarship, he attended the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London, and in 1945, the Ruskin School, Ashmolean, Oxford University, where the Slade had been relocated during World War II. In 1947, he received a first-class diploma in fine art from the Slade and registered for postgraduate work in anthropology (with a focus on West African ethnography) at the University of London. In 1948, Enwonwu completed his studies.\\nNkiru Nzegwu states that the racist atmosphere he encountered during his stay in England sparked his interest in entering this programme. Anthropology offered a space for the scientific study of the races, their physical and mental characteristics, customs, and social relationships. In 1937, Murray exhibited Enwonwu\\'s work at the Zwemmer Gallery in London In 1969, he received an honorary doctorate degree from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, north-western region of Nigeria.\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\n\\nAfter working with Murray for many years, Enwonwu was hired as a teacher at the Government College of Umuahia. According to Sylvester Ogbechie, author of Ben Enwonwu: The Making of an African Modernist, Murray was displeased with the university\\'s choice to provide Enwonwu with the same salary as the other seasoned teachers. This created a rift between both men. Eventually Murray left Government College and Enwonwu replaced him as art teacher. He continued his work as an art teacher in other various schools, including mission school in Calabar Province (1940–41), and Edo College, Benin City (1941–43). He was art adviser to the Nigerian government from 1948.\\nDuring the years following 1950, he toured and lectured in the United States, and executed many commissions as a freelance artist. In 1951, he met with the founding members of the Lagos auxiliary to the Anti Slavery and Aborigines Right Society, which was at that time headed by Candido Da Rocha, and had James Johnson, Samuel Pearse, and Sapara Williams as members. and became their official art illustrator. From 1949 to 1954, Enwonwu held many art exhibitions within London, Lagos, Milan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Boston. In the course of her 1956 visit to Nigeria, Queen Elizabeth II commissioned and sat for a portrait sculpture by Enwonwu. At the Royal Society of British Artists exhibition in London of 1957, he unveiled the bronze sculpture.\\nIn 1959, Enwonwu was appointed Supervisor in the Information Service Department office in Nigeria. He was a fellow of Lagos University (1966–68), cultural advisor to the Nigeria government (1968–71), and visiting artist at the Institute of African Studies at Howard University, Washington, DC, in 1971. He was appointed the first professor of Fine Arts at the University of Ife, Ile-Ife, from 1971 to 1975. He was also art consultant to the International Secretariat, Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC) in Lagos of 1977. The President of Nigeria, Shehu Shagari, presented a small sculpture of Enwonwu\\'s Anywanu, a representation of the Igbo earth goddess Ani, to Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on the occasion of his state visit to the United Kingdom in 1981.\\nEnwonwu executed portraits of Nigerians as private commissions and illustrated Amos Tutuola\\'s 1958 novel The Brave African Huntress. He maintained a studio in London and was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute, London.\\n\\n\\n== Impact on the modern art world ==\\nOgbechie describes his art as \"[the opening up of] third space in art history whose nature and parameters are at variance with art history\\'s exclusionary narratives of modernity and its inscription of the modern artist-subject as a white, Western European male\". Recognition of his bronze sculpture of the Queen proved that he, as an African modern artist, used his practice to develop a new kind of modern art whose ideals of representation and notions of artistic identity were different from conventional art-historical narrative of European modernist practice.\\nTutu, a series of three portraits of the Ife princess Adetutu Ademiluyi (\\'Tutu\\'), were painted by Enwonwu in 1973 and have been missing since 1975. One of the three paintings was rediscovered in 2017 in a London flat. It was sold for £1,205,000 in an auction held by Bonhams. The portrait of Tutu, one of the three made by the painter, is a Nigerian national icon and considered a reconciliation symbol between the government and Biafran separatists after the civil war.\\nA painting by Enwonwu, titled \"Owo Market\" and showing a marketplace scene in the Nigerian city of Owo, and dated 1949, was restored on the BBC programme The Repair Shop, broadcast on 7 August 2019. The painting\\'s owner had known Enwonwu, and described him as a lovely man always with a flower in his lapel and some of his work can be found in the Kakofoni Group Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works ==\\n\\n\\tFrom the National Archives and Records Administration\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nPortrait of Chief Candido Joao Da Rocha (1951) which was exhibited during FESTAC LAGOS 1977\\nAnyanwu (1954–55): Commissioned for the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos, still in situ.

              "  'Eugene James Martin (July 24, 1938 – January 1, 2005)\\nwas an African-American visual artist.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nEugene J. Martin\\'s art is best known for his imaginative, complex mixed media collages on paper, his often gently humorous pencil and pen and ink drawings, and his paintings on paper and canvas that may incorporate whimsical allusions to animal, machine and structural imagery among areas of \"pure\", constructed, biomorphic, or disciplined lyrical abstraction. Martin called many of his works straddling both abstraction and representation \"satirical abstracts\". He did not create sculptures.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\nEugene James Martin was born on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. His parents were Margaret Helen Dove and James Walter Martin, an itinerant Jazz musician. After his mother died in 1942 giving birth to Jerry Martin, the two brothers were placed in foster care in Washington, D.C. As a child, Eugene ran away on several occasions, was placed in reform school at six years of age, and eventually spent the remainder of his childhood on a farm in Clarksburg, Maryland, where his foster parents were Franie and Madessa Snowdon. On the farm he drew realistic portraits and nature scenes, and also played upright bass, thunder bass, and slide trombone in the local rhythm & blues band The Nu-tones. After attending Clarksburg Elementary, and Lincoln High and Carver High in Rockville, Maryland, Martin pondered whether to become a full-time musician or visual artist. He briefly attended the Navy for the opportunity to receive an art education, but instead was honorably discharged.\\nAfter attending the Corcoran School of Art from 1960–1963, Eugene James Martin became a professional fine arts painter, considering artistic integrity his only guide. He did not adhere to only a single art movement, remaining an individualist throughout his life. His art defies categorization.\\nWhile spending most of his life in Washington, D.C., Martin briefly lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, from 1990–1994, returned to Washington, D.C., and in 1996 moved to Lafayette, Louisiana, with his wife, Suzanne Fredericq, a biologist, whom he married in 1988. In December 2001 he suffered simultaneously a brain hemorrhage and stroke while in Belgium. After undergoing physical therapy in Lafayette, Louisiana, he resumed painting and continued creating art until his death there.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\n\\nEugene Martin\\'s works of art can be found in numerous private art collections throughout the world, and are included in the permanent collection of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, New Orleans; the Alexandria Museum of Art, Louisiana; the Stowitts Museum & Library in Pacific Grove, California;  the Munich Museum of Modern Art; the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York; the Mobile Museum of Art, Alabama; the Walter O.

              "  'Jim Hodges (born October 16, 1957) is a New York-based installation artist. He is known for his mixed-media sculptures and collages that involve delicate artificial flowers, mirrors, chains as spiderwebs, and cut-up jeans.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nJim Hodges was born in Spokane, Washington and received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Fort Wright College in 1980. He received his Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, in 1986. \\nThat year he met art collector Elaine Dannheisser who let him use a studio in the basement of her foundation on Duane Street in exchange for working as a part-time art handler. During this time he abandoned his original medium of painting and started exploring materiality; this became his first major artistic crisis because he had realized that his concepts weren\\'t connecting with his paintings.\\nAfter living in Dannheisser\\'s basement for approximately four years, his creativity suffered. Only dedicating three days a week to making art, he eventually became poor, unstable, and lived in his studio illegally until Dannheisser kicked him out. However, after he became sober, his career picked up with a piece called Flesh Suspense (1989–1990).\\n\\n\\n== Style and works ==\\nSince the late 1980s, Hodges created a broad range of work exploring themes of fragility, temporality, love, and death.  His works frequently employed different materials and techniques, from ready-made objects to more traditional media, such as metal chains, artificial flowers, gold leaf, and mirrored elements. Hodges\\' conceptual practice, which addressed overlooked and obvious touchstones of life, reflected human experience and mortality.\\nHodges challenged the acceptance of traditionally feminine materials and craft by expanding the possibilities of these materials in his own works. As seen in \"With the Wind\" (1997) and \"You\" (1997), he consistently incorporated embroidery to magnify notions of domesticity, a mother\\'s presence, and early notions of femininity.\\nOriginally influenced by the woods of his hometown of Spokane, nature plays a reoccurring role throughout his works. In the years following his graduation from Pratt Institute, Hodges struggled to develop a theme within his works that would express his role as an artist. His use of color disappeared during this period, when he abandoned painting and gradually developed a process of creation through destruction. Color was reincorporated when he began using fabric flowers. Hodges did not intend this as an appropriation of nature but its antithesis: fake flowers. Abstractions of nature permeate Hodges\\' oeuvre and are further demonstrated through his interest in camouflage as a way to represent the landscape through an abstract medium. This is evident in his 2016 mirror-and-glass work I dreamed a world and called it love, an immersive installation at Gladstone Gallery which was meant to call to mind an abstraction of Claude Monet\\'s room-encompassing paintings at the Musée de l\\'Orangerie, Paris.\\nDuring the late 1990s, artists responded to the AIDS epidemic with forms of expression ranging from the written word to abstract artistic statements reflected in anger or elegy. This movement led to iconic artwork influenced by advocacy group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). Hodges\\' work emerged through the direct influence of his personal experience, and through his notions of love and acceptance towards the self and those in other circumstances.\\n\\n\\n=== A Little Extra Something ===\\nIn A Little Extra Something (1990–1991) Hodges covered the surface of a sheet of paper with theatrical make-up, where the paper resembled skin and the makeup showed delight in its application. This piece, according to Hodges, alluded to his own homosexuality.\\n\\n\\n=== Saliva-transfer drawings ===\\nIn 1992 Hodges incorporated himself into the material of his pieces through the use of his saliva. He drew ink doodles of spider webs, clovers, chains, lines, spirals, and a matrix of dots, then blurred them with his saliva by pressing the wet images against another paper and created different printed impressions. Hodges said that by using his saliva with his materials, it revealed a \"sensuous act\", where his hand would draw the images and his mouth would transmit it. This expressed Hodges\\' empowerment, and was intended to disrupt the preconception of bodily fluids as something horrifying.\\n\\n\\n=== Don\\'t Be Afraid ===\\nIn 2004 Hodges was invited by Susan Stoops, a curator at the Worcester Art Museum, to create a mural on the museum rotunda. During this time, the U.S. government was raising concerns of public safety with a series of alerts. Responding to this and the destruction of the World Trade Center, Hodges offered the message \"don\\'t be afraid\" for comfort and support to the citizens of America. He wrote a letter of invitation to all the UN delegates, incorporating their handwritten versions of this phrase to create a global chorus that conveyed a message of inclusion, strength, and optimism. Hodges had received more than one hundred translations in over seventy languages; the only country which refused to participate was the United States.\\n\\n\\n=== Untitled (2010) ===\\nIn 2010, Hodges was invited to speak about his friend and colleague Felix Gonzalez-Torres at Artpace in San Antonio, Texas. Instead of a lecture, Hodges collaborated with Carlos Marques da Cruz and Encke King in a 60-minute film called Untitled (2010). The film quilted fragments from various social media outlets such as the 1980s AIDS/HIV activism of ACT UP, TV shows such as The Golden Girls, Dynasty, and The Wizard of Oz, and images of the burning oil fields of Iraq and the death camps of World War II. Hodges described this work as a fragment of a continuum which could be added or reworked endlessly. Hodges attempted to mirror the content that shaped the life of Gonzalez-Torres before he lost his battle with AIDS in 1996.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and permanent installations ==\\nHodges had been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions in the United States and Europe and his work had been included in various group exhibitions, including the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Hodges is currently a senior critic in the Sculpture Department at the Yale University School of Art.\\nJim Hodges: Give More Than You Take was a mid-career retrospective of Hodges\\' work organized by the Walker Art Center and the Dallas Museum of Art. This exhibition opened at the Dallas Museum on October 6, 2013, and visited the Walker in Minneapolis, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, closing on January 17, 2015. The retrospective was accompanied by a large-format appraisal of Hodges\\' work, edited by Jeffrey Grove and Olga Viso.\\nHodges\\' piece Don\\'t Be Afraid was installed at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. in 2005. A recent large-scale sculpture, look and see (a nine-ton stainless steel abstraction of camouflage) was purchased by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York on October 30, 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\\n2022: \"Impossible Flower,\" Baldwin Gallery, Aspen\\n2022: \"Location Proximity,\" Gladstone Gallery, New York\\n2020: \"LOVE POWER,\" Massimo De Carlo, Hong Kong, PRC\\n2019: \"Unearthed,\" Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, California\\n2019: \"Jim Hodges,\" Pizzuti Collection of CMA, Columbus Museum of Art, Columbus, Ohio\\n2018: \"Jim Hodges: silence stillness,\" Anthony Meier Fine Arts, San Francisco, California\\n2017: \"turning pages in the book of love / voltando pagine nel libro dell’amore\", Massimo de Carlo Gallery, Milan, Italy\\n2017: \"Tracing the contour of our days,\" Baldwin Gallery, Aspen, Colorado\\n2016: \"With Liberty and Justice for All,\" rooftop installation, The Contemporary Austin, Texas\\n2016: \"I dreamed a world and called it Love.,\" Gladstone Gallery, New York\\n2016: \"Jim Hodges,\" Stephen Friedman Gallery, London, United Kingdom\\n2015: \"Jim Hodges,\" Gladstone Gallery, Brussels\\n2014: \"Jim Hodges: Give More Than You Take,\" Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, California [traveled from: Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas (2013);

              "  'Jesse Beau Richards (born July 17, 1975) is a painter, filmmaker and photographer from New Haven, Connecticut and was affiliated with the international movement Stuckism. He has been described as \"one of the most provocative names in American underground culture,\" and \"the father of remodernist cinema.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJesse Richards was born in New Haven. He had an ambition to be a forest ranger during his teens, which was also the time he started to make films. He studied film production at the School of Visual Arts, New York City, which he left after a nervous breakdown. He directed plays including Hamlet and Look Back In Anger for the New Haven Theatre Company, and made short romance and punk films.\\nIn 1999, Richards was arrested for reckless burning, destruction of property and disorderly conduct. After the charges were dropped, he began painting.\\n\\n\\n== Stuckism ==\\nRichards is affiliated with the Stuckist art movement in 2001 and founded a gallery as the first Stuckism center in the United States in 2002, helping to organize shows. The center opened its doors with a show entitled \"We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings.\"\\nIn 2003, an anti-war \"Clown Trial of President Bush\" took place outside the New Haven Federal Courthouse, in order to \"highlight the fact that the Iraq War does not have the support of the United Nations, thus violating a binding contract with the UN\". It was staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by Richards with Nicholas Watson and Tony Juliano. One of the participants was a public defender for the state of Connecticut.\\nSimultaneously the Stuckism center opened a War on Bush show, including work from Brazil, Australia, Germany and the UK, while the London equivalent staged a War on Blair show. Richards said the original intention of a straightforward art show to an anti-war show had been changed after a phone discussion with Stuckism founder, Charles Thomson. Richards told The Yale Herald, \"Duchamp would go over to the Yale University Art Gallery and he would say, \\'This is crap,\\' and he would go paint a picture.\"\\n\\nAlso in 2003, Richards was an exhibitor in the UK show, Stuck in Wednesbury at Wednesbury Museum & Art Gallery, the first Stuckist show in a public gallery, and in The Stuckists Summer Show at the Stuckism International Gallery, London.\\nIn 2004, Richards was one of eight artists in the \"International Stuckists\" section of The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery during the Liverpool Biennial. He said of his exhibited work, Nightlife: \"This came out of heavy drinking and loneliness. New Haven\\'s social scene is entirely going to bars, so it was my only way to meet new people.\"\\n\\nRichards reviewed the Biennial and the Stuckist show, where he found Joe Machine\\'s My Grandfather Will Fight You, \"one of the best Stuckist paintings. Machine\\'s work is the epitome of raw, real expressive painting.\" He said that Stuckist Photographer Andy Bullock\\'s work was \"silly installation photography\" which was \"trying to be trendy.\"\\nIn 2005, 160 paintings from the Walker Art Gallery show, including one by Richards, were offered as a donation to the Tate gallery, but rejected by Sir Nicholas Serota, because \"We do not feel that the work is of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection\".\\nIn 2005, Richards was a co-ordinator of, and participated in, Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism, the first Remodernism exhibition in the US to include work from all of the Remodernist groups, including the Stuckists, the Defastenists, Remodernist Film and Photography, and Stuckism Photography. The show took place at the CBGB 313 gallery.\\nIn 2006, Richards was one of the artists in The Triumph of Stuckism, a show at Liverpool John Moores University Hope Street Gallery, curated by Naive John at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Research at Liverpool School of Art and Design, and part of the Liverpool Biennial 2006.\\nRichards left the Stuckist movement in 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Shows ==\\n\\nStuckist group shows organized or featuring work by Richards include:\\n\\n2002 We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings – New Haven\\n2003 War on Bush – New Haven\\n2003 Stuck in Wednesbury – Wednesbury\\n2003 The Stuckists Summer Show – London\\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian – Liverpool Biennial\\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian In the Toilet – New Haven\\n2005 Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism – New York City\\n2006 The Triumph of Stuckism – Liverpool Biennial\\n\\n\\n== Film and photography ==\\nRichards has worked on films with Nicholas Watson since 1996. Their film noir, Blackout, was premiered at the event Stuck Films at the New Haven Stuckism International Center in 2002.\\nIn 2003, Richards co-produced Shooting at the Moon, a short film premiering at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. In 2008, the film made its London premiere at Horse Hospital during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Richards said that his films had previously often contained nudity, but this time he wanted to do the opposite and the two leads do not quite even kiss:\\n\\nWhile making this film I guess the main thing we were thinking about accomplishing was to express this emotional experience, and have people really feel it, and not to get too complicated with story or anything that would distract from this feeling we wanted people to have while watching the film.\\nA book of pinhole photography called \"Dark Chamber\", featuring new work by Richards as well as work by Wolf Howard, Billy Childish and others was published by Urban Fox Press in May 2007.\\nBrian Sherwin said of Richards that his work was \"Street truth\":\\n\\nHis work may seem crude to some, but at least it is honest (sometimes brutally honest.) This honesty is captured by his ability to convey human behavior and struggles with each shot from his camera.\\nIn February 2010, the Australian film magazine Filmink announced Richards\\' participation in a compilation feature film by the Remodernist film movement. The film is scheduled to premiere in New York in December 2010.\\nIn December 2010, Richards joined the Board of Directors of Cine Foundation International.\\nRichards currently lives in Granby, Massachusetts.\\n\\n\\n=== Remodernist film movement ===\\n\\nIn 2004, Richards and fellow filmmaker Harris Smith co-founded Remodernist Film and Photography, a new Remodernist group attempting to introduce Remodernist/Stuckist values into film and photography.\\nIn 2008, Richards published a Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\" and the use of intuition in filmmaking. He described Remodernist film as a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\",. Point four of the manifesto is:\\n\\nThe Japanese ideas of wabi-sabi (the beauty of imperfection) and mono no aware (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.\\nThere were also criticisms of Stanley Kubrick, digital video, and Dogme 95.\\nIn late August 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto.  The filmmakers include Jesse Richards, Harris Smith, Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, Peter Rinaldi and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of the Netherlands, Rouzbeh Rashidi of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.\\nIn October 2009, with the intention \"to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts\", a series of articles by Richards, Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine MungBeing In Richards\\' two essays in the magazine, he explains the development of cinema in terms of modernism, postmodernism and remodernism, and discusses remodernist film craft as involving filmmakers \"teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft\". He also relaxes the criticisms made in the manifesto about digital video, claiming that can \"have a place in Remodernist cinema\", but with a \"new language\" and not in the way it is used now, which he says is to \"mimic film\".\\nHe describes his specific approach to Remodernist filmmaking as well:\\n\\n ... my own interests are a little more specific. I\\'m interested in Japanese aesthetics, Tarkovsky\\'s ideas on \"sculpting in time\", an emphasis on moments. But there\\'s something else I\\'ve really been thinking about lately. I believe that the most effective way to really make subjective and authentic work involves an \"addressing of the shadow\" (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, or maybe you are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child.\\nThese things, these \"shadows\" that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day – in our films, in our work, in our poetry. It\\'s necessary for us to share these parts of ourselves so we and the people we share with can grow into complete, honest human beings. Now, this kind of brutal honesty about ourselves shown through imagery that isn\\'t shy, has been explored to a degree in the work from the Cinema of Transgression, and is advocated by Antonin Artaud in his writings about the Theatre of Cruelty, and his later writings on cinema. But I don\\'t think it\\'s quite as simple as just that. As human beings, we are also full of beauty and love and poetry – we can see this in ourselves and in others and in the world around us. So this beauty must be explored as well, and in combination with the exploration of the shadow. The funny thing is that if we would just be honest as filmmakers, or painters, or as whatever we happen to work with, if we could be this honest, this approach would happen automatically. But we are told again and again- these things don\\'t go together, don\\'t tell people about that thing that you can\\'t get out of your head- that image is inappropriate. We\\'ve become very afraid of just expressing ourselves honestly, of removing the desperate attempts to appear clever, we\\'ve been afraid of showing our true selves out of fear that others will think us fools. So this is where Artaud, the Cinema of Transgression, and even Andrei Tarkovsky have not gone quite the distance. The cinematic exploration of spirituality and transgression together – pubic hair, blood and shit and love and the green grass and the dying cherry blossoms, falling snow, passing trains – every single fucking beautiful piece of life – that is what my conception of Remodernist film is.\\nThe articles also broaden the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\nFrank\\'s Wild Years, 1994/1995\\nI Wonder, 1996\\nSex and Lies, 1998 (destroyed except for trailer)\\nBlackout, 2000\\nShooting at the Moon, 1998.

              "  'On Kawara (河原温, Kawara On, December 24, 1932 – July 10, 2014) was a Japanese conceptual artist who lived in SoHo, New York City, from 1965. He took part in many solo and group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1976.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nKawara was born in Kariya, Japan on December 24, 1932. After graduating from Kariya High School in 1951, Kawara moved to Tokyo. Kawara went to Mexico in 1959, where his father was the director of an engineering company. He stayed three years, painting, attending art school and exploring the country. From 1962 to 1964 he moved back and forth between New York and Paris. He travelled through Europe before settling in 1965 in New York City, where he was an intermittent resident until his death.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nKawara belonged to a broadly international generation of Conceptual artists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Kosuth, Hanne Darboven and others, Kawara gave special prominence to language.\\n\\n\\n=== Paris-New York Drawings ===\\nFrom 1962 to 1964 Kawara made about 200 Paris-New York Drawings. Their motifs include stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter Agnes Martin. Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string.\\n\\n\\n=== Today series ===\\n\\nFrom January 4, 1966, Kawara made a long series of \"Date paintings\" (the Today series), which consist entirely of the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background. The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed (i.e., “26. ÁG. 1995,” from Reykjavík, Iceland, or “13 JUIN 2006,” from Monte Carlo); Esperanto is used when the first language of a given country does not use the Roman alphabet (“6 AŬG. 1993”, from Tokyo). The series is an example of word art.\\nThe paintings, executed in Liquitex on canvas, conform to one of eight standard sizes, ranging from 8x10 inches up to four by six feet, all horizontal in orientation. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 — three days when the world was riveted by the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\\nThe dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision, are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary; the paintings from the early years tend to have bold colors, and the more recent ones tend to be darker in tone. For example, Kawara briefly used red for several months in 1967 and then returned to darker hues until 1977. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats. Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, Kawara skillfully renders the script, initially a sans-serif, elongated version of Gill Sans, later a quintessentially modernist Futura. Each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one. When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it. When a Date Painting is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting; most clippings are from The New York Times. Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.\\nEach Date Painting is registered in a journal and marked on a One Hundred Years Calendar. When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. Under each colour is a number showing the painting\\'s sequence in that year and a letter indicating its size. The 48 journals therefore record the details of the painting\\'s size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist\\'s birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.\\n\\n\\n=== Title and postcards ===\\nMuch like the Today series, Kawara uses the number of days followed by the date the work was executed as his life-dates. So the piece entitled Title at the National Gallery of Art has Kawara\\'s life-dates as 26,697 (January 27, 2006) which, when calculated, place Kawara\\'s birthdate at December 24, 1932. Other series of works include the I Went and I Met series of postcards sent to his friends detailing aspects of his life, and a series of telegrams sent to friends and neighbors bearing the message \"I AM STILL ALIVE\". Between 1968 and 1979, On Kawara created his information series, I Got Up, in which he sent two picture postcards from his location on that morning. All of the 1,500 cards list the artist\\'s time of getting up, the date, the place of residence and the name and address of the receiver; another series of postcards, I Got Up At, was rubber-stamped with the time he got up that morning. The length of each correspondence ranged from a single card to hundreds sent consecutively over a period of months; the gesture\\'s repetitive nature is counterbalanced by the artist\\'s peripatetic global wanderings and exceedingly irregular hours (in 1973 alone he sent postcards from twenty-eight cities).\\n\\n\\n=== One Million Years ===\\n\\nOne Million Years is one of the artist\\'s best-known works about the passage and marking of time. It lists each year for the one million-year period leading up to the artwork\\'s conception and the million years that follow it. The work listing the past million years is dedicated to \"all of those who have lived and died\", and the work for the future million years is dedicated to \"the last one\". It is sometimes performed, during which pairs of performers (typically one male and one female for each segment) read dates from each list in order, simultaneously performing One Million Years [Past] and One Million Years [Future].\\nThe artwork was first made in 1969, the year of the Woodstock music festival, major civil protests against the Vietnam War and man\\'s first landing on the Moon. The first audio presentation of the reading of One Million Years occurred in 1993 during Kawara\\'s yearlong solo exhibition “One Thousand Days One Million Years” at Dia Center for the Arts in New York. Visitors could hear One Million Years [Future] being read, while viewing One Million Years [Past] and a group of date paintings. In 2002 Oliver Augst and Christoph Korn directed the radio production of the Hessischer Rundfunk of One Million Years (consisting of 32 CDs). The longest public reading from One Million Years took place at documenta 11 in 2002, where male and female participants sat side by side in a glass enclosure taking turns reading dates for the duration of the 100-day exhibition, switching between [Past] and [Future]. In 2004, the project traveled to Trafalgar Square in London for a continuous outdoor reading lasting 7 days and 7 nights. Since then, readings and recordings have taken place in cities around the world.\\n\\n\\n=== One-hundred-year calendars ===\\nFor his one-hundred-year calendars, Kawara, starting with the date of his birth, systematically marks each day of his life with a yellow dot on the calendars, and registers a completed date painting with a green dot (red dots signify that more than one painting was completed on that given day).\\n\\n\\n=== Pure Consciousness ===\\nIn Pure Consciousness, a traveling exhibition initiated in 1998, Kawara lent seven Date paintings (January 1 to January 7, 1997) to kindergartens and schools in Madagascar, Australia, Bhutan, Côte d\\'Ivoire, Colombia, Turkey, Japan, Finland, Iceland, Israel, Canada and the United States. At all schools they hang in classrooms, bearing dates that fall within the lifespans of the children.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nKawara\\'s first exhibitions include the first Nippon Exhibition, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, in 1953, and at the Takemiya and Hibiya galleries the following year. His work was exhibited at New York\\'s Dwan Gallery in 1967, and his one-person exhibition \"One Million Years\" was shown in Düsseldorf, Paris, and Milan in 1971. Kawara\\'s work was included in documenta 5 (1972), 7 (1982), and 11 (2002), in Kassel, and in the Tokyo Biennale (1970), the Kyoto Biennale (1976), and the Venice Biennale (1976).\\nHis work has been included in many conceptual art surveys from the seminal Information show at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1970 to Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 1995. Solo exhibitions of his work have included the Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles, and the Centre Pompidou, Paris, in 1977; Continuity/Discontinuity at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm in 1980; Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1991; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York in 1993; and the Dallas Museum of Art.\\nKawara\\'s first comprehensive retrospective, “On Kawara—Silence” at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, was installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by himself. Two years before his death, the artist offered the exhibition curator Jeffrey Weiss a list of oblique titles—including “48 Years,” “Self-Observation” and “Monologue”—for each of the sections. The exhibition was held February 6 through May 3, 2015, and also featured a live reading of Kawara\\'s “One Million Years.”\\n\\n\\n== Artist books ==\\nKawara created several artist\\'s books:\\n\\nOne Million Years, 1999, Editions Micheline Szwajcer & Michèle Didier (2 Volumes)\\nI MET, 2004, Editions Micheline Szwajcer & Michèle Didier (12 Volumes)\\nI WENT, 2007, mfc-michèle didier (12 Volumes)\\nI GOT UP, 2008, mfc-michèle didier (12 Volumes)\\nTrilogy, 2008, mfc-michèle didier (3x12 Volumes)\\nI READ, 2017, mfc-michèle didier (6 Volumes)\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2007, one of Kawara\\'s \"Date Paintings\" was sold for $1.8 million at Christie\\'s New York. Another date painting, May 1, 1987, set an auction record for Kawara when it sold for almost $2 million at Christie\\'s New York in 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nKawara died in New York on July 10, 2014, at the age of 81. Kawara\\'s published obituaries state that he was alive for 29,771 days rather than giving dates of birth and death. Kawara\\'s ″100 Years Calendar″ indicates that he was born on December 24, 1932, not on 2 January 1933, as was officially recorded. This would make the date of his death, June 27, 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Influences on contemporary artists ==\\nonKawaraUpdate (v2) (2007) by American art collective MTAA updates and automates (via software) the process-oriented nature of On Kawara\\'s date paintings.\\nAmerican artist Eric Doeringer has recreated a number of On Kawara\\'s projects *\\n\"The Disjunction of Time\" is a slideshow installation by Mexican artist Mario Garcia Torres, that delve into the Montecarlo Hotel in Mexico City, here Kawara stayed for late periods in the 1960´s and where the \"I Got Up\" series stared. The audiovisual work is largely informed by Kawara´s ideas.</ref> \\n</ref> including making Today paintings with his own birthday as part of his Bootleg series. From February 6 - May 3, 2015 (concurrent with the exhibition On Kawara - Silence at the Solomon R.

              "  'Jack Albert Youngerman (March 25, 1926 – February 19, 2020) was an American artist known for his constructions and paintings.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nJack Youngerman was born in 1926 in Webster Groves, Missouri, moving to Louisville, Kentucky in 1929 with his family. He studied art at the University of North Carolina from 1944 to 1946 under a wartime navy training program, and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1947. In the fall of 1947, Youngerman moved to Paris on a G.I. Scholarship; he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he studied with Jean Souverbie. He traveled to the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Greece, to visit art museums and historic sites. In 1948, he formed a lifelong friendship with Ellsworth Kelly and also met Eduardo Paolozzi and César, each fellow students at Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn 1950, Youngerman had his first group exhibition, Les Mains eblouies at Galerie Maeght in Paris, which also included Pierre Alechinsky, Eduardo Chillida and Corneille. He visited the studios of Constantin Brancusi and Jean Arp with Kelly, and found himself influenced by their sense of organic form. He met Alexander Calder through his father-in-law, Henri Seyrig, a renowned archaeologist and cultural attache to the Free French delegation to the United States. During this time he became interested in the resurgence of geometric abstraction in Paris, especially in exhibitions such as Salon des Réalités Nouvelles which included Max Bill, Auguste Herbin and Richard Lohse. Youngerman also visited the Salon de Mai to see the most current work of the School of Paris artists, among them such masters as Henri Matisse. Youngerman\\'s exposure to the contemporary art in post-war France was critical to his development; he introduced aspects of geometric abstraction and Constructivism into his painting.\\nIn 1951 he mounted his first one-person exhibition at Galerie Arnaud in Paris. During this time he met the French artist, Francois Morellet, with whom he developed a life-long friendship. A few years later he travelled to visit Henri Seyrig in Beirut, then Director of Institut Francais d\\'Archeologie. In 1954 Youngerman was commissioned by the architect Michel Ecochard to create a color design for the College Protestant Français in Beirut.\\nIn 1956 he designed sets for the French actor and director, Jean-Louis Barrault\\'s production of Georges Schehaed\\'s Histoire de Vasco. The American art dealer Betty Parsons visited Youngerman\\'s Paris studio that summer, where she encouraged him to move to New York City.\\nIn December 1956, he returned to the U.S. with his wife, Delphine Seyrig, and son; they rented a space in lower Manhattan\\'s Coenties Slip, an area of largely abandoned loft buildings that would become a legendary artists\\' colony. There his friends and neighbors included Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, and Robert Rauschenberg.\\nYoungerman\\'s first one-person show at Betty Parsons Gallery marked his 1958 New York City debut. His development was unique among his peers, with elemental forms and fluid contours that marked his canvasses through the 1950s with imagery often emanating from a central core. Early in his growth the forms were organic; sometimes botanical in nature. He worked in thick black pigment as if it resided within the color spectrum.\\nHis career continued its ascent with exhibitions at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In 1959, Youngerman was featured alongside Johns, Frank Stella, and Kelly in Sixteen Americans, a landmark exhibition curated by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art. Between 1961 and 1968, Youngerman exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Galerie Lawrence in Paris, Galleria dell\\'Arte in Milan, Everett Ellin Gallery in Los Angeles, the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, and The Phillips Collection in Washington, DC. In 1968, he established a studio in Bridgehampton, New York, settling there full-time in 1995. In 1976, Youngerman received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. \\nIn 2019, Youngerman premiered a body of work titled \"Cut-Ups\" at Washburn Gallery in New York City. His final exhibition, Jack Youngerman, \"Works on Paper,\" 1954 - 2019, took place at The Drawing Room in East Hampton, NY.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nJack Youngerman was the recipient of numerous awards from organizations including the National Council of Arts and Sciences, United States / Japan Exchange Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, National Academy of Design, the American Academy in Rome, Guild Hall Museum Lifetime Achievement Award, the Barnett and Annalee Newman Foundation, and the Lee Krasner Award/Pollock-Krasner Foundation.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1950, Youngerman married the French actress Delphine Seyrig (1932–1990).\\nYoungerman died of complications from a fall in Stony Brook, New York on February 19, 2020, at the age of 93. He is survived by wife, Hilary Helfant, son Duncan (and partner Sunniva), and grandchildren Selina, Dylan, Marlon, and Errol.\\nFrank Stella said of his friend Youngerman, \"I miss Jack and I miss the enthusiasm and touch that made his paintings so striking. It was as though beauty was imprinted into the canvas of our time.\" February 20, 2020\\n\\n\\n=== Public collections ===\\nYoungerman\\'s art is represented in public and private collections across the globe, including:\\n\\nBoca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, FL\\nCarnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA\\nColumbus Museum of Art, Columbus, OH\\nDenver Art Museum, Denver, CO\\nEdith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, Portland, OR\\nFrederick R.

              "  'Martin Creed (born 21 October 1968) is a British artist, composer and performer. He won the Turner Prize in 2001 for exhibitions during the preceding year, with the jury praising his audacity for exhibiting a single installation, Work No. 227: The lights going on and off, in the Turner Prize show. Creed lives and works in London.\\n\\n\\n== Life and education ==\\nMartin Creed was born in Wakefield, England. He moved with his family to Glasgow at age 3 when his silversmith father got a job teaching there. He grew up revering art and music. His parents were Quakers, and he was taken often to Quaker meetings. He attended Lenzie Academy, and studied art at the Slade School of Art at University College London from 1986 to 1990. Since then he has lived in London, apart from a period (2000—2004) living in Alicudi, an island off Sicily in the South of Italy. He currently lives and works back in London. He is a vegan.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nFilms, installations, paintings, theatre and live-action sculptures are all characteristic of his work. Making use of whatever medium seems suitable. Since 1987 he has numbered each of his works, and most of his titles are descriptive: for example Work No. 79: some Blu-tack kneaded, rolled into a ball and depressed against a wall (1993) and Work No. 88, a sheet of A4 paper crumpled into a ball (1995). Creed\\'s work Work No. 200: Half the air in a given space (1998) is a room which has half of its cubic space filled with balloons.\\n\\n\\n=== Projects ===\\nCreed won the 2001 Turner Prize for two exhibitions, Martin Creed Works and Art Now: Martin Creed shown across England during the preceding year. His submission for the Turner Prize show at the Tate Gallery was Work No. 227: The lights going on and off. The work was an empty room in which the lights switched on and off at 5-second intervals. As so often with the Turner Prize, this created a great deal of press attention, most of it questioning whether something as minimalist as this could be considered art at all. Nevertheless, the jury praised this work, saying they \"admired the audacity in presenting a single work in the exhibition and noted its strength, rigour, wit and sensitivity to the site\". His work has often excited controversy: a visitor threw eggs at the walls of Creed\\'s empty room as a protest against the prize, declaring that Creed\\'s presentations were not real art and that \"painting is in danger of becoming an extinct skill in this country\". In recent years Creed has been exhibiting paintings in nearly every exhibition he has done.\\nWork No. 1197: All the bells in the country rung as quickly and as loudly as possible for three minutes was commissioned to herald the start of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\\nIn 2009, he wrote and choreographed Work No. 1020: Ballet, a live performance of Creed\\'s music, ballet, words and film, originally produced by Sadler\\'s Wells, London and performed in the Lilian Baylis Studio. In 2010, Work No. 1020: Ballet was performed at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and at The Kitchen, New York, in December 2013. Work No. 1020 was also performed in 2014 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in connection with Creed\\'s retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, London. He designed an artpiece for Victoria Beckham\\'s store on Dover Street in Mayfair, London in 2015.\\nMany of his works are on free public view, like the Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh, DON\\'T WORRY at St Peter\\'s Church, Cologne, The singing lifts at The Royal Festival Hall, London, and also at the Centro Botin in Santander, and the huge spinning sign MOTHERS on a roof in Fort Worth, Texas.\\nMany works too are in Museum collections worldwide, from the floor work at Colleccion Jumex in Mexico City (permanently installed) to The lights going on and off at the Museum of Modern Art New York.\\nSome of his works have not just been on display, but originated as the converted space of an art hall working with the concurrent art hall both from the inside and from the outside. One such work is Work No. 1000 (installation art hall) which consists of an art hall filled to the brink with Creed\\'s prints made with broccoli.\\nCreed continues to exhibit work internationally and regularly gives talks and plays live with his band.\\n\\n\\n=== Permanent installations ===\\n \\nCreed\\'s Work No. 975 EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT, was installed on the facade of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in November 2009. Although Work No. 975 is a unique sculpture, the phrase has been used on several related works, each assigned its own work number. Previous to Work No. 975, a red neon text appeared in New York\\'s Times Square (Work No.225 1999, commissioned by Public Art Fund), a thirty-metre-long version was installed in Detroit (Work No.790 2007), and another text in white neon ran the 23 metre length of the Rennie Museum\\'s façade in Vancouver\\'s Chinatown (Work No.851 2008). Most recently, a 46-metre multicoloured version was commissioned for Christchurch Art Gallery, in the advent of its reopening after almost five years of earthquake-related closure.\\nIn 2011, Creed was commissioned by Fruitmarket Gallery to make a work as part of the restoration of the historic Scotsman Steps in Edinburgh. Creed\\'s Work No. 1059 was subsequently installed, cladding each of the 104 steps and landings in a different type of marble. Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones called it \"a generous, modest masterpiece of contemporary public art\".\\nIn 2012, Creed was the first artist to participate in the long-term programme of artist-conceived restaurants at Sketch, London. Together with a series of paintings and wall drawings, Creed specifically created Work No. 1343 where every single piece of cutlery, glass, chair and table was different and brought together a mix of the mass-produced and hand-crafted, from classic antiques to contemporary design from all around the world. Work No. 1347, still on display at the restaurant, consists of 96 different types of marble, in a herringbone formation across the floor.\\nIn 2019, Work No. 2950: WHATEVER was placed on the roof of a building in Auckland, New Zealand. It is a large multicoloured neon sign showing the word “WHATEVER”.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nCreed\\'s first band, Owada, was formed in 1994 with Adam McEwen and Keiko Owada. In 1997, they released their first CD, Nothing, on David Cunningham\\'s Piano label. Sound has also featured in his gallery-based work, with pieces using doorbells, drum machines and metronomes. Since 1999 he has not used the band name \"Owada\". In 2000, he published a recording of his songs titled I Can\\'t Move under his own name with the arts publisher Art Metropole, in Toronto.\\nIn 2010, he provided the cover art for a Futuristic Retro Champions single, while supporting its launch with an appearance with his own band with Keiko Owada on bass, Genevieve Murphy on keyboards, Ben Kane on drums and Anouchka Grose on steel guitar.[1]\\nCreed started his own label, Telephone Records, and released the single \"Thinking/ Not Thinking\" in early 2011, following it up with the single \"Where You Go\" in 2012. Releases accelerated in 2012, with the Double AA Side single \"Fuck Off\" and \"Die\" coming out on Moshi Moshi Records in May 2012, in advance of the album Love To You, released on Moshi Moshi in July 2012. The album is produced by David Cunningham, Martin Creed and The Nice NIce Boys (Andrew Knowles of Johnny Marr & The Healers and Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand). The Vinyl Factory worked with Creed to produce a limited edition of the release which featured hand-painted covers by Creed. The single \"You\\'re The One For Me\" came out at the same time as the album.\\nJanuary 2014 saw the release Mind Trap, an album that featured songs alongside instrumental pieces for orchestra. Creed sings and plays the instruments, supported by gospel singers Dee Alexander and Yvonne Gage (who have worked with The Police, Madonna and R.Kelly) and Andy Knowles (musical credits include stints with the Fiery Furnaces & Franz Ferdinand) playing drums on If You\\'re Lonely, You Return and Don\\'t Tell Me. Keiko Owada plays bass on Gift Attack / Don\\'t Won\\'t. Co-produced by Martin with Andy Knowles, the album was recorded in London, Chicago and the Czech Republic. Nick McCarthy of Franz Ferdinand and Mark Ralph (who works with Hot Chip) provided additional production. The Chicago songs, which form the heart of the album, were recorded all-analogue at John McEntire\\'s (Tortoise) Soma Studios. Engineered by Bill Skibbe (The Kills/Franz Ferdinand). It also includes 3 specially commissioned orchestral works: Work No. 955 was originally written for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Work No. 994 was composed for the Hiroshima Symphony Orchestra and Work No. 1375 was commissioned by the London Sinfonietta. These pieces were recorded for the album by the Brno Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mikel Toms. All lyrics and music on the album are written by Martin Creed, with the exception of the New Shutters which is Martin\\'s arrangement of a traditional Neapolitan folk song. The album sleeve features one of Martin\\'s paintings, Work No. 1674: Anouchka and was designed by Andy Knowles, who has recently directed videos for Franz Ferdinand and The Cribs. Martin Creed is also much loved by Franz Ferdinand - regular attendees at his gigs and co-producers on his album \\'Mind Trap\\' -  as well as Moshi Moshi label-mates Slow Club.\\nA new body of audiovisual work was released in late November 2015 in response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The double A-side single “Let Them In / Border Control” was made available via Telephone Records as free downloads on SoundCloud. Both songs are accompanied by videos which Creed made himself.\\nIn July 2016, Martin Creed released a new album entitled Thoughts Lined Up. The album includes the singles \"Understanding\" and \"Princess Taxi Girl\" for which accompanying videos have been released.\\n\\n\\n=== Discography ===\\n\\n\\n=== On art ===\\nIn an interview published in the 2002 book Art Now: Interviews with Modern Artists, Creed explains that he used to \\'make paintings\\' but never liked having to decide what to paint. He decided to stop making paintings and instead to think about what it meant, and why he wanted to make things. He says:\\n\\nThe only thing I feel like I know is that I want to make things. Other than that, I feel like I don’t know. So the problem is in trying to make something without knowing what I want. [...] I think it’s all to do with wanting to communicate. I mean, I think I want to make things because I want to communicate with people, because I want to be loved, because I want to express myself.\\nCreed says that he makes art works not as part of an academic exploration of \\'conceptual\\' art, but rather from a wish to connect with people, \\'wanting to communicate and wanting to say hello\\'. The work is therefore primarily emotional:\\n\\nTo me it’s emotional. Aye. To me that’s the starting point. I mean, I do it because I want to make something. I think that’s a desire, you know, or a need. I think that I recognise that I want to make something, and so I try to make something. But then you get to thinking about it and that’s where the problems start because you can’t help thinking about it, wondering whether it’s good or bad. But to me it’s emotional more than anything else.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1996, Richard Long and Roger Ackling selected Creed to exhibit at EASTinternational. In the decade since winning the Turner Prize he has exhibited extensively throughout the world, including large survey shows at Trussardi Foundation, Milan (\\'I Like Things\\'), Bard College, New York (\\'Feelings\\'), and a touring exhibition which started at Ikon Gallery Birmingham and toured to Hiroshima and Seoul. \\n\\nThe first major survey show of Creed\\'s, \\'What\\'s the point of it?\\', took place at the Hayward Gallery, London, in January 2014. The exhibition included a number of his best-known works, from the installation Work No. 227 The Lights Going On and Off (2000), Work No. 293 A sheet of paper crumpled into a ball (2003), to his epic sculpture Work No. 1092 MOTHERS (2011). Coinciding with the exhibition at the Hayward, the Southbank Centre commissioned Martin to compose a new piece for the Royal Festival Hall organ, resulting in Work No. 1815, a performance alongside some of J.S Bach\\'s greatest organ works.\\nCreed\\'s largest survey show to date took place at Park Avenue Armory, New York from June - August 2016, curated by Tom Eccles and Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Entitled ’The Back Door,’ using both the Wade Thompson Drill Hall and the historic interiors of the building, the show brought together a sequence of works from Creed\\'s more than 20-year career.\\nIn 2017 he had an exposition in Museum Voorlinden in the Netherlands titled Say Cheese. In this exhibition he showed a wall with 1000 broccoli prints in various colors, he filled a room with blue balloons for walking through. In another room he showed many metronomes were ticking at different speeds.\\nIn 2019, the Centro Botín Centre held an exhibition called Amigos. It ran from 6 April to 9 June and features several new installations including one put amongst some trees which surround the building.\\nIn 2019, the Museum of Recent Art held an exhibition called Thinking / Not Thinking. It ran from 12 February to 2 May and features several installations.\\n\\n\\n== Notes and references ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial site\\nArtkrush.com interview with Martin Creed (April 2006)',\n",
              "  'Richard Jackson is an American contemporary artist born in 1939 in Sacramento. He now lives in Los Angeles, California.\\nHe studied Art and Engineering at Sacramento State College from 1959–1961 and taught Sculpture and New Forms at UCLA Los Angeles 1989 – 1994.\\nSince the 1970s Jackson has developed in his work an interrogation of painting that combines conceptual procedures, humour and extreme disorder. He expands the activity of painting, abandons its traditional instruments for machines, vehicles and everyday objects. For this reason he has been referred to as a Neo-Dadaist.\\nJackson has brought the material dimensions of painting to extremes. \"Big Ideas\" from 1981 consisted of hundreds of painted canvases stacked into a sphere of 5 meters in diameter. His exhibition, The Maid\\'s Room / The Dining Room (2007) is a tribute to Marcel Duchamp\\'s last major work: Etant donnés.\\nIn 1999 he exhibited at the 48th Venice Biennale.\\nJackson\\'s recent solo exhibitions include \\'Accidents in Abstract Painting\\' at The Armory Center for the Arts, Pasadena CA, (2012), where Jackson flew and crashed a radio-controlled, model military plane with a fifteen-foot wingspan, filled with paint, into a twenty-foot wall that read “accidents in abstract painting.” The spectacle, free and open to the public, took place at Pasadena’s Arroyo Seco.  In 2013, he was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Orange County Museum of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHis exhibitions include Richard Jackson: Installations 1970–1988 at the Menil Collection, Houston, TX.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              "  'El Anatsui (; born 4 February 1944) is a Ghanaian sculptor active for much of his career in Nigeria. He has drawn particular international attention for his \"bottle-top installations\". These installations consist of thousands of aluminum pieces sourced from alcohol recycling stations and sewn together with copper wire, which are then transformed into metallic cloth-like wall sculptures. Such materials, while seemingly stiff and sturdy, are actually free and flexible, which often helps with manipulation when installing his sculptures. \\nAnatsui was included in the 2023 Time 100 list of the world\\'s most influential people.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nEl Anatsui was  born in Anyako, in the Volta Region of Ghana. The youngest of his father\\'s 32 children, Anatsui lost his mother and was raised by his uncle. His first experience with art was through drawing letters on a chalkboard. His lettering attempts drew the attention of his school\\'s headmaster, who encouraged his effort by providing him with more chalk. Because of his age at the time (just after kindergarten), he regarded the letters more as images than as letters--the forms interested him.\\nAnatsui received his B.A in 1968 from the College of Art and Built Environment (KNUST) in Kumasi, Ghana. He received his postgraduate diploma in Art Education the following year, in 1969, from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), also in Kumasi.\\nSome of his early artistic influences include Oku Ampofo, Vincent Akwete Kofi, and Kofi Antubam, all of whom began to reject foreign influences in their practices in favor of indigenous art forms. After graduating in 1969, Anatsui assumed a teaching position at Winneba Specialist Training College (now University of Education), a role that had previously been filled by Kofi.\\n\\nHe began teaching at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1975. He became a senior lecturer for the Fine and Applied Arts department in 1982, and later became head of that department and full professor of sculpture in 1996, a role he occupied until 2011. His presence at the University of Nsukka led to his affiliation with the Nsukka group.It has taken many years to find artists who can occupy a prominent place on the global circuit while choosing to reside outside the metropolitan centres. William Kentridge has made his reputation from Johannesburg, and El Anatsui has conquered the planet while living and working in the Nigerian university town of Nsukka.\\n\\n\\n== Artwork ==\\nAnatsui notes that, through school and in university, \"everything we were doing was western,\" especially within the fine arts department of his university; he felt that there was something missing in his education for its lack of focus on his own culture. In order to rectify this, he started visiting the National Cultural Centre of Ghana, also in Kumasi, to engage with the musicians, graphic artists, textile artists, printers, and creative artists of all types. It was there that he encountered Adinkra, a system of signs and symbols, which was his first introduction to abstract art and opened up a new world of artistic possibilities for him.\\nIn the 1970s, Anatsui worked frequently in wood. He was particularly interested in wooden trays, which he often saw used in the markets to display food items and other wares--he would carve them or engrave them with Adinkra symbols and other marks using hot rods. He also began using wood to construct wall panels from strips placed next to each other, the surface decorated with designs imparted on the material through the use of chain saws, gouges, flame, or paint.  In the late 70s, he began working in clay: pots, in particular, exploring themes of fragility and dilapidation. He was interested in how, even after a pot breaks and ceases being used in the way we commonly think (for food, water), it takes on a new purpose, even acquires more uses, from the mundane to the spiritual. Most intriguing to him is the use of pot shards for presenting offerings. He said, \"It\\'s as if the pot, having broken, is transformed into a dimension which makes it ideal for use by ancestors and deities who are themselves in the spirit dimension.\"\\nAfter his work with the broken pots, Anatsui explored food-adjacent themes in other materials: wood, again, in the form of mortars; equipment used to process cassava, and bottle tops.\\n\\nMuch of Anatsui\\'s work features found materials, or materials that had a life of use prior to being formed into this artworks. His emphasis on the found object, however, is less Duchampian, and more focused on the history of use and the evidence of the human hand in the material. \"When something has been used, there is a certain charge, a certain energy, that has to do with the people who have touched it and used it and sometimes abused it. This helps to direct what one is doing, and also to root what one is doing in the environment and the culture.\"Metal bottle caps are a favorite material of his; like cloth, Anatsui describes, an arrangement of bottle caps is versatile, allowing him to consider his art both sculpturally (through the form of the caps) and in a painterly manner (through the colors of the caps). Further, he appreciates the glimpse that bottle caps give into current and historical political and sociological issues, by virtue of the names and colors of various drink brands that are printed onto the caps.\"The most important thing for me is the transformation. The fact that  these media, each identifying a brand of drink, are no longer going back to serve the same role but are elements that could generate some reflection, some thinking, or just some wonder. This is possible because they are removed from their accustomed, functional context into a new one, and they bring along their histories and identities.\"A number of themes are present in Anatsui\\'s work: the destruction and subsequent reconstitution of material as a metaphor for life and the changes Africa faced under colonialism and since independence; traditional themes and motifs of West African strip woven cloth and other African textiles; and concern over Western scholarly misinterpretation of African history and the distortions it has caused. His work is also thematically connected to the West African cultural landscape and ideas of consumption and labor.\\nThe idea of Sankofa [translated as \"go back and retrieve\"] is also present in Anatsui\\'s work. He views it as a way of drawing on the past, the lessons it offers, to chart a mode of moving forward. For him, Sankofa described a need to draw from what was immediately around him; Ghana became independent when he was in high school, and much of his education had been focused on western art and art history, and so he felt called to \\'go back and retrieve\\' aspects of Ghanaian culture that had been suppressed, something he described as a sort of \"quest for self-discovery.\"\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nAnatsui\\'s career grew gradually, starting in his home village of Nsukka before branching off to places such as Enugu and Lagos, and eventually internationally. In 1990, Anatsui had his first important group show at the Studio Museum In Harlem, New York. He also was one of three artists singled out in the 1990 exhibition \"Contemporary African Artists: Changing Traditions\", which was extended for five years.\\nAnatsui has since exhibited his work around the world, including at the Brooklyn Museum (2013); the Clark Art Institute (2011); the Rice University Art Gallery, Houston (2010); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2008–09); the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (2008); the Fowler Museum at UCLA (2007); the Venice Biennale (1990 and 2007); the Hayward Gallery (2005); the Liverpool Biennial (2002); the National Museum of African Art (2001); the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona (2001); the 8th Osaka Sculpture Triennale (1995); the 5th Gwangju Biennale (2004); the Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha (2019); and the Kunstmuseum Bern (2020).\\nIn 1995, Anatsui held his first solo exhibition outside of Africa in London. He expressed a variety of themes and demonstrated how African art can be shown in a multitude of ways that are not seen as \"typical\" African. His work utilized conceptual modes used by European and American artists but hardly in African countries. Anatsui showed his work at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in 2005. This was his first time \"appear[ing] as part of the permanent collection in a major art museum\". Also in 2005, his exhibition at New York\\'s Skoto Gallery, \"Danudo,\" was the first display of his metal sheets in an American city. At this gallery, Skoto Aghahowa presented Anatsui\\'s wood wall panels alongside Sol LeWitt\\'s drawings. This exhibition popularized his bottle-cap works as he gained more recognition in the press.\\n\\nAnatsui was invited to the Venice Biennale in 2006 and again in 2007 where he was commissioned to make two hanging metal tapestries. During the 2007 edition, he exhibited his works at the Palazzo Fortuny which consisted of newly built walls for him to display three metal hangings entitled Dusasa. Each artwork demonstrated different textures and colors including golds, reds, and blacks. The way the bottle tops draped throughout the hangings created a sense of gentleness that made it stand apart from the other works in the gallery. The art curator of the Biennale, Robert Storr, mentions that the artist\\'s series \"reaches back into a whole series of things in the postwar period-it has a kind of exaltation I have not seen before\". During this Venetian showing, Anatsui wanted to create a new experience for his viewers conceptually. He believes that \"human life is not something which is cut and dried. It is something that is constantly in a state of change.\" At this point, he began to refer his metalworks as hangings instead of \"cloths\".\\n\\nA 2010 retrospective of his work, entitled When I Last Wrote to You About Africa, was organized by the Museum for African Art and opened at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It subsequently toured venues in the United States for three years, concluding at the University of Michigan Museum of Art.\\nA major exhibition of recent works, entitled Gravity & Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui, had its New York premiere at the Brooklyn Museum in 2013. Organized by the Akron Art Museum (exhibition: 2012), the exhibition later traveled to the Des Moines Art Center (2013–14) and the Bass Museum of Art in Miami (2014).\\nA career-spanning survey of his work, organized by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu, entitled Triumphant Scale drew record-breaking crowds when it opened, in March 2019 at Munich\\'s Haus der Kunst. From there, the show travelled to the Arab Museum of Modern Art, in Doha, and later to the Kunstmuseum Bern in 2020.\\nAnatsui was selected for the 2023 Hyundai Commission at the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern; a vast display space for large-scale sculptural and site-specific artworks. His work, \"Behind the Red Moon,\" is made of thousands of metal bottle tops and fragments, building upon his work with materials linked to the transatlantic slave trade, and will be on view through April 14, 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nAnatsui was selected to be a member of the International Society for Education through Art (InSEA) world council in 1992 for his work in education. Anatsui was a founding member and fellow of the Forum for African Arts in 2000. That year he also became a member of the International Selection Committee for the Dakar Biennale in Senegal. In 2001 he was a fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\nAnatsui won an honorable mention at the First Ghana National Art Competition as an undergraduate student in 1968. The following year he was awarded the Best Student of the Year at the College of Art in Kumasi, Ghana. In 1983 he won a commission for two large public sculptures made of terrazzo-surfaced cement on the Nsukka campus. He was selected to be one of ten artists invited to the Zweites Symposium Nordesekkuste residency in Cuxhaven, West Germany, in 1984.\\nIn 1990, Anatsui was invited to the 44th annual Venice Biennale show 5 Contemporary African Artists, where he received an honorable mention. That year he was included in the American documentary Nigerian Art-Kindred Spirits.\\nIn 2015, the Venice Biennale awarded Anatsui the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. In 2017, Anatsui was awarded the Praemium Imperiale, the first Ghanaian to win this international art prize.\\nOther awards include:\\n\\n1990 – Public Prize, 7th Annual Triennale der Kleinplastik\\n1995 – Kansai Telecasting Prize, 6th Osaka Sculpture Triennial\\n1998 – Bronze Prize, 9th Osaka Sculpture Triennial\\n2008 – Visionaries!

              "  'Nick Cave (born February 4, 1959) is an American sculptor, dancer, performance artist, and professor. He is best known for his Soundsuit series: wearable assemblage fabric sculptures that are bright, whimsical, and other-worldly, often made with found objects. He also trained as a dancer with Alvin Ailey and often incorporates dance and performance into his works. His later sculptures have focused on color theory and included mixed media and large-scale installations.  He lives in Chicago, Illinois, and directs the graduate fashion program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He continues to work on Soundsuits as well as works completed as a sculptor, dancer, and performance artist.\\nHis first career retrospective museum exhibition opened in May 2022 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and is currently on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, through April 2023. He received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Rhode Island School of Design in June 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNick Cave was raised in Fulton, Missouri, alongside seven brothers by a single mother who encouraged Cave\\'s interest in fashion. His grandparents owned a farm in Chariton, Missouri, where Cave would sometimes help care for crops and chickens. He attributes much of his interests in found objects and assemblage to his childhood circumstances. Graduating from Hickman High School in 1977, he enrolled in the Kansas City Art Institute, where he would study fiber arts and later earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1982. In 1979, Cave met Alvin Ailey and spent that summer and several summers thereafter in New York, where he studied with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.  After graduating from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1982, he designed displays for the department store, Macy\\'s, and worked professionally as a fashion designer while maintaining his interest in art and dance.\\nIn 1988, Cave earned his M.F.A. degree from Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. He also did some graduate coursework at the University of North Texas. After graduating from Cranbrook, he went on to teach in a fiber arts program at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989. Since then, Cave has run a clothing company in Chicago where he designs, manufactures, and markets his own line of men\\'s & women\\'s clothing.\\n\\n\\n== Creative thought and process ==\\nCave\\'s low socio-economic status growing up forced him to repair hand-me-downs from older siblings. He learned to sew, which led to his first Soundsuit. Up until then, his work had nothing to do with the figure or performance art. He explained that he made a sudden shift that would redefine the work he was making.\\nInfluences of African art traditions, armor, ceremonial dress, couture fashion, and designed textiles, as well as stereotypically feminine objects, are present in his work to express a multitude of concepts. Much of his work is in the round, but occasionally he enjoys the dimension created when working with bas-relief, referring to them as paintings. His work deals with strategies to negotiate the real-life stakes of vulnerability and consequence by transforming the experience and environment. With his performance art, he aims to create situations where diverse communities come together to share the experience, making sure to distinguish his pieces as art rather than costumes. Cave describes himself not as an artist but as a messenger as his work frequently deals with spectacle and responsibility. One such work of his that follows this principle is Augment. This piece consists of five assemblages made with more than 1,000 inflatable lawn decorations that are sewn together. The sculptures were on display in the Cyclorama at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston\\'s South End from August 8, 2019, to September 13, 2019. On September 14, the piece was taken to the streets in the form of a parade with the mission to spread joy through the South End and Upham\\'s Corner neighborhoods in Boston. More than 75 Boston-area artists and performers and 500 members of the public participated in this parade to bridge the gap between the two neighborhoods. At its final location at 555 Columbia Avenue in Upham\\'s corner, the piece spills out through the windows of a custom-designed building wrapped in collages made by members of the Upham\\'s Corner community.\\nCave creates most of his pieces in a workshop with several assistants, fabricators, and suppliers, his head assistant being Jen Grygiel. Cave most often commissions fabrication from a shop in Skokie, Illinois, called \"Iron and Wire\" owned by David Greene.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Soundsuits ===\\n\\nSoundsuits are sculptural costumes enveloping the wearer\\'s body in materials including but not limited to dyed human hair, sisal, plastic buttons, beads, wire, sequins, and feathers. Soundsuits camouflage the body, masking and creating a second skin that conceals race, gender, and class, forcing the viewer to look without judgment. In using everyday objects, Cave can create an atmosphere of familiarity while rearranging the objects into interpretive representations of both social and material culture. As race, identity, and gender are generally accepted to form the axis of his work, Cave\\'s soundsuits can telegraph many concepts simultaneously. Their meaning can therefore change based on their environment, movement, fixed state, and/or the inclusion of group choreography. The finished pieces bear some resemblance to African ceremonial costumes and masks. The suits also reference carnival costumes, Dogon costumes, Rococo, and ball culture.\\nCave\\'s first soundsuit was created in 1992, as a reaction to the beating of Rodney King. Cave collected a large number of sticks and twigs from the ground and fashioned them into a suit that, to his surprise, made sounds when worn. His suits are most often presented for public viewing as static sculptures, but they are also observed through live performance, video, and photography. Bringing his interactive creations to life, \"Cave regularly performs in the sculptures himself, dancing either before the public or for the camera, activating their full potential as costume, musical instrument, and living icon.\" He has produced more than 500 soundsuits, since the creation of his first in 1992. He is very much inspired by dance and choreography, which works well with soundsuits because they allow the expression of both arts in one piece. He talks about how he wants his work to be seen without the artist in mind. With the Soundsuits series, the viewer doesn\\'t know the identity, gender, or race of the wearer.\\nIn 2021, Cave was commissioned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York to create a permanent installation inspired by his soundsuits spanning the Times Square-42nd Street and 42nd Street-Bryant Park subway stations. The work, Each One, Every One, Equal All (2021), consists of a series of mosaic tile murals of imagined and real soundsuits and mobiles created by Cave, along with video installations of the soundsuits in motion. Writing about the installation in The New York Times before its completion in 2022, critic John Vincler described the figures in the work as \"joyous\" and said the piece \"feels like a necessary correction, right at home amid the noise and teem\" of the subway. \\nOne of these Soundsuits was chosen by Peter Gabriel to represent his song \"Live and Let Live\", the final single on his eighth album i/o, released in 2023.\\n\\n\\n=== HEARD•NY – Soundsuit performance ===\\nIn 2013, Cave worked with the dancers of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company, in which he was formerly a dancer, and created HEARD•NY. This performance took place in one of the city\\'s most bustling thoroughfares, Grand Central Terminal\\'s Vanderbilt Hall. HEARD•NY was not a purely visual spectacle, but a layered commentary on ceremony (particularly, costumed West African ritual), identity, and the place of dreams in civic life. \\nA herd of 30 colorful life-size horses broke into choreographed movement—or “crossings”— twice a day for just a week and was accompanied by live music. Each suit, made of brightly-colored synthetic raffia, was operated by two dancers from the Alvin Ailey Dance Company. The project was presented by Creative Time and MTA Arts for Transit as part of a series of events celebrating the centennial of Grand Central. Cave\\'s soundsuits were created to be seen in motion. \\nChoreographed performances such as these show the audience what the soundsuits look and sound like in their true form. Soundsuit sculpture is part of Colección SOLO museum and is showed as part of its permanent exhibition and was part of different temporal exhibitions, such Certeza (2023), at its museum in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n=== Mixed media ===\\nCave\\'s works outside of his soundsuits are predominantly mixed-media sculptures and large-scale installations that use found objects and brightly colored fabrics. He creates sculptural art that discusses current racial tensions, especially gun violence and its impact on Black men. One such piece is TM 13, a sculpture that responds to the life and 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. After George Zimmerman was acquitted of Martin\\'s murder on July 13, 2013 (hence the title \"TM 13\"), Cave created a powerful sculpture centering on a hoodie, denim pants, a Black mannequin, and sneakers. The sculpture is conspicuously covered in a net, \"creat[ing] a kind of Soundsuit for the ghost of Trayvon Martin. A way for a dead black teenager to make an outcry and an uproar, to protest against his undeserved demise\".\\nCave\\'s mixed-media sculptures often include black doll or mannequin parts (heads, hands, etc.) placed at the center or top of a piece, creating an altar-like semblance. By focusing his pieces in this manner, viewers of his art can \"examine the history of trauma and racism, ... the objectification of the black male\". His 2014 exhibition Rescue \"inspects the idea of servitude and the accompanying stigma within the Black community\". Most of these works are not audible, like his 2016–2017 exhibition Until at MASS MoCa, as Cave wants the exhibition participants \"to be included – and implicated – in the work\" as opposed to focusing on sound and movement. The act of viewing his works with participants seeing one another at the same time is a metaconcept Cave promotes.\\n\\n\\n== Teaching career ==\\n\\nCave has taught extensively at universities across the United States. He began working at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1989 as a professor in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies and was later appointed to the Department of Fashion. As of 2018, he served as the graduate director of the fashion program and chair of the department. He has served as a visiting instructor and artist at a number of other institutions, among them Beloit College, Fabric Workshop & Museum, McColl Center for Art + Innovation, Pilchuck Glass School, University of Arizona, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nCave has participated in numerous solo exhibitions and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally. His solo shows include New Work (1997), Grand Arts, Kansas City, Missouri; Nick Cave: A Quarter Til Ten (2006-2007), Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh; Nick Cave: Meet Me at the Center of the Earth (2009-2012), originating at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco; Until (2016-2021), originating at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams; and Nick Cave: Truth Be Told (2020-2021), originating at Jack Shainman Gallery, New York. His first museum retrospective, Nick Cave: Forothermore, opened in 2022 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, and later travelled to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\\nHe has also participated in a number of group exhibitions, including the 51st Venice Biennale (2005) and the NGV Triennial (2017-2018).\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nCave\\'s work has been met with positive reception. Fellow namesake Nick Cave, an Australian rock musician of the band Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, has spoken positively of the former\\'s work, stating that he has \"admired the work of the American artist [...] for many years\", and drawing attention to its merits as \"an attempt to transmute suffering into a kind of knowing and shielding joy\".\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nCave\\'s husband is fellow designer Bob Faust.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\n\"Soundsuit,\" Baltimore Museum of Art Google Art Project\\n\"At Home and in the Studio with Nick Cave: Home Tour\".

              "  'Ida Applebroog (November 11, 1929 – October 21, 2023) was an American multi-media artist who was best-known for her paintings and sculptures that explore the themes of gender, sexual identity, violence, and politics. Applebroog was the recipient of multiple honors including the MacArthur Fellowship \"Genius Grant\", the College Art Association Distinguished Art Award for Lifetime Achievement, and an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the New School for Social Research/Parsons School of Design. Applebroog lived in New York City and is represented by Hauser & Wirth.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nIda Applebroog was born as Ida Appelbaum on November 11, 1929, in the Bronx, New York, into an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family. From 1948 to 1950, she attended NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences. At the Institute, she studied graphic design rather than fine art. Applebroog stated that she, \"couldn\\'t make art without also making money.\" While studying at NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, she began to work at an advertising agency where she was the only woman. Applebroog later recounted, \"In those days sexual harassment was a day-to-day event. I held out in the ad agency for six months, then resigned.\"\\nAfter resigning from the advertising agency, Applebroog went on to work as a freelance illustrator for children\\'s books and greeting cards. In 1950, she married Gideon Horowitz, her high school sweetheart. She took a job in the art division of the New York Public Library. She also began to take night classes at City College of New York during this time. By 1960, Applebroog had four children and in order for her husband to complete his doctorate, Applebroog and her family had to move to Chicago. After moving to Chicago Applebroog took courses at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and made jewelry in her family\\'s basement that her husband and children would sell at art fairs.\\nIn 1968 Applebroog and her family relocated again to Southern California where her husband accepted an academic position. While living in San Diego, California, Applebroog began sketching close-ups of her own naked body, specifically her crotch, while in the bathtub, a series of more than 150 works she would not exhibit until 2010. In 1969 Applebroog was briefly hospitalized for depression, during which time she began making bathtub sketches. She was released by 1970 and promptly began to continue making art in her studio in San Diego. Once she returned from her hospitalization, she began to create sculptures of \"biomorphic forms made from fabric\" amongst much other art. At the age of forty-four she participated in one of her earliest group exhibitions, entitled Invisible/Visible in 1972 at Long Beach Museum of Art.\\nThe following year Applebroog went to the Feminist Artists Conference at California Institute of the Arts, where she spoke with many women artists and was highly influenced by their enthusiasm toward social activism in art. Applebroog moved back to New York City in 1974. It was there, after changing her name from \"Ida Horowitz\" to \"Ida Applebroog\" (based on her maiden name, Applebaum), where she began to develop her own signature artistic style with a series of cartoonlike figures that merged the comic-strip format with the advertising industry\\'s use of story-boards to explain a concept.\\nStarting in 1977 she circulated a series of self-published books through the mail, and joined Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics, alongside feminist curators and artists such as Lucy R. Lippard and May Stevens, among others. In 1981 she showed Applebroog: Silent Stagings, her first exhibition at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City, where she continued to show for over 20 years. Applebroog stated that the subject of her work is \"how power works--male over female, parents over children, governments over people, doctors over patients.\"\\nIn 2005 she was profiled in the PBS documentary Art 21: Art in the Twenty-first Century. In 2010, Applebroog\\'s works on paper, including her 1969 sketches, were exhibited in a solo show entitled Ida Applebroog: Monalisa at Hauser & Wirth in New York City, and in 2011 at Hauser & Wirth in London. In 2016 Applebroog was the subject of the documentary Call Her Applebroog, directed by her daughter Beth B.\\nIn 2020, Ida Applebroog\\'s work was included in a major group show at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida. My Body, My Rules, presented an investigation about the diverse artistic practices of 23 female-identified artists in the 21st-century. Louise Bourgeois, Carolee Schneemann, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Ana Mendieta, Wanguechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas, and Francesca Woodman, were also among them.\\nIda Applebroog died on October 21, 2023, at the age of 93.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nGalileo Works, 1977, Self Published\\nDyspepsia Works, 1979, Self Published\\nBlue Books, 1981, Self Published\\n\\n\\n=== Images from exhibitions ===\\ndOCUMENTA (13) Images from the exhibition\\n\\n\\n== Select public collections ==\\nThe Corcoran Museum of Art\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\\nMuseum of Modern Art\\nGuggenheim Museum\\nWhitney Museum of Art\\n\\n\\n== Awards and grants ==\\nArtist\\'s Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1980\\nCreative Artists in Public Service Program, New York State Council on the Arts, 1983\\nArtist\\'s Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1985\\nGuggenheim Fellowship, 1990\\nMilton Avery Distinguished Chair, Bard College, 1991–92\\nLifetime Achievement Award, College Art Association, 1995\\nHonorary Doctorate, New School University/Parsons School of Design, 1997\\nMacArthur Foundation Fellowship, 1998\\nWomen\\'s Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award, 2008\\nAnonymous Was A Woman Award, 2009\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nIda Applebroog, \"Ida Applebroog: Monalisa\" (Hardcover) 2010.

              "  \"Diana Thater (born May 14, 1962, in San Francisco) is an American artist, curator, writer, and educator. She has been a pioneering creator of film, video, and installation art since the early 1990s. She lives and works in Los Angeles, California.\\n\\n\\n== Education and career ==\\nThater studied Art History at New York University and earned her BA in 1984.  In 1990 she was awarded an MFA from Art Center College of Design.\\nSince 2000, Thater has been the artist-in-residence for The Dolphin Project, a non-profit organization that protects cetaceans from slaughter, captivity, and abuse.  In 2009, Diana Thater taught art at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nThater's work explores the temporal qualities of video and film while literally expanding it into space.  She is best known for her site-specific installations in which she manipulates architectural space through forced interaction with projected images and tinted light, such as knots + surfaces (2001) and Delphine (1999) in the Kulturkirche St. Stephani (2009) and the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (2010).\\nThater's primary interest lies in exploring the relationship between humans and the natural world and the distinctions between untouched and manipulated nature. Despite nods to structural film, Thater's underlying reference points are closer to panoramic landscape painting. Thater's stated belief is that film and video are not by definition narrative media, and that abstraction can, and does exist in representational moving images.\\n\\n\\n=== Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden ===\\n\\nOne of Thater's earliest works is Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden (1992), a two part video installation exhibited for the first time in 1992. Thater lived for a time at Claude Monet's former home in Giverny, where she filmed videos on her walks in the home's gardens. The piece is composed of footage of those walks, separated into its component reds, greens and blues; Part I of Oo Fifi is an installation of the three color-separated videos projected on a wall not quite aligned with one another, creating a multi-color effect, while Part II shows the three videos aligned, so the video appears nearly perfectly clear and accurately colored. The third component of the work is wall text listing the scientific names of the plants found in the garden at Monet's home, in addition to a pink light installed in the space where the work is shown.\\nThater had recently finished her MFA and was living in Los Angeles when Oo Fifi was first shown in 1992, over the course of two shows. Thater has said that much of the form of early works like this came from necessity; she was unable to afford screens for the work, so she projected the videos onto a wall in the exhibition space and covered the windows with gels.\\n\\n\\n=== Delphine ===\\nDelphine is one of Thater's most well-known works and was exhibited not only within the United States but also in several different locations around the world, including France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The Delphine exhibition consists of the simultaneous projection of multiple footages of underwater and dolphins. The footages are projected on various surfaces, not just the walls, to create an enveloping and engaging space for the viewers. Thater also placed the projectors in a way that the viewer's silhouette created due to the projector light can physically be part of the work and interact with the subjects within her footages. Unlike some films or videos dealing with animals, Thater's Delphine does not include narration. Thater left out narrations and avoided inserting specific narrative because she believes that animals do not live their lives narratively. Thater wanted to show the animals as they are without enforcing human perspective on them.\\n\\n\\n=== Science, Fiction ===\\nExhibited in 2015, Thater's Science, Fiction is a video installation that is divided into two parts. The two parts are placed in separate rooms, but both rooms have blue hue due to the light beams attached on the floor corners. The first part consists of two monitors, facing each other, showcasing footages of planetarium from Griffith Observatory, which is located in Los Angeles. The second part consists of huge box, size of a small room, that has a projection of dung beetles above it and intense yellow light under it. The purpose behind this exhibition was to visually show the recent scientific discovery that dung beetles use starlight during night time to navigate themselves. Through her exhibition, Thater commented on impact of light pollution on wildlife.\\n\\n\\n=== Chernobyl ===\\nFirst exhibited in 2011, Thater's Chernobyl showcases multiple footages recorded in Prypiat in Chernobyl. The exhibition consists of simultaneous display of multiple footages of different locations in Prypiat. The center of the exhibition is the footage of a movie theater and all four sides of the movie theater are projected on the gallery space. Over the projection of the movie theater, the other footages, such as buildings, animals and nature, are projected as well. This exhibition is not only about showing negative human impact on nature, but to also show how life still persists even under such condition.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince her first solo show in 1991, Thater has staged many exhibitions in museums and galleries in the United States and internationally. Her notable solo shows include Stan Douglas and Diana Thater (1994), Kunstinstituut Melly, Rotterdam, Netherlands; China (1995), Renaissance Society, Chicago; electric mind (1996), Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg, Austria; Selected Works 1992–1996 (1996), Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Orchids in the Land of Technology (1997), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; The best animals are the flat animals (1998), MAK Center for Art and Architecture, Los Angeles; Projects 64: Diana Thater (1998), Museum of Modern Art, New York; Knots + Surfaces (2001-2003), Dia Chelsea, New York; gorillagorillagorilla (2009), Kunsthaus Graz, Austria; Between Science and Magic (2010), Santa Monica Museum of Art (former; now Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles); and Chernobyl (2011-2012), Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia.\\nHer numerous group exhibitions include the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1997, 2006) and the Carnegie International (1999).\\nThe artist is represented by David Zwirner, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nIn 2011, Thater received an Award for Artistic Innovation from the Center for Cultural Innovation in Los Angeles. She used the grant to complete Chernobyl, a large-scale installation project which documents the post-human landscape at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site in the Ukraine, marking the 25th anniversary of the explosion in 2011. She has been the recipient of other notable awards, including the Phelan Award in Film and Video (2006), a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2005), an Étant-donnés Foundation Grant (1996), and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1993).\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDiana Thater.

              "  'John Angus Chamberlain (April 16, 1927 – December 21, 2011), was an American sculptor and filmmaker. At the time of his death he resided and worked on Shelter Island, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nBorn in Rochester, Indiana as the son of a saloonkeeper, Chamberlain was raised mostly by his grandmother after his parents divorced. He spent much of his youth in Chicago. After serving in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1946, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago (1951–52) and Black Mountain College (1955–56). At Black Mountain, he studied with the poets Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan, who were teaching there that semester. The following year, he moved to New York, where for the first time he created sculpture that included scrap-metal auto parts. Over the course of his prolific career, he had studios in New York, New Mexico, Florida, Connecticut, and finally Shelter Island.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nChamberlain is best known for creating sculptures from old automobiles (or parts of) that bring the Abstract Expressionist style of painting into three dimensions. He began by carving and modelling, but turned to working in metal in 1952 and welding 1953. By 1957, while staying with the painter Larry Rivers in Southampton, New York, he began to include scrap metal from cars with his sculpture Shortstop, and from 1959 onward he concentrated on sculpture built entirely of crushed automobile parts welded together. Far more than just another wrinkle on assemblage Shortstop and subsequent works completely reinvented modeling, casting, and volume, altering Marcel Duchamp\\'s notion of the readymade and using the car as both medium and tool. In 1962 Donald Judd wrote, \"The only reason Chamberlain is not the best American sculptor under forty is the incommensurability of \\'the best\\' which makes it arbitrary to say so.\"\\nBy the end of the 1960s, Chamberlain had replaced his signature materials initially with galvanized steel, then with mineral-coated Plexiglas, and finally with aluminum foil. In 1966, he began a series of sculptures made of rolled, folded, and tied urethane foam including sofas. After returning in the mid-1970s to metal as his primary material, Chamberlain limited himself to specific parts of the automobile (fenders, bumpers, or the chassis, for example). In 1973, two 300-pound metal pieces by Chamberlain were mistaken for junk and carted away as they sat outside a gallery warehouse in Chicago.\\nIn the early 1980s, Chamberlain moved to Sarasota, Florida, where an 18,000-square-foot warehouse studio on Cocoanut Avenue enabled him to work on a much grander scale than he previously had. Many of the subsequent works Chamberlain made in Florida revert to more volumetric, compact configurations, often aligned on a vertical axis. As seen in the so-called Giraffe series (circa 1982–83), for example, linear patterns cavort over multicolored surfaces—the results of sandblasting the metal, removing the paint, and exposing the raw surface beneath. In 1984, Chamberlain created the monumental American Tableau created for display on the Seagram Building\\'s plaza.\\nAssembling intricately cut, painted metal parts, Chamberlain made his first mask, A Good Head and a Half (1991), for a benefit auction for Victim Services in 1991, providing aid to victims of sexual assault. He continued to produce masks throughout the 1990s in his studio on Shelter Island, titling many of them with opus numbers.\\nChamberlain also made abstract colour paintings from 1963, and from 1967 he made several films, such as \"Wide Point\" (1968), and \"The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez\" (1968), filmed in Mexico with Warhol regulars Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet. He also made the film \"Black Cherry No-Cal\" (1971), a short black and white experimental film about a man and a woman that meet in Central Park on a bench. In the last decade of his life, the artist expanded his work to large-format photographs.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nChamberlain\\'s first major solo show was held at the Martha Jackson Gallery, New York, in 1960. His singular method of putting discarded automobile-body parts together led to his inclusion in the paradigmatic exhibition \"The Art of Assemblage\", at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961, where his work was shown alongside modern masters such as Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso. His works have since been exhibited around the world and have been included in the São Paulo Art Biennial (1961, 1994), the Whitney Biennial (1973, 1987) and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1982) and he has had over 100 solo shows, including Dia Art Foundation (1983); Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden and Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (1991); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1996); and Menil Collection, Houston (2009). Chamberlain represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1964. He had his first retrospective in 1971, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. A second retrospective was organized in 1986 by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. From February 24 to May 13, 2012, shortly after the artist\\'s death, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum showcased \"John Chamberlain: Choices\", a comprehensive exhibition of the artist\\'s work. The exhibition examined the artist\\'s development over his sixty-year career, exploring the shifts in scale, materials, and techniques informed by the assemblage process that was central to his working method.\\n\\nA special exhibition of Chamberlain\\'s foam sculptures and photographs was on view at the Chinati Foundation in 2005–06. Chamberlain supposedly has a work of art on the moon in the Moon Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nCentre Pompidou, Paris\\nChinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas\\nDia:Beacon, Beacon\\nGalleria Nazionale d\\'Arte Moderna, Rome\\nHyde Collection, Glens Falls, NY\\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.\\nKunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland;\\nMenil Collection, Houston\\nMinneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis\\nModerna Museet, Stockholm\\nMuseum Brandhorst, Munich\\nMuseum Ludwig, Cologne\\nMuseum Moderner Kunst, Vienna\\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia\\nNelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City\\nSaint Louis Art Museum, St. Louis, Missouri\\nScottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale, Arizona\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Maurizio Bolognini (born July 27, 1952) is a post-conceptual media artist. His installations are mainly concerned with the aesthetics of machines, and are based on the minimal and abstract activation of technological processes that are beyond the artist\\'s control, at the intersection of generative art, public art and e-democracy.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nMaurizio Bolognini was born in Brescia, Italy. Before working as a media artist, he received degrees in Urban studies and Social science from the University of Birmingham, UK, and the Università Iuav di Venezia. He worked extensively as a researcher in the field of structured communication techniques (such as the real-time Delphi method), and electronic democracy, which he later used in some interactive installations.  His research interests and a wide range of artworks have focused on three main dimensions of digital technologies:\\n\\n— the possibility of delegating his artistic action to the infinite time of the machine, such as in his Programmed Machines. From the beginning (1988), this series introduced the concept of infinity into his work, and focused on \"the experience of the disproportion (and disjunction) between artist and the artwork, which is made possible by computer-based technologies\";\\n— the space-time flows of technological communication, and the interplay of geographical and electronic space, which gave rise to works such as Altavista (1996), Antipodes (1998), and Museophagia (1998–99), in which the use of web-based communication flows focused on their physical infrastructure and was often combined with actions taken over long distance travels;\\n— the introduction of new forms of interactivity based upon structured communication techniques and e-democracy, which he used in works such as the CIMs (Collective Intelligence Machines, since 2000) and ICB (Interactive Collective Blue, 2006).\\nSome of these works were developed through intense cooperation with Artmedia, the Laboratory of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication, University of Salerno, and the Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art (MLAC), Sapienza University of Rome. In 2003 the MLAC published a monograph book on Bolognini\\'s work. In 2004 Artmedia organized a show which was aimed to highlight a European tendency in new media art, based on the concept of the technological sublime. The show included works by Roy Ascott (English), Maurizio Bolognini (Italian), Fred Forest (French), Richard Kriesche (Austrian) and Mit Mitropoulos (Greek).\\n\\n\\n== Programmed Machines / Sealed Computers ==\\n\\nIn 1988, Bolognini began using personal computers to generate flows of continuously expanding random images. In the 1990s, he programmed hundreds of these computers and left them to run ad infinitum (most of these are still working now). About his Programmed Machines he wrote: \"I do not consider myself an artist who creates certain images, and I am not merely a conceptual artist. I am one whose machines have actually traced more lines than anyone else, covering boundless surfaces. I am not interested in the formal quality of the images produced by my installations but rather in their flow, their limitlessness in space and time, and the possibility of creating parallel universes of information made up of kilometres of images and infinite trajectories. My installations serve to generate out-of-control infinities.\"\\nThe Programmed Machines (and in particular the Sealed Computers, since 1992, whose monitor buses are closed with wax and whose graphic outputs cannot be displayed)  are considered among his most significant works. These Machines were exhibited in many museums and art galleries, in Europe and the United States. In 2003 some sixty Machines were exhibited in three simultaneous shows arranged at the Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art in Rome, the CACTicino Center for Contemporary Art in Switzerland, and the Williamsburg Art & Historical Center in New York. In 2005 the Villa Croce Museum of Contemporary Art, Genoa, dedicated a retrospective and a monograph to these works.\\nSince 2000, Bolognini has concentrated on combining the Programmed Machines with communication devices, as in the Collective Intelligence Machines. These are interactive installations connecting some of his generative machines to the mobile telephone network, to allow a real-time Delphi-like interaction by members of the public. These installations delegate choices to both electronic devices and processes of communication and e-democracy with the aim of involving the audience in new forms of “generative, interactive and public art”.\\nMaurizio Bolognini\\'s work has been considered relevant to the theory of the technological sublime and the aesthetics of flux (as opposed to the aesthetics of form), and has been seen as a further development of conceptual art within neo-technological art.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nConceptual art\\nPost-conceptual\\nGenerative art\\nNew Media Art\\nPublic art\\nSystems art\\nElectronic art\\nInteractive art\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial site for Maurizio Bolognini',\n",
              "  'Pierre Huyghe (born 11 September 1962) is a French contemporary artist, who works in a variety of media from films and sculptures to public interventions and living systems. He lives and works in Paris and New York. \\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nPierre Huyghe (pronounced hweeg) was born in Paris in 1962. He studied at the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs in Paris, and graduated in 1985.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHuyghe participated in the Okayama Summit in 2016, and was the event\\'s artistic director in 2019. In an interview in Ocula Magazine with Stephanie Bailey, Huyghe explained that he chose \\'artists who construct worlds that have the capacity to endlessly change, rather than as makers of things\\' — a quality that translates to his own practice.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nHuyghe has received a number of awards, including the Nasher Prize (2017), Kurt Schwitters Prize (2015); Roswitha Haftmann Award (2013), the Smithsonian Museum’s Contemporary Artist Award (2010), the Hugo Boss Prize from the Guggenheim Museum (2002), and a DAAD in Berlin (1999–2000). In 2024, Huyghe was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix Artistique by the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca.\\n\\n\\n== Work and themes ==\\nHuyghe has been working with time-based situations and site-specific installations since the early 1990s. His works consist of such diverse forms as objects, films, photographs, drawings, music, fictional characters, and full-fledged ecosystems, in effect treating exhibition and its ritual as an object in itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Role playing ===\\nIn Blanche-Neige, (1997), Huyghe revealed the face and story of Lucie Dolène, the French voiceover artist whom Walt Disney hired to do the French language version of Snow White. When Disney subsequently reissued the film and used Dolmen\\'s voice without her permission, she sued the company for the right to own her own voice. Huyghe\\'s film is a simply edited headshot of Dolène recounting her experience in her unmistakable (to French ears) voice. Blanche-Neige was a more pointed followup to Dubbing, (1996), in which Huyghe screens Tobe Hooper\\'s film Poltergeist but focuses his camera on the fifteen actors who have been hired to do the French voiceovers rather than the projection of the film itself, which is only visible to the actors. In 1999, Huyghe and fellow French artist Philippe Parreno turned this idea of the subjective performance of language into the body of a fictional character by purchasing the rights to a manga figure whom they dubbed \"Annlee\". They then invited other artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pierre Joseph, Mélik Ohanian, Joe Scanlan, and Rirkrit Tiravanija to produce various works utilizing the character Annlee, the sum of which became the traveling group exhibition No Ghost Just A Shell. After several exhibitions, they transferred the character\\'s copyright to the Annlee Association—a legal entity owned by Annlee, thus ensuring her simultaneous freedom and death.\\n\\n\\n=== Fiction, memory, and place ===\\nHuyghe\\'s two-channel video The Third Memory (1999), commissioned by The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and later exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, takes as its starting point Sidney Lumet\\'s 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino in the role of the bank robber John Wojtowicz. Huyghe\\'s video reconstructs the set of Lumet\\'s film, but he allows Wojtowicz himself, now a few dozen years older and out of jail, to tell the story of the robbery. Huyghe juxtaposes images from the reconstruction with footage from Dog Day Afternoon, demonstrating that Wojtowicz\\'s memory has been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. Streamside Day Follies (2003) was commissioned by the DIA Art Foundation, New York, and involved the integrated relationship between three locales: a fictionalized community in the Hudson Valley that is launching an equally fictional neighborhood festival; a film verité that captures the proceedings of the fledgling festival; and DIA\\'s former Manhattan exhibition space. The exhibition entailed the regular creation of a fourth space in which the fictional community, the film, and the gallery would converge. Huyghe accomplished this by designing four walls suspended from motorized tracks that were programmed to intermittently organized themselves into a darkened enclosure in which the Streamside Day Follies film would screen. When the film was finished, the walls would disperse. A Journey that Wasn\\'t (2005) was commissioned by the Public Art Fund and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and entailed similar intersections of a fictional place, a film, and live convergence. As a film work, A Journey that Wasn\\'t juxtaposes a sailing expedition from Tierra del Fuego in search of an uncharted island off the coast of Antarctica, with the recording (and re-recording) of its symphonic score at the Wollman ice rink in Central Park. The symphonic score was composed by Joshua Cody and featured guitar soloist Elliott Sharp.\\nThe Host and the Cloud (2010) is a feature-length film that was shot entirely within the dormant building that had housed the National Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions, Paris. The rambling, melancholy, somewhat sci-fi narrative is structured around the celebrations of Halloween, Valentine\\'s Day, and May Day. The film\\'s premier at Marian Goodman Gallery, New York, was accompanied by several of Huyghe\\'s Zoodram sculptures, elaborate aquariums featuring exotic sea creatures that are not unlike the captive human ecosystem depicted in The Host and the Cloud. For dOCUMENTA(13) (2012) Pierre Huyghe created Untilled (2011–2012), a compost site within a baroque garden, a non hierarchical association that included a sculpture of a reclining nude with a head obscured by a swarming beehive, aphrodisiac and psychotropic plants, a dog with a pink leg, and an uprooted oak tree from Joseph Beuys’ 7,000 Oaks, among other elements. Untilled was ranked third in The Guardian\\'s Best Art of the 21st Century list, with critic Adrian Searle calling it a \"wondrous work\" and \"an elegy for a dying world\".\\n\\n\\n=== Anthropomorphism ===\\nHuman Mask (2014) is a film set in post-disaster Fukushima that depicts the listless activity of a trained monkey-servant dressed in the mask of a young woman.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nStech, Fabian (2006).

              "  'Agnes Bernice Martin  (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was an American abstract painter known for her minimalist style and abstract expressionism. Born in Canada, she moved to the United States in 1931, where she pursued higher education and became a U.S. citizen in 1950. Martin\\'s artistic journey began in New York City, where she immersed herself in modern art and developed a deep interest in abstraction. Despite often being labeled a minimalist, she identified more with abstract expressionism. Her work has been defined as an \"essay in discretion, inwardness and silence.\"\\nGrowing up in rural Canada and influenced by the New Mexico desert, Martin\\'s art was characterized by serene compositions featuring grids and lines. Her works were predominantly monochromatic, employing subtle colors like black, white, and brown. Martin\\'s minimalist approach conveyed tranquility and spirituality, and her paintings often carried positive names reflective of her philosophy.\\nHer career included numerous exhibitions, totaling over 85 solo shows, and participation in major events such as the Venice Biennale and Documenta. Martin\\'s work earned recognition for its unique contribution to contemporary art, and she received awards like the National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998. She was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2004.\\nDespite personal struggles with schizophrenia, Martin\\'s dedication to her art persisted, and her legacy continues to inspire contemporary artists. Documentaries and films have explored her life and work, shedding light on her artistic process and impact. Beyond the art world, her influence extends to popular culture, as seen in a Google doodle and a song dedicated to her. Martin\\'s artistic vision, blending minimalism and spirituality, remains an enduring and influential force in the realm of abstract art.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nAgnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in Macklin, Saskatchewan, one of four children. From 1919, she grew up in Vancouver.:\\u200a237\\u200a She moved to the United States in 1931 to help her pregnant sister, Maribel, in Bellingham, Washington.:29 She preferred American higher education and became an American citizen in 1950. Martin studied at Western Washington University College of Education, Bellingham, Washington, prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from Teachers College, Columbia University. It was while living in New York that Martin became interested in modern art and was exposed to artists such as Arshile Gorky (1904–1948), Adolph Gottlieb (1903–1974), and Joan Miró (1893–1983). She took a multitude of studio classes at Teachers College and began to seriously consider a career as an artist.\\nIn 1947, she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in Taos, New Mexico.:\\u200a237\\u200a After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life. A few years following graduation, Martin matriculated at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, where she also taught art courses before returning to Columbia University to earn her M.A. (1952) in modern art. She moved to New York City in 1957 and lived in a loft in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan.:\\u200a238\\u200a The Coenties Slip was also home to several other artists and their studios. There was a strong sense of community although each had their own practices and artistic temperaments. The Coenties Slip was also a haven for the queer community in the 1960s. It is speculated that Martin was romantically involved with the artist Lenore Tawney (1907–2007) during this time. A pioneer of her time, Agnes Martin never publicly expressed her sexuality, but has been described as a \"closeted homosexual.\" The 2018 biography Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon describes several romantic relationships between Martin and other women, including the dealer Betty Parsons. She often employed a feminist lens when she critiqued fellow artists\\' work. Jaleh Mansoor, an art historian, stated that Martin was \"too engaged in a feminist relation to practice, perhaps, to objectify and label it as such.\" It is worth noting that Martin herself did not identify as a feminist and even once told a New Yorker journalist in an interview that she thought \"the women\\'s movement had failed.\"\\nMartin was publicly known to have schizophrenia, although it was undocumented until 1962. She even once opted for electric shock therapy for treatment at Bellevue Hospital in New York. Martin did have the support of her friends from the Coenties Slip, who came together after one of her episodes to enlist the help of a respected psychiatrist, who as an art collector was a friend to the community. However, her struggle was a largely private and individual one, and the full effect of the mental illness on her life is unknown.\\nMartin left New York City abruptly in 1967, disappearing from the art world to live alone. After eighteen months on the road camping across both Canada and the western United States, Martin settled in Mesa Portales, near Cuba, New Mexico (1968-1977). She rented a 50-acre property and lived a simple life in an adobe home that she built for herself, adding four other buildings over the years. During these years she did not paint, until 1971, when she was approached by curator Douglas Crimp who was interested in organizing her first solo non-commercial exhibition. Subsequently, Martin started to write and lecture at various universities about her work. Slowly Martin\\'s interest in painting renewed as well. She approached Pace Gallery about her work and the gallery\\'s founder Arne Glimcher (b.1938) became her lifelong dealer. Finally able to own her own property, she moved to Galisteo, New Mexico, where she lived until 1993.:\\u200a240\\u200a She built an adobe home there too, still choosing an austere lifestyle. Although she still preferred solitude and lived alone, Martin was more active in the art world, travelling extensively and showing in Canada, the United States, and internationally. In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in Taos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in 2004.:\\u200a242\\u200a\\nMany of her paintings bear positive names such as Happy Holiday (1999) and I Love the Whole World (2000). In an interview in 1989, discussing her life and her painting, Agnes Martin said, \"Beauty and perfection are the same. They never occur without happiness.\"\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nHer work is most closely associated with Taos, with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert environment of New Mexico. However, there is also a strong influence from her young upbringing in rural Canada, particularly the vast and quiet Saskatchewan prairies. While she described herself as an American painter, she never forgot her Canadian roots, returning there after she left New York in 1967, as well as during her extensive travels in the 1970s. Some of Martin\\'s early works have been described as simplified farmer\\'s fields, and Martin herself left her work open to interpretation encouraging comparisons of her unembellished, monochromatic canvases to landscapes.\\nShe moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, and Lenore Tawney. Barnett Newman actively promoted Martin\\'s work, and helped install Martin\\'s exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late 1950s. Another close friend and mentor was Ad Reinhardt. In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend Lenore Tawney\\'s first solo exhibition, the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist. In 1967, Martin famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt, the demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist Chryssa whom Martin had dated off and on throughout the 1960s. In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalized to control symptoms of schizophrenia which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia: on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan\\'s Bellevue Hospital. After Martin left New York, she drove around the western US and Canada, settling in Cuba, New Mexico for a few years (1968-1977), then settling in Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993).:\\u200a240–242\\u200a In both New Mexico homes, she built adobe brick structures herself. She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events that brought other artists into the public eye. She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a log cabin she would use as her studio. That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from 1975 they were exhibited regularly.\\nIn 1976 she made her first film, Gabriel, a 78-minute landscape film which features a little boy going for a walk. A second movie, Captivity, was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town dump.\\nAccording to a filmed interview with her that was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building\\'s imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years. Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The Drawing Center (traveling to other museums as well) in 2005 – 3x abstraction – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin\\'s work. The 2018 biography Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon was the first book to explore Martin\\'s relationship with women and her early life in substantial detail and was written in collaboration with Martin\\'s family and friends.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic style ==\\nIn addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin\\'s early works included biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and 1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her first steps into abstraction.\\nMartin praised Mark Rothko for having \"reached zero so that nothing could stand in the way of truth\". Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality. Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early 1960s, she created 6 × 6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids. In the 1966 exhibition Systemic Painting at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Martin\\'s grids were therefore celebrated as examples of Minimalist art and were hung among works by artists including Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, and Donald Judd. While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the artist\\'s hand; she shied away from intellectualism, favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially Taoist. Because of her work\\'s added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she preferred to be classified as an abstract expressionist.\\nMartin worked in only black, white, and brown before moving to New Mexico. The last painting before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, Trumpet, marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint. In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, On a Clear Day. During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light. Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72 × 72 square paintings to 60 × 60 inches and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color. Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In Untitled No. 4 (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic paint blended with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist. In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.\\nLawrence Alloway noted that Martin is in the first generation of the Abstract Expressionism style, which is significant and \"shows her commitment to exalted subject matter\" and her ability to \"transform it into the language of painting which gives the works their aura of silent dignity.\"\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin\\'s work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and two retrospectives including the survey, Agnes Martin, organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1974–1990 organized by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the Menil Collection, Houston, mounted Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond. That same year, the Harwood Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico, Pandora, organized Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001, as well as a symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.\\nIn addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale (1997, 1980, 1976), the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1977), and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women\\'s Caucus for Art of the College Art Association (2005); Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992); the Governor\\'s Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor Gary Johnson, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the National Medal of Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton and the National Endowment for the Arts (1998); the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement by the College Art Association (1998); the Golden Lion for Contribution to Contemporary Art at the Venice Biennale (1997); the Oskar Kokoschka Prize awarded by the Austrian government (1992); the Alexej von Jawlensky Prize awarded by the city of Wiesbaden, Germany (1991); and election to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York (1989).\\nExhibitions continue to be mounted since her death in 2004, including Agnes Martin: Closing the Circle, Early and Late Feb 10, 2006 – Mar 04, 2006 at Pace Gallery. Other exhibitions have been held in New York, Zurich, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cambridge (England), Aspen, Albuquerque, British Columbia in Canada. In 2012, The Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, University of New Mexico launched a museum wide exhibition titled, Agnes Martin Before the Grid in honor of her centennial year. This exhibit was the first to focus on the work and life of Martin prior to 1960. The exhibit focused on many, never seen before, works Martin created at Columbia, Coentis Slip and early years in New Mexico. It was also the first to consider Martins struggle with mental health, sexuality and Martin\\'s important relationship with Ad Reinhardt. In 2015, Tate Modern ran a retrospective of her life and career from the 1950s until her last work in 2004, which will travel to other museums after the show in London. At the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Martin was featured in the exhibition Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014 which examined the two generations of Minimalist art side by side, from October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included Anne Truitt, Mary Corse, and contemporary artists Shirazeh Houshiary and Tomma Abts.\\nShe was also featured in White on the White: Color, Scene, and Space in Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. From October 2015 through April 2016, Martin was exhibited in Opening the Box: Unpacking Minimalism at The George Economou Collection in Athens, Greece alongside Dan Flavin and Donald Judd.  From 2015 to 2017 she had numerous solo exhibitions, some being at the Aspen Art Museum in Aspen Colorado, Tate Modern in London, K20, Kunstsammlung Nordhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in the Upper East Side, at the Palace of Governors, The New Mexico Museum of History in Santa Fe. She has featured in the ongoing exhibition Intuitive Progression at the Fisher Landau Center for Art in Long Island City, New York from February 2017 to August 2017.\\nIn 2016, a retrospective exhibition of her works from the 1950s through 2004 was presented at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2016 she was also featured in the Dansaekhwa and Minimalism Exhibition at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles and earlier in the year in the show titled Aspects of Minimalism: Selections from East End Collections at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York.\\nShe was also featured in Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction at The Museum of Modern Art in Midtown, New York which shined a light on women artists who worked post World War II and before the start of the Feminist movement. The exhibition went from April 2017 to August 2017 and featured Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, and Joan Mitchell, Lygia Clark, Gego, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Eva Hesse.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMartin\\'s work can be found in major public collections in the United States, including the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, NM; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; The Chinati Foundation, Marfa, TX; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art; The Menil Collection, Houston, TX; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines, IA, among others. Her work is on \"long-term view\" and part of the permanent holdings of Dia Art Foundation, Beacon, New York.\\nInternational holdings of Martin\\'s work include the Tate, London and Magasin 3 Stockholm Konsthall, Stockholm, Sweden.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2007, Martin\\'s Loving Love (2000) was sold for $2.95 million at Christie\\'s, New York. In 2015, Untitled #7 (1984), a white acrylic painting with geometric pencil lines, sold for $4.2 million at Phillips in New York. In 2016, her Orange Grove sold at auction for $13.7 million, the same year as the Guggenheim held a retrospective of her work.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nMartin became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher.\\nHer image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.\\nIn 1994, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, part of the University of New Mexico, announced that it would renovate its Pueblo-revival building and dedicate one wing to Martin\\'s work. The gallery was designed according to the artist\\'s wishes in order to accommodate Martin\\'s gift of seven large untitled paintings made between 1993 and 1994. An Albuquerque architectural firm, Kells & Craig, designed the octagonal gallery with an oculus installed overhead, and four yellow Donald Judd benches placed directly under the oculus. The gift of the paintings and gallery\\'s design and construction were negotiated and overseen by Robert M. Ellis, the Harwood\\'s director at the time and a close friend of Martin\\'s. Today, the Agnes Martin Gallery attracts visitors from all over the world and has been compared by scholars to the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence (Matisse Chapel), Corbusier\\'s Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, and the Rothko Chapel in Houston. \\n\\n\\n=== Films about Martin ===\\n2000: Thomas Luechinger: On a Clear Day – Agnes Martin.

Who would disagree with her?... No-one who has seriously spent time before an Agnes Martin, letting its peace communicate itself, receiving its inexplicable and ineffable happiness, has ever been disappointed. The work awes, not just with its delicacy, but with its vigor, and this power and visual interest is something that has to be experienced.\"\\nPoet Hugh Behm-Steinberg\\'s poem \"Gridding, after some sentences by Agnes Martin\" discusses patterns in the natural world, makes a parallel between writing and painting, and ends with a line about the poet\\'s admiration of Martin\\'s work.\\nHer work inspired a Google doodle on the 102nd anniversary of her birth on March 22, 2014. The doodle takes color cues from Agnes Martin\\'s late work which is marked by soft edges, muted colors and distinctly horizontal bands, turned to six vertical bars, one for each letter of the Google logo.\\nThe song \"Agnes Martin\" by American rock band Screaming Females, from their album All at Once, is an ode to the artist.\\nPoet Victoria Chang\\'s work With My Back to the World (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2024) is in conversation with both Martin\\'s artwork and writings.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nMartin, Agnes (1991).

              "  'Bastiaan Johan Christiaan \"Bas Jan\" Ader (19 April 1942 – disappeared 1975) was a Dutch conceptual and performance artist, and photographer. His work was in many instances presented as photographs and film of his performances. He made performative installations, including Please Don\\'t Leave Me (1969).\\nAder was lost at sea in 1975, attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the American coast to England sailing in a thirteen-foot sailboat. His deserted vessel was found off the coast of Ireland on 18 April  1976, offering few clues as to his fate.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn on 19 April 1942, Ader grew up in Drieborg, a small village in the Dutch province of Groningen. His parents were both Calvinist ministers. His father was executed in 1944 by the Nazis for his large scale endeavors to help Jewish compatriots to escape the Holocaust.\\nDuring adolescence, Ader took art classes at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and later in the United States during a study abroad program. Ader graduated from the Otis College of Art and Design in 1965 with a BFA, and from the Claremont Graduate University in 1967. After graduating, he taught at various institutions, including Mt. San Antonio College, Immaculate Heart College, and the University of California, Irvine.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nAder created a handful of photographs as well as several short black-and-white films in which he is the sole performer.\\nOne of his most famous works, I\\'m too sad to tell you, consists of a 3-minute silent black-and-white movie of him crying, several photographs (long hair and short hair versions) and a post card mailed to his friends with the inscription \"I\\'m too sad to tell you\". Other films include him sitting on a chair on a pitched roof until he falls, one where he is hanging on a branch until his grip gives out and he falls into a stream, and a film in which he rides his bike into a canal.\\nIn 1969–70 he anonymously published the satirical conceptual art magazine Landslide with his friend William Leavitt.  The magazine featured \"interviews\" with nonexistent artists, such as \"Brian Shitart\", and pranks such as \"expandable sculpture\" which was five packing peanuts in an envelope. Although satirical of conceptual art, the magazine itself is considered a work of conceptual art.\\nIn 1973 he made the work \\'In search of the miraculous (One night in Los Angeles)\\', a series of photographs showing a lonely figure wandering through the night in L.A, searching everywhere with a flashlight. It was the first part of a triptych. The second part would be the record of his Atlantic crossing (see below), the third part a similar night time search somewhere in the Netherlands, again to be recorded in a series of photographs.\\nHe had arranged for a choir to sing sea shanties at a gallery in Los Angeles before his departure from Cape Cod. A similar performance was planned upon his arrival in a museum in Groningen, Netherlands.\\nDue to his loss at sea, the triptych was never completed. The title \"In Search of the Miraculous\" was a reference to P.D. Ouspensky\\'s mystical book In Search of the Miraculous.\\n\\n\\n== Disappearance ==\\nOn 9 July 1975, Ader set off from Cape Cod and the U.S. state of Massachusetts in a 13 ft (4.0 m) modified \"Guppy 13\" pocket cruiser named Ocean Wave, to make his single-handed west–east crossing of the North Atlantic. He estimated that the voyage should take him some two and a half months. His unmanned boat was found on 18 April 1976, nine months after he had set sail, floating nearly vertically in the water, bow down, 200 nautical miles (360 km) due west of Land\\'s End, 100 nautical miles SW of Ireland. Ocean Wave was found by Spanish fishermen who took her to A Coruña from where she was stolen somewhere between 18 May and 7 June 1976.\\nHow Ader may have met his death is the source of much speculation. Sightings of him and his boat off the American East Coast and the Azores are unconfirmed. Ader was an accomplished sailor, having been one of a two-handed crew, sailing a yacht from Morocco to California in 1962–63. His brother Erik, an experienced ocean sailor, thinks that the fixed point on the boat to which his life line was attached was ripped out when he fell overboard in heavy weather. His conclusion is based on interviews with people in Spain who saw his retrieved boat before it was stolen.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions, reception and impact ==\\nIn 1961, Ader exhibited his works at three galleries in Washington DC and received a positive review in The Washington Post. He became a minor sensation, being interviewed by The Voice of America and by the press in his native Holland. In 1967, he gained his Master of Fine Arts with his project Implosion at Claremont Graduate School.\\nDuring his lifetime, Ader had solo exhibitions at the Chouinard Art School, Los Angeles (1970), the Pomona College Museum of Art (1972), and the galleries Art & Project, Amsterdam (1972), Kabinett für Aktuelle Kunst, Bremerhaven, Germany (1972, 1974) and the Claire S.

              "  \"Alexander Ney (Russian: Александр Ней; born September 1939 in Leningrad, Soviet Union) is an American sculptor and painter. After establishing himself in 1972 as a resident of France, he immigrated to the United States in 1974 and has since lived and worked in New York City. Developing several individualistic styles in modern art, he is most famous for his unique work in terra cotta sculpture, involving heavily perforated surfaces and intriguing forms.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBorn at the outbreak of World War II, Ney's early childhood was entrenched in difficulty. Two weeks before Ney became 2 years old, the Siege of Leningrad was launched, described by historians as the second most lethal battle in the war's tragic history. The pivotal city’s rail connections were severed, cutting off all access to any food and power supplies. In the following winters that ensued, between two and three million civilians—including 400,000 children—died during the Leningrad Blockade.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nAfter being given private art lessons at the home of influential Russian sculptor V.V. Lishev (1877–1960), from 1954 to 1957 Ney studied at the Art School of the Leningrad Academy of Arts, and later at the Art School of the Surikov Moscow Art Institute from 1957 to 1959. Ney befriended a wide number of progressive-minded art students, now stars of the contemporary Russian art scene such as Alexander Kosolapov, Leonid Sokov, Alexander Yulikov, Lev Nussberg and Vadim Kosmatschof. His relentless efforts in creating strikingly new interpretations of art quickly made the young artist legendary amidst his peers. Artists Alexander Kosolapov and Igor Makarevich, amongst others, recall that Ney played an influential role in their early years.\\nFrom 1965 to 1967, Ney taught sculpture to children at the House of Young Pioneers in Leningrad. Students included future Russian novelist Sergei Dovlatov (1941–1990).\\nIn 1967 through 1969, Ney attended art history and theory courses at the Ilya Repin Institute. He continued to perfect his skills as both a painter and sculptor, as well as an art theoretician.\\nDue to his highly productive creative output's clashing with the Soviet mandates of Socialist Realism, Ney absconded to France in 1972 on a tourist visa, as immigration was not permitted. His was granted residencies and established studios in the famed art colonies of both Cité internationale des arts in Paris and Villa Arson in Nice.  In 1974, at the encouragement of American Abstract Expressionist painter Elaine de Kooning (wife of Willem), he immigrated with his family to the United States.\\nOne of the first of several noted cultural figures whose early departure inadvertently signaled the start of a new wave of American immigrants from the Soviet Union, the legendary late American designer Gene Moore discovered Ney's work at a chance meeting at The Russian Tea Room. As the longtime Vice President of the flagship landmark location of Tiffany & Co. on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, having displayed the works of contemporary artists Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol, Moore created displays featuring Ney's works annually since 1978 for over thirty years.\\nOn May 29, 1997, a 4-alarm rooftop fire apparently caused by a neighboring commercial building descended into Ney's two-floor home and studio located in Manhattan's Diamond District, destroying thousands of artwork.\\nIn 2009, the National Centre for Contemporary Arts (NCCA) in Moscow held a special anniversary exhibition to honor the artist's 70th anniversary. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg wrote in the accompanying publication's introductory forward:\\n″Throughout his career, Mr. Ney has made an indelible impact on the creative life of our City and beyond—building a diverse and unique range of work that has inspired and moved individuals from around the world. What’s more, Mr. Ney’s success demonstrates the boundless potential of the New York immigrant experience, and his hard work and perseverance set a wonderful example for us all. On behalf of the City of New York, I applaud Mr. Ney for his tremendous achievements and invaluable contributions to the cultural life of our City.″\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\nNotable collections of Ney’s sculptures, paintings and drawings are held at:\\n\\nMuseum Beelden aan Zee, containing the largest collection of international sculpture in the Netherlands\\nThe State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia\\nThe State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow, Russia\\nThe State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow, Russia\\nThe Moscow Museum of Modern Art, Moscow, Russia\\nThe National Centre for Contemporary Arts, Moscow, Russia\\nThe ART4.RU Museum of Contemporary Russian Art, Moscow, Russia\\nThe Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, USA\\nThe Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, USA\\nThe Yeshiva University Museum, New York, USA\\nThe Mead Art Museum, Massachusetts, USA\\nThe McMullen Museum of Art, Massachusetts, USA\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe Getty Research Institute page on Alexander Ney (under Soviet Era pseudonym Nezhdanov)\\nSmithsonian American Art Museum/ National Portrait Gallery Library Artist File\\nAlexander Ney at IMDb\\nBLOUINArtInfo Entry on Alexander Ney\\nAlexander Ney in the J.J.

              "  'Jim Dine (born June 16, 1935) is an American artist. Dine\\'s work includes painting, drawing, printmaking (in many forms including lithographs, etchings, gravure, intaglio, woodcuts, letterpress and linocuts), sculpture and photography; his early works encompassed assemblage and happenings, while in recent years his poetry output, both in publications and readings, has increased.\\nDine has been associated with many art movements including Neo-Dada (use of collage and found objects), Abstract Expressionism (the gestural nature of his painting), and Pop Art (affixing everyday objects including tools, rope, articles of clothing and even a bathroom sink) to his canvases, yet he has avoided such classifications. At the core of his art, regardless of the medium of the specific work, lies an intense autobiographical reflection, a relentless exploration and criticism of self through a number of personal motifs including: the heart, the bathrobe, tools, antique sculpture, and the character of Pinocchio (among flora, skulls, birds and figurative self-portraits). Dine\\'s approach is all-encompassing: \"Dine\\'s art has a stream of consciousness quality to its evolution, and is based on all aspects of his life—what he is reading, objects he comes upon in souvenir shops around the world, a serious study of art from every time and place that he understands as being useful to his own practice.\"\\nDine has had more than 300 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1978), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1984–85), Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, Michigan (2011) and Museum Folkwang, Essen (2015–16). His work is in permanent collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate Gallery, London; Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Tokyo; and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut.\\nDine\\'s distinctions include nomination to Academy of Arts and Letters in New York (1980), Commandeur de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003), the British Museum Medal (2015) following his donation of 234 prints to the museum in 2014, membership of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (2017), and Chevalier de l\\'Ordre de la Légion d\\'Honneur (2018).\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nDine\\'s first formal training took the form of night courses at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, in which he enrolled in 1952 at the age of 16, while attending Walnut Hills High School. It was a decision motivated both by his artistic calling and the lack of appropriate training at high school: \"I always knew I was always an artist and even though I tried to conform to high school life in those years, I found it difficult because I wanted to express myself artistically, and the school I went to had no facilities for that.\" In 1954, while still attending evening courses, Dine was inspired by a copy of Paul J. Sachs\\' Modern Prints and Drawings (1954), particularly by the German Expressionist woodcuts it reproduced, including work by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938), Emil Nolde (1867–1956) and Max Beckmann (1884–1950)—\"I was shocked by them\" — and began creating woodcuts in the basement of his maternal grandparents, with whom he was then living.\\nAfter high school Dine enrolled at the University of Cincinnati but was unsatisfied: \"They didn\\'t have an art school, they had a design school. I tried that for half a year. It was ridiculous […] All I wanted to do was paint.\" At the recommendation of a friend majoring in theatre at Ohio University in Athens, Dine enrolled there in 1955, where he recalls being \"blown away\", not by the facilities but because: \"I sensed a bucolic freedom in the foothills of the Appalachians where I could possibly develop and be an artist.\" Under printmaking teacher Donald Roberts (1923–2015) Dine experimented in lithography, etching, intaglio, dry paint and woodcuts. At Roberts\\' suggestion, Dine subsequently studied for six months with Ture Bengtz (1907–73) at the School of Fine Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, before returning to Ohio University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1957 (remaining for an additional year to make paintings and prints, with the permission of the faculty).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nIn 1958 Dine moved to New York, where he taught at the Rhodes School. In the same year he founded the Judson Gallery at the Judson Church in Greenwich Village with Claes Oldenburg and Marcus Ratliff, eventually meeting Allan Kaprow and Bob Whitman: together they became pioneers of happenings and performances, including Dine\\'s The Smiling Workman of 1959. Dine\\'s first exhibition was at the Reuben Gallery, where he also staged the elaborate performance Car Crash (1960), which he describes as \"a cacophony of sounds and words spoken by a great white Venus with animal grunts and howls by me.\" Another important early work was The House (1960), an environment incorporating found objects and street debris, installed at the Judson Gallery.\\nDine continued to include everyday items (including personal possessions) in his work, which linked him to Pop Art—an affinity strengthened by his inclusion in the influential 1962 exhibition \"New Painting of Common Objects\" at the Pasadena Art Museum, curated by Walter Hopps and later cited as the first institutional survey of American Pop Art, including works by Robert Dowd, Joe Goode, Phillip Hefferton, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Ruscha, Wayne Thiebaud and Andy Warhol. Dine has, however, consistently distanced himself from Pop Art: \"I\\'m not a Pop artist. I\\'m not part of the movement because I\\'m too subjective. Pop is concerned with exteriors. I\\'m concerned with interiors. When I use objects, I see them as a vocabulary of feelings. […] What I try to do in my work is explore myself in physical terms—to explain something in terms of my own sensibilities.\"\\n\\n\\n== Motifs ==\\n\\nSince the early 1960s Dine has refined a selection of motifs through which he has explored his self in myriad forms and media, and throughout the different locations/studios in which he has worked, including: London (1968–71); Putnam, Vermont (1971–85); Walla Walla, Washington (since 1983); Paris (since 2001); and Göttingen (since 2007), in a studio adjacent to the premises of Steidl, the printer and publisher of the majority of his books.\\n\\n\\n=== Bathrobes ===\\nDine first depicted bathrobes in 1964 while searching for a new form of self-portraiture at a time when \"it wasn\\'t cool to just make a self-portrait\"; he thus conceived an approach without representing his face. Dine subsequently saw an image of a bathrobe in an advertisement in the New York Times Magazine, and adopted it as a surrogate self-portrait, which he has since depicted in varying degrees of realism and expressionism.\\n\\n\\n=== Hearts ===\\nDine initially expressed this motif in the form of a large heart of stuffed red satin hung above the character of Puck in a 1965–66 production of William Shakespeare\\'s A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream at the Actors\\' Workshop in San Francisco, for which he designed the sets (his original introduction to the motif had been a series of red hearts on white backgrounds he had seen as a student). In time, the heart became for Dine \"a universal symbol that I could put paint onto\" and \"as good a structure geographically as any I could find in nature. It is a kind of landscape and within that landscape I could grow anything, and I think I did.\" The formal simplicity of the heart has made it a subject he could wholly claim as his own, an empty vessel for ongoing experimentation into which to project his changing self. The heart\\'s status as a universal symbol of love further mirrors Dine\\'s commitment to the creative act: \"…what I was in love with was the fact that I was put here to make these hearts—this art. There is a similar sense of love in this method, this act of making art…\"\\n\\n\\n=== Pinocchio ===\\n\"Trying to birth this puppet into life is a great story. It is the story of how you make art\"—Jim Dine. Dine\\'s fascination with the character of Pinocchio, the boy protagonist in Carlo Collodi\\'s The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883), dates to his childhood, when, at the age of six he viewed with his mother Walt Disney\\'s animated film Pinocchio (1940): \"It has haunted my heart forever!\" This formative experience deepened in 1964 when Dine discovered a detailed figure of Pinocchio while purchasing tools: \"It was hand painted, had a paper maché head, beautiful little clothes and articulated limbs. I took it home and I kept it on my shelf for 25 years. I did not do anything with it. I did not know what to do with it, but it was always with me. When I moved houses, I would take it and put it on the bookshelf or put it in a drawer and bring it out, essentially to play with it.\" Yet it was only in the 1990s that Dine represented Pinocchio in his art, first in a diptych; the next Pinocchios were shown at the 1997 Venice Biennale and an exhibition at Richard Gray Gallery, Chicago. Notable depictions since include the 41 color lithographs printed at Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris, in 2006; the book Pinocchio (Steidl, 2006), combining Collodi\\'s text and Dine\\'s illustrations; two monumental bronze sculptures of 9 meters\\' height: Walking to Borås (2008) in Borås, Sweden, and Busan Pinocchio (2013) in Busan, South Korea; and Pinocchio (Emotional) (2012), a twelve-foot bronze at the Cincinnati Art Museum. In recent years Dine\\'s self-identification with the character of Pinocchio has shifted to Gepetto, the gifted woodcarver who crafts the boy puppet.\\n\\n\\n=== Antique sculpture ===\\n\"I have this reverence for the ancient world. I mean Greco-Roman society. This always interested me and the product of it is interesting to me and the literature is interesting—the historic literature. I have this need to connect with the past in my way…\"—Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio, Dine\\'s fascination with antique sculpture dates to early in his life: \"I had always been interested as a child in \\'the antique,\\' because my mother took me to the art museum in Cincinnati, and they had a few beautiful pieces.\"\\nThe antique has thus been present since his early work, for example in Untitled (After Winged Victory) (1959), now held in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, a sculpture inspired by the Winged Victory of Samothrace (ca. 200 B.C.) and composed of a painted robe hung on a found lamp frame and held together with wire, which Dine describes as \"almost like outsider art\" and he first showed at the Ruben Gallery. He most frequently expresses the antique through the figure of the Venus de Milo (ca. 100 B.C.), a small plaster cast of which he bought in Paris; he initially included the cast in 1970s still-life paintings, \"But then I knocked the head off it and made it mine.\" Dine is also inspired by specific sculpture collections, for example that of the Glyptothek in Munich, which he visited in 1984, resulting in the 40 \"Glyptotek Drawings\" [sic] of 1987–88, made in preparation for a series of lithographs. Of the experience Dine recalls: \"The museum director let me come in at night and, therefore, it was a meditation on the pieces I was drawing because I was alone. I felt a link between the ages of history and me and a communication between these anonymous guys who had carved these things centuries before me. It was a way to join hands across the generations, and for me to feel that I did not just grow like a tumbleweed but that I came from somewhere. I belonged to a tradition and it gave me the history I needed.\"\\nAn important recent work that incorporates the antique is Dine\\'s Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets), an installation consisting of 8-foot wooden sculptures inspired by ancient Greek statues of dancing women arranged around a 7-foot self-portrait head of the artist, all installed in a room whose walls he has inscribed with a sprawling poem, \"with its Orphic themes of travel, loss, and the possibilities of art.\" Originally shown in 2008–09 at the Getty Villa, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and echoing the 350–300 B.C. Sculptural Group of a Seated Poet and Sirens (2) with unjoined fragmentary curls (304) held in the Getty collection, Dine has since updated Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets) as a permanent, site-specific installation housed in the purpose-built Jim Dine Pavilion, adjacent to the Kunsthaus Göttingen.\\n\\n\\n=== Tools ===\\n\"I never stopped being enchanted by these objects.\" — Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio and antique sculpture, tools are a motif inextricably linked to Dine\\'s childhood. His introduction to them came through his maternal grandfather, Morris Cohen, who ran The Save Supply Company hardware store in Cincinnati; Dine lived with Cohen for three years as a boy, and had daily contact with him until the age of 19. Dine recalls hammers, saws, drills, screwdrivers among various hardware paraphernalia; later, Dine worked in Cohen\\'s store on Saturdays.\\nDine was thus inaugurated both into the practical functions of tools and their aesthetic possibilities: \"I admired the beautiful enamel on the ceramic toilets and sinks. I admired the way different colors of conduit electric wire was in rolls next to each other, and the way it had been braided. In the paint department, the color charts looked to me like perfect, perfect jewel boxes.\" He recalls the sensual impact of \"very, very beautiful\" pristine white paint: \"I would play with it by sticking one of his screwdrivers in and breaking the skin and moving it around. It was like white taffy. It had a fabulous smell of linseed oil and turpentine.\" Accordingly, he finds them \"as mysterious and interesting an object as any other object. There\\'s no aristocracy here.\"\\nAs a motif that symbolizes raw materials being transformed into art — tools have unique status in Dine\\'s practice as \"artificial extensions of his hands, effectively allowing him to shape and form certain given conditions and objects more systematically,\" and as \"\\'primary objects\\' that create a connection with our human past and the hand.\" In Dine\\'s own words, the tool is fundamentally \"a metaphor for \\'work\\'\".\\nDine has integrated real tools into his art from his earliest works — for example, Big Black Work Wall (1961), a painting with tools attached, and The Wind and Tools (A Glossary of Terms) (2009), three wooden Venus statues wearing girdles belts of tools—as well as depicting them in media including paintings, drawings, photographs and prints. An extraordinary printing series involving tools is A History of Communism (2014), in which Dine printed tool motifs on top of lithographs made from stones found in an art academy in Berlin and showing four decades of students\\' work from the German Democratic Republic. By overlaying his own personal vocabulary of tools, Dine engages with the symbolic tools of communism — the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union, and the hammer and compass, ringed by rye, of the German Democratic Republic — and unsettles the assertion of any certain \"truth\", showing that \"history is never a coherent narrative—although it might be presented as such with an ulterior motive—but rather a fragmented, layered and multi-sited process.\"\\n\\n\\n== Selected teaching positions ==\\n1965 – guest lecturer at Yale University and artist-in-residence, Oberlin College, Ohio\\n1966 – teaching residency at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York\\n1993–95 – Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, Salzburg\\n1995–96 – Hochschule der Künste, Berlin\\n\\n\\n== Selected long-term collaborations ==\\n1962–76: gallerist Ileana Sonnabend, New York\\n1975–2008: printmaker Aldo Crommelynck, Paris\\n1978–2016: Pace Gallery, New York\\n1979–present: gallerist Alan Cristea, London\\n1983–2018: gallerist Richard Gray, Chicago\\n1983–present: Walla Walla Foundry, Walla Walla, Washington\\n1987–2003: printmaker Kurt Zein, Vienna\\n1991–2016: Spring Street Workshop, New York, with printers including Julia D\\'Amario, Ruth Lingen, Katherine Kuehn, Bill Hall\\n1998–present: printer and publisher Gerhard Steidl, Göttingen\\n2000–present: gallerist Daniel Templon, Paris-Brussels\\n2003–18: printmakers Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris\\n2010–present: foundry Blue Mountain Fine Art, Baker City, Oregon\\n2016–present: printmakers Steindruck Chavanne Pechmann, Apetlon\\n2016–21: Gray Gallery, Chicago\\n\\n\\n== Selected permanent collections ==\\n\\nAllen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin\\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago\\nBowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, ME\\nBrooklyn Museum, Brooklyn\\nCincinnati Art Museum, Cincinnati\\nCleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland\\nFogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge\\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.\\nIndianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis\\nIsrael Museum, Jerusalem\\nLouisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humelbeak, Denmark\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis\\nMuseum Folkwang, Essen\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Chicago\\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nPalm Springs Art Museum, CA\\nSnite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Sir Isaac Julien  (born 21 February 1960) is a British installation artist, filmmaker, and Distinguished Professor of the Arts at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJulien was born in the East End of London, one of the five children of his parents, who had migrated to Britain from St Lucia. He graduated in 1985 from Saint Martin\\'s School of Art, where he studied painting and fine art film. He co-founded Sankofa Film and Video Collective in 1983, and was a founding member of Normal Films in 1991.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nIn 1980, Julien organized the Sankofa Film and Video Collective with, among others, Martina Attille, Maureen Blackwood, Nadine Marsh-Edwards, which was \"dedicated to developing an independent black film culture in the areas of production, exhibition and audience\". He received a BA in fine-art film from Central Saint Martins School of Art, London (1984), where he worked alongside artists including Sandra Lahire, Malcolm Le Grice, Lis Rhodes, Vera Neubauer, Adam Finch, and Tina Keane, and completed his postdoctoral studies at Les entrepreneurs de l\\'audiovisuel européen, Brussels (1989).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nJulien achieved prominence in the film world with his 1989 drama-documentary Looking for Langston, gaining a cult following with this poetic exploration of Langston Hughes and the Harlem Renaissance. His following grew when his film Young Soul Rebels won the Semaine de la Critique prize for best film at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991.\\nOne of the objectives of Julien\\'s work is to break down the barriers that exist between different artistic disciplines, drawing from and commenting on film, dance, photography, music, theatre, painting and sculpture, and uniting these to construct a powerfully visual narrative. Thematically, much of his work directly relates to experiences of black and gay identity (he is himself gay), including issues of class, sexuality, and artistic and cultural history.\\nJulien is a documentary filmmaker, and his work in this genre includes BaadAsssss Cinema, a film on the history and influence of blaxploitation cinema.\\nIn 2023, the Tate Gallery in London held a major retrospective of his work titled What Freedom Is to Me. The exhibition was set to open at the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastrict in March 2024.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations ===\\nJulien cites cultural theorist and sociologist Stuart Hall as an important influence on his filmmaking.

              "  'Art & Language is an English conceptual artists\\' collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created around 1967. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art, and included many Americans.\\nFrom May 1969 the group published in England Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe Art & Language group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by Terry Atkinson (b. 1939), David Bainbridge (b. 1941), Michael Baldwin (b. 1945) and Harold Hurrell (b. 1940). The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created gallery art and presented these ideas in a journal as part of their discussions.\\nThe first issue of Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art (Volume 1, Number 1) was published in May, 1969.\\nIn 1972, the group created Index 01, consisting of 350 texts placed inside 8 filing cabinets. These texts were \"indexed according to their logical and ideological (in)compatibility\", to assert a \"critical inquiry into art practice as an art activity in itself\". The Art & Language group that exhibited in the international Documenta 5 exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of Art-Language. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by Art & Language members.\\n\\n\\n== Projects ==\\nIan Burn and Mel Ramsden co-founded The Society for Theoretical Art and Analysis in New York in the late 1960s. They joined Art & Language in 1970–71. During this time, Sarah Charlesworth and Christine Kozlov became affiliated with the group. New York Art & Language became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.\\n\\n \\nIn the early years of the 1970s, several artists joined the collective, including Ian Burn, Michael Corris, Charles Harrison, Preston Heller, Joseph Kosuth, Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith, and David Rushton. During this time the group produced numerous theoretical writings and art works.\\nDuring the mid-1970s the group was in conflict during a time when conceptual art had lost some of its \"critical bearing\" and was being institutionalized. The conflicts among the collective existed within the context of global socio-political turmoil and economic crisis as well as the \"revival of modernism.\"\\nBy the end of the decade, the only members who remained were Baldwin, Harrison and Ramsden, with the occasional participation of Mayo Thompson and the group Red Krayola with whom several recordings were made. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions.\\nIn 1986, Art & Language was nominated for the Turner Prize.\\n\\nArt & Language and the Jackson Pollock Bar collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the \"Art & Language & Luhmann\" symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium included speakers such as Catherine David, who prepared the Documenta X, and Peter Weibel, artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of an Art & Language text produced in playback by the Jackson Pollock Bar. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt.\\nAn archive of papers relating to \"New York Art & Language\" are held at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nIn 1999, Art & Language exhibited at PS1 MoMA in New York, with a major installation entitled The Artist Out of Work. This was a recollection of Art & Language\\'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, art critic Jerry Saltz wrote, \"A quarter century ago, \\'Art & Language\\' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant.\"\\nIn 2002, Beatriz Herráez, writing for Flash Art, described the Art & Language retrospective exhibition, Too Dark to Read, as \"declaration meant to ‘clarify’ the group’s practice\" as a method that is located in \"the discursive quality of its ideational system and never in isolated works.\"\\nAdrian Searle wrote in 2014: \"Art & Language is as much as anything a conversation from which work arises and goes off on its own tangent, referencing itself, dragging Art & Language’s compendious history with it as it goes. Their\\'s is an art that makes and unmakes itself, eats and regurgitates itself.\"\\n\\n\\n== Members and associates ==\\nMembers and associates include Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin, Kathryn Bigelow, Ian Burn, Sarah Charlesworth,Charles Harrison, Michael Corris,Preston Heller, Graham Howard, Harold Hurrell,Joseph Kosuth, Christine Kozlov, Nigel Lendon, Andrew Menard, Philip Pilkington, Neil Powell, Mel Ramsden, David Rushton, Terry Smith, and Mayo Thompson and Red Crayola.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nInterview with Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden about Art & Language (2011) MP3\\nArt & Language: Blurting in A & L online Hypertext version of a complete print work of 1973 by American members of Art & Language, with articles and a discussion forum.\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBailey, Robert.

              "  'Eija-Liisa Ahtila (born 1959 in Hämeenlinna, Finland) is a contemporary visual artist and filmmaker who lives and works in Helsinki.\\nAhtila is most known for her multi-panel cinematic installations. She experiments with narrative storytelling in her films and cinematic installations. In her earlier works, she dealt with the topic of unsettling human dramas at the center of personal relationships, dealing with teenage sexuality, family relationships, mental disintegration, and death. Her later works, however, pursue more profound artistic questions where she investigates the processes of perception and attribution of meaning, at times in the light of larger cultural and existential themes, like colonialism, faith and posthumanism.\\nAhtila has participated in numerous international art exhibitions such as Manifesta (1998), the Venice Biennale (1999 and 2005), documenta 11 (2002), São Paulo Art Biennial (2008) and the Sydney Biennale in 2002 and 2018.\\nAhtila has won several art and film awards, including the inaugural Vincent Award (2000), Artes Mundi (2006), Prince Eugen Medal (2008), and most recently Art Academic in Finland (2009).\\nHer work is held in the collections of the Tate and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is a former professor at the Department of Time and Space-based Art at the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts (Finland).\\n\\n\\n== Artistic career ==\\nWriting in the journal PAJ, Jane Philbrick describes Ahtila\\'s films as \"Smart, emotionally arresting, engaging, affective.\" Philbrick continues, saying, \"A self-described \\'teller of human dramas\\', she approaches narrative equipped with a rigorous arsenal of postmodern strategies ... One of her most potent tools, however, is a two-centuries-old dramatic genre of proven emotional reach and punch, melodrama.\" Although done in a more sophisticated way than conventional melodramas, Ahtila\\'s work likewise exaggerates plots and characters to affect the viewer\\'s emotions, with less appeal to immediate intellectual comprehension.\\nIn 1993, Ahtila created the three mini-films Me/We, Okay, and Gray: Each of these 90-second mini-films was shown separately and as a trilogy, as trailers in cinemas, on television during commercial breaks and in art galleries. Ahtila explores questions of identity and group relations through her use of narrative conventions derived from film, television and advertising. In Me/We the father of a family speaks about his family in a monologue and other players mouth his words. When the father speaks about his family members\\' emotions, their personalities mix together and become inseparable.\\nIn Okay a woman is speaking about violence in man and woman relationship and as she steps across the room like a tiger in a cage, her voice goes up and shows pure violence.\\nIn Gray three women in a lift go down into the water and talk about the atomic explosion and its effects, while words and pictures mix identity crisis and an atomic disaster.\\nIn 2002, Ahtila created a film called The House, for which she performed research that included conducting interviews with people who are afflicted by psychotic mental disorders. The film begins with a woman driving to a secluded house, and as events continue they take on a dreamlike state. The sounds become disorienting and the images begin to combine: the woman can see the car on the walls of the house; she hears boat horns that make no sense. The film is meant to be presented in an exhibit that displays each of the three screens on separate walls, making the viewer feel as if they are actually in the house where the project was filmed.\\nIn 2002 she had a solo show at Tate Modern, and in 2006 her multi-screen video piece The Wind (2006) was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). She has also had solo shows at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the Parasol Unit in London, ACMI in Melbourne and DHC/ART in Montreal.\\nAmong Ahtila\\'s many other works is The Hour of Prayer, first presented in 2005 at the Venice Biennale in Italy. The film is a four-channel video project that shows scenes from a woman\\'s experience surrounding the death of her dog. Bridget Goodbody, writing for Time Out New York, says that it presents \"a nonnarrative cycle of apparently random, but nonetheless consequential scenes.\" Some of those scenes show how, when she was away from her dog, he fell through the ice of a frozen pond, breaking his leg. Another shows the dog brought to a veterinarian for treatment of the injury; a diagnosis of bone cancer is made. After the dog dies, the film presents scenes of the woman moving on with her life, living as an artist in Africa.\\nAnother of her films, which debuted in 2009, is Where is Where?. New York\\'s Museum of Modern Art, which housed the seven-day exhibition, called it, \"a haunting and layered consideration of how history affects our perception of reality.\" In the film, a present-day poet, with the assistance of a figure who is the personification of death, investigates a murder committed fifty years ago. Two young Arab boys had killed their French friend during the Algerian War of Independence. As the poet investigates, images from the past and present begin to mix and collide; at one point the poet discovers the two boys seated in a boat, in the small swimming pool behind his house.\\nIn 2011 Ahtila\\'s exhibition horizontal first showed at the Marian Goodman Gallery. This piece is a 6 projection instillation showing a pine tree. Each projection shows a different part of the tree. Ahtila distorts the pine tree with tilts of the camera and different coloring for each projection.\\nAlthough Ahtila\\'s films do include more than one character, they tend to focus on the internal experience of just one person. Her work seems to be more about studying and understanding an individual\\'s subjective experience, and how the influences around individuals shape who they are and what they do, and shape their unconscious selves. She is greatly interested in the factors that go into the construction of personal identity, and in how fluid that construct can be. Ahtila wants to explore, as she says, \"how the subconscious is inherited in some way,\" citing as an example, \"[the way] in which my mother is physically present in myself and I am present in her.\"\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Installations ===\\nMe/We, Okay, Grey (1993), 3-channel monitor installation with furniture\\nIf 6 was 9 (1995), 3-channel projected installation\\nToday (1996), 3-channel projected installation\\nAnne, Aki and God (1998), 5-monitor & 2-screen installation with furniture\\nConsolation Service (1999), 2-channel projected installation\\nThe Present (2001), 5-channel monitor installation with furniture\\nThe House (2002), 3-channel projected installation\\nThe Wind (2002), 3-channel projected installation\\nSculpture in the Age of Posthumanism (2004), a sculpture which includes the viewer\\nThe Hour of Prayer (2005), 4-channel projected installation\\nFishermen / Études N°1 (2007), single channel projected installation\\nWhere is Where?

              "  'Vija Celmins (pronounced VEE-ya SELL-muns; Latvian: Vija Celmiņa, pronounced TSEL-meen-ya; born October 25, 1938) is a Latvian American visual artist best known for photo-realistic paintings and drawings of natural environments and phenomena such as the ocean, spider webs, star fields, and rocks. Her earlier work included pop sculptures and monochromatic representational paintings. Based in New York City, she has been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions since 1965, and major retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nVija Celmiņa was born on October 25, 1938, in Riga, Latvia. Upon the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, during World War II, her parents fled with her and her older sister Inta to Germany, then under the Nazi regime; after the end of the war, the family lived in a United Nations supported Latvian refugee camp in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-Württemberg. In 1948, the Church World Service relocated the family to the United States, briefly in New York City, then in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sponsored by a local Lutheran church, her father found work as a carpenter, and her mother in a hospital laundry. Vija was ten, and spoke no English, which caused her to focus on drawing, leading her teachers to encourage further creativity and painting.\\nIn 1955, she entered the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, where she has said that for the first time in her life, she did not feel like an outsider. In 1961 she won a Fellowship to attend a Summer session at Yale University, where she met Chuck Close and Brice Marden, who would remain close friends. It was during this time she began to study Italian monotone still life painter Giorgio Morandi, and painted abstract works. In 1962 she graduated from Herron with a BFA, and moved to Venice, Los Angeles, to pursue an MFA at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating in 1965. At UCLA, she enjoyed freedom, being far from her parents, leading to further artistic exploration. In 1978, she was an artist-in-residence, funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art. She lived in Venice until 1980, painting and sculpting, and working as an instructor at the California State University, Los Angeles, the University of California, Irvine and California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia.\\nIn 1981, following an invitation to teach at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, she moved permanently to New York City, wanting to be closer to the artists and art that she liked. She also returned to painting, which she had abandoned for twelve years, working during that time mainly in pencil. She later used woodcuts, and eraser and charcoal. Since that time, she has worked out of a cottage in Sag Harbor, New York, and a studio loft on Crosby Street in Soho, Manhattan. During the 1980s, she also taught at the Cooper Union and the Yale University School of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nWorking in California in the 1960s, Vija Celmins\\' early work, generally in photorealistic painting and pop-inspired sculpture, was representational. She recreated commonplace objects such as TVs, lamps, pencils, erasers and the painted monochrome reproductions of photographs.  A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery. A retrospective of the 1964–1966 work was organized by the Menil Collection in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2010. She has cited Malcolm Morley and Jasper Johns as influences in this period.\\nIn the late 1960s through the 1970s, she abandoned painting, and focused on working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean\\'s or Moon\\'s surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, a master of the pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter\\'s an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.\\nAt the end of this period, from 1976 to 1983, Celmins also returned to sculpture in a way that incorporated her interest in photorealism. She produced a series of bronze cast, acrylic painted stones, exact replicas of individual stones she found along the Rio Grande in Northern New Mexico, with eleven examples held at MoMA. By 1981, she returned to painting, from this point forward working also with woodcuts and printing, and substantially in charcoal with a wide variety of erasers - often exploring negative space, selectively removing darkness from images, and achieving subtle control of grey tones.\\nFrom the early 1980s forward, Celmins focused on the constellations, moon and oceans using these various techniques, a balance between the abstract and photorealism. By 2000, she had begun to produce haunting and distinctive spider webs, again negative images in oil or charcoal, to much critical acclaim, with particular note of her meticulous surface development and luminosity. She has said that all these works are based on photographs, and she imparts substantial effort on the built-up surfaces of the images.  In a 1996 review of her 30-year retrospective at London\\'s Institute of Contemporary Art, The Independent cited her as \"American art\\'s best-kept secret.\"\\nCritics have often noted that Celmins\\' works since the late 1960s - the moon scapes, ocean surfaces, star fields, shells, and spider webs, often share the characteristic of not having a reference point: no horizon, depth of field, edge or landmarks to put them into context. The location, constellation, or scientific name are all unknown - there is no information imparted.\\n\\nFrom 2008, Celmins returned to objects and representative work, with paintings of maps and books, as well as many uses of small graphite tablets - hand held black boards. She also produced series prints of her now well-known waves, spiderwebs, shells and desert floors, many of which were exhibited at the McKee Gallery in June 2010.  She recently released a new series of prints that includes both night sky and waves mezzotints. These prints were exhibited at the Matthew Marks Gallery in January, February, and March 2018 and the Senior & Shopmaker Gallery in February and March 2018.\\nHer woodcuts of water can take a year to cut; she has commented that they \"remind us of \\'the complexity of the simplest things\\'\".\\n\\n\\n== Solo exhibitions ==\\nCelmins\\'s works have been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions around the world since 1966 (Los Angeles), hundreds of group exhibitions. After her longtime dealer, McKee Gallery in New York, announced its closing in 2015, Celmins is currently represented by Matthew Marks Gallery.\\nIn 2020, the major career survey Vija Celmins, was organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York and exhibited at the institution\\'s former space MET Brauer. Between 1992 and 1994, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, organized the artist\\'s mid-career retrospective. The show traveled to the Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Group exhibitions ==\\nIn 2022, the Hammer Museum at University of California, Los Angeles, organized the exhibition Joan Didion: What She Means, curated by The New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als. The show traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2023, and works by Vija Celmins were included alongside artworks by 50 other contemporary artists such as Félix González-Torres, Ana Mendieta, Betye Saar, Maren Hassinger, Silke Otto-Knapp, John Koch, Ed Ruscha, Pat Steir, among others.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\nIn 2005, a major collector of her work, real estate developer Edward R. Broida, donated 17 pieces, covering 40 years of her career, to the Museum of Modern Art, as part of an overall contribution valued at $50 million ($50,000,000).

              "  'Helen Frankenthaler (December 12, 1928 – December 27, 2011) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing new work. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary museums and galleries in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 Post-Painterly Abstraction exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as color field. Born in Manhattan, she was influenced by Greenberg, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock\\'s paintings. Her work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s. In 2001, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.\\nFrankenthaler had a home and studio in Darien, Connecticut.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nHelen Frankenthaler was born on December 12, 1928, in New York City. Her father was Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court judge. Her mother, Martha (Lowenstein), had emigrated with her family from Germany to the United States as an infant. Helen\\'s two sisters, Marjorie and Gloria, were six and five years older, respectively. Growing up on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side, Frankenthaler absorbed the privileged background of a cultured and progressive Jewish intellectual family that encouraged all three daughters to prepare themselves for professional careers. Her nephew is the artist/photographer Clifford Ross.\\nFrankenthaler studied at the Dalton School under muralist Rufino Tamayo and also at Bennington College in Vermont. While at Bennington, Frankenthaler studied under the direction of Paul Feeley, who is credited with helping her understand pictorial composition, as well as influencing her early cubist-derived style. Upon her graduation in 1949, she studied privately with Australian-born painter Wallace Harrison, and with Hans Hofmann in 1950. She met Clement Greenberg in 1950 and had a five-year relationship with him. She married the painter Robert Motherwell in 1958; the couple divorced in 1971. Both born of wealthy parents, they were known as \"the golden couple\" and for their lavish entertaining. She gained two stepdaughters from him, Jeannie Motherwell and Lise Motherwell. Jeannie Motherwell studied painting at Bard College and the Art Students League in New York and had several exhibits.\\nIn 1994, Frankenthaler married Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., an investment banker who served the Gerald Ford administration.\\n\\n\\n== Style and technique ==\\n\\nActive as a painter for nearly six decades, Frankenthaler passed through many phases and stylistic shifts. Initially associated with abstract expressionism because of her focus on forms latent in nature, Frankenthaler is identified with the use of fluid shapes, abstract masses, and lyrical gestures. She made use of large formats on which she painted, generally, simplified abstract compositions. Her style is notable in its emphasis on spontaneity, as Frankenthaler herself stated, \"A really good picture looks as if it\\'s happened at once.\"\\nFrankenthaler\\'s official artistic career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of Mountains and Sea. Throughout the 1950s, her works tended to be centered compositions. In 1957, Frankenthaler began to experiment with linear shapes and more organic, sun-like, rounded forms. In the 1960s, her style shifted towards the exploration of symmetrical paintings, as she began to place strips of colors near the edges of her paintings. Her style grew to be more simplified. She began to make use of single stains and blots of solid color against white backgrounds, often in the form of geometric shapes. Beginning in 1963, Frankenthaler began to use acrylic paints rather than oil paints because they allowed for both opacity and sharpness when put on the canvas. By the 1970s, she had done away with the soak stain technique entirely, preferring thicker paint that allowed her to employ bright colors almost reminiscent of Fauvism. Throughout the 1970s, Frankenthaler explored the joining of areas of the canvas through the use of modulated hues, and experimented with large, abstract forms. Her work in the 1980s was characterized as much calmer, with its use of muted colors and relaxed brushwork. \"Once one\\'s true talent begins to emerge, one is freer in a way but less free in another way, since one is a captive of this necessity and deep urge\".\\n\\n\\n=== Color field painting ===\\n\\nIn 1960, the term color field painting was used to describe the work of Frankenthaler. In general, this term refers to the application of large areas, or fields, of color to the canvas. This style was characterized by the use of hues that were similar in tone or intensity, as well as large formats and simplified compositions, all of which are qualities descriptive of Frankenthaler\\'s work from the 1960s onward. The color field artists differed from abstract expressionists in their attempted erasure of emotional, mythic, and religious content.\\n\\n\\n=== Technique ===\\nFrankenthaler often painted onto unprimed canvas with oil paints that she heavily diluted with turpentine, a technique that she named \"soak stain.\" This allowed for the colors to soak directly into the canvas, creating a liquefied, translucent effect that strongly resembled watercolor. Soak stain was also said to be the ultimate fusing of image and canvas, drawing attention to the flatness of the painting itself. The major disadvantage of this method, however, is that the oil in the paints will eventually cause the canvas to discolor and rot away. The technique was adopted by other artists, notably Morris Louis (1912–1962) and Kenneth Noland (1924–2010), and launched the second generation of the color field school of painting.  Frankenthaler often worked by laying her canvas out on the floor, a technique inspired by Jackson Pollock.\\nFrankenthaler preferred to paint in privacy. If assistants were present, she preferred them to be inconspicuous when not needed.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nOne of her most important influences was Clement Greenberg (1909–1994), an art and literary critic with whom she had a personal friendship and who included her in the Post-Painterly Abstraction exhibition that he curated in 1964. Through Greenberg she was introduced to the New York art scene. Under his guidance she spent the summer of 1950 studying with Hans Hofmann (1880–1966), catalyst of the Abstract Expressionist movement.\\nThe first Jackson Pollock show Frankenthaler saw was at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1950. She had this to say about seeing Pollock\\'s paintings Autumn Rhythm, Number 30, 1950 (1950), Number One,1950 (Lavender Mist) (1950):\\n\\nIt was all there. I wanted to live in this land.  I had to live there, and master the language. \\nSome of her thoughts on painting:\\n\\nA really good picture looks as if it\\'s happened at once.  It\\'s an immediate image. For my own work, when a picture looks labored and overworked, and you can read in it—well, she did this and then she did that, and then she did that—there is something in it that has not got to do with beautiful art to me. And I usually throw these out, though I think very often it takes ten of those over-labored efforts to produce one really beautiful wrist motion that is synchronized with your head and heart, and you have it, and therefore it looks as if it were born in a minute.\\nJohn Elderfield wrote that the watercolors of Paul Cézanne and John Marin were important early influences:Watercolor... expands the brightness and flatness of plein-air painting because it visibly reveals these qualities in the whiteness of its support, which always makes its presence felt due to the insubstantiality of its covering. Marin and Cézanne were important to Frankenthaler not only for their watercolors or for the lightness of their work, but, more importantly, because both of them had liberated their oil paintings by treating them like watercolors, which was what Frankenthaler began to do... In Cézanne’s case this transposition of techniques also encouraged him to leave uncovered areas of white canvas between patches of thinned-down oil. This was especially interesting to Frankenthaler too.\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Paintings ===\\nIn Mountains and Sea, her first professionally exhibited work, Frankenthaler made use of the soak stain technique. The work itself was painted after a trip to Nova Scotia, which partly questions the extent of its non-representational status. Although Mountains and Sea is not a direct depiction of the Nova Scotia coastline, elements of the work suggest a kind of seascape or landscape, like the strokes of blue that join with areas of green. Much like Mountains and Sea, Frankenthaler\\'s Basque Landscape (1958) seems to refer to a very specific, external environment, but it is also abstract. The same can be said for Lorelei (1956), a work based on a boat ride Frankenthaler took down the Rhine.\\nSwan Lake #2 (1961) depicts a large area of blue paint on the canvas, with breaks in the color that are left white. A rectilinear brown square encompasses the blue, balancing both the cool tones of the blue with the warmth of the brown, and the gestural handling of the paint with the strong linearity of the square.\\nEden, from 1956, is an interior landscape, meaning it depicts the images of the artist\\'s imagination. Eden tells the story of an abstract, interior world, idealized in ways that a landscape never could be. The work is almost entirely gestural, save for the incorporation of the number \"100\" two times in the center of the image. When asked about the process of creating this work, Frankenthaler stated that she began by painting the numbers, and that a sort of symbolic, idealized garden grew out of that.\\n\\n\\n=== Prints and woodcuts ===\\nFrankenthaler recognized a need to continually challenge herself to develop as an artist. For this reason, in 1961, she began to experiment with printmaking at the Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a lithographic workshop in West Islip, Long Island. Frankenthaler collaborated with Tatyana Grosman in 1961 to create her first prints.\\nIn 1976, Frankenthaler began to work within the medium of woodcuts. She collaborated with Kenneth E. Tyler. The first piece they created together was Essence of Mulberry (1977), a woodcut that used eight different colors. Essence of Mulberry was inspired by two sources: the first was an exhibition of fifteenth century woodcuts that Frankenthaler saw on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the second being a mulberry tree that grew outside of Tyler\\'s studio. In 1995, the pair collaborated again, creating The Tales of Genji, a series of six woodcut prints. To create woodcuts with a resonance similar to Frankenthaler\\'s painterly style, she painted her plans onto the wood itself, making maquettes. The Tales of Genji took nearly three years to complete. Frankenthaler then went on to create Madame Butterfly, a print that employed one hundred and two different colors and forty-six woodblocks.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and legacy ==\\nFrankenthaler received the National Medal of Arts in 2001. She served on the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1985 to 1992. Her other awards include First Prize for Painting at the first Paris Biennial (1959); Temple Gold Medal, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia (1968); New York City Mayor\\'s Award of Honor for Arts and Culture (1986); and Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement, College Art Association (1994). In 1990, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\nFrankenthaler did not consider herself a feminist: \"For me, being a \\'lady painter\\' was never an issue. I don\\'t resent being a female painter. I don\\'t exploit it. I paint.\" Mary Beth Edelson\\'s feminist piece Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists including Frankenthaler collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\"\\nIn 1953, Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis saw her Mountains and Sea which, Louis said later, was a \"bridge between Pollock and what was possible.\" On the other hand, some critics called her work \"merely beautiful.\" Grace Glueck\\'s obituary in The New York Times summed up Frankenthaler\\'s career:\\n\\nCritics have not unanimously praised Ms. Frankenthaler\\'s art. Some have seen it as thin in substance, uncontrolled in method, too sweet in color and too \"poetic.\" But it has been far more apt to garner admirers like the critic Barbara Rose, who wrote in 1972 of Ms. Frankenthaler\\'s gift for \"the freedom, spontaneity, openness and complexity of an image, not exclusively of the studio or the mind, but explicitly and intimately tied to nature and human emotions.\\n\\n\\n=== Helen Frankenthaler Foundation ===\\nThe New York-based Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, established and endowed by the artist during her lifetime, is dedicated to promoting greater public interest in and understanding of the visual arts. In 2021 the foundation created Frankenthaler Climate Initiative. In July 2021, the foundation award the first round of grants totaling $5.1 million. The recipients included the Museo de Arte de Ponce, the Santa Rosa Indian Museum and Cultural Center, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Yale University Arts Center.\\nIn a 2023 lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, Frankenthaler’s nephew Frederick Iseman claimed that Clifford Ross and other family members on the board exploited the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation “to advance their own personal interests and careers” and were committed to completely shutting down the foundation in the near future.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nFrankenthaler\\'s first solo exhibition took place at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, in the fall of 1951. Her first major museum show, a retrospective of her 1950s work with a catalog by the critic and poet Frank O\\'Hara, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, was at the Jewish Museum in 1960. Subsequent solo exhibitions include \"Helen Frankenthaler,\" Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1969; traveled to Whitechapel Gallery, London; Orangerie Herrenhausen, Hanover; and Kongresshalle, Berlin), and \"Helen Frankenthaler: a Painting Retrospective,\" The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (1989–90; traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Detroit Institute of Arts). Miles McEnery Gallery, a New York-based contemporary art gallery which exhibited Color-Field and Abstract Expressionist paintings, showcased a range of her work in 2009 \"Helen Frankenthaler,\" December 10, 2009 – January 23, 2010). In 2016 her work was included in the exhibition Women of Abstract Expressionism organized by the Denver Art Museum. On October 6, 2019, Frankenthaler was included in Sparkling Amazons: Abstract Expressionist Women of the 9th St. Show at the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester County, NY. which ran until January 26, 2020; *2019: \"Postwar Women: alumnae of the Art Students League of New York 1945-1965\", Phyllis Harriman Gallery, Art Students League of NY; curated by Will Corwin.; 2020: \"9th Street Club\", Gazelli Art House, London; curated by Will Corwin\\nIn 2021, a decade after her death the New Britain Museum of American Art mounted an exhibition of her works on paper from the final stages of her opus titled \"Helen Frankenthaler; Late Works 1990 - 2003\".\\nIn 2023 her work was included in the exhibition Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-1970 at the Whitechapel Gallery in London.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nArt Gallery of Ontario, Toronto\\nArt Institute of Chicago\\nCentre Pompidou, Paris\\nThe Governor Nelson A.

In The New York Times in 1989, she argued government funding for the arts was \"not part of the democratic process\" and was \"beginning to spawn an art monster\". According to the Los Angeles Times, \"Frankenthaler did take a highly public stance during the late 1980s \\'culture wars\\' that eventually led to deep budget cuts for the National Endowment for the Arts and a ban on grants to individual artists that still persists. In a 1989 commentary for The New York Times, she wrote that, while \"censorship and government interference in the directions and standards of art are dangerous and not part of the democratic process,\" controversial grants to Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe, and others reflected a trend in which the NEA was supporting work \"of increasingly dubious quality.

Do we lose art ... in the guise of endorsing experimentation?\"\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nFrankenthaler died on December 27, 2011, at the age of 83 in Darien, Connecticut, following a long and undisclosed illness.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLyrical abstraction\\nWash (visual arts)\\nSunset Corner\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nAlexander Nemerov. 2021.

              "  'Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (born 1977) is a British painter and writer, of Ghanaian heritage. She is best known for her portraits of imaginary subjects, or ones derived from found objects, which are painted in muted colours. Her work has contributed to the renaissance in painting the Black figure. Her paintings often are presented in solo exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nLynette Yiadom-Boakye was born in London, UK where she currently lives and works. Her parents worked as nurses for the National Health Service after emigrating from Ghana in the 1960s. Yiadom-Boakye describes herself as \"a boring child--good grades, no mischief--but also quite good at living in my head, using my imagination as an escape.\" As a senior in high school, she took an art foundations course as an experiment and afterwards gave up her previous intentions to become an optician to become an artist Yiadom-Boakye attended Central St. Martins College of Art and Design (1996-7); however, she did not enjoy her time there, so she transferred to Falmouth College of Art (1997-2000) where she eventually was awarded her undergraduate degree in 2000. She then completed an MA degree at the Royal Academy Schools in 2003. It was there, in her final year of graduate school, that she came to a realization that changed the direction of her work, leading to her fame. In an interview with Dodie Kazanjian of Vogue she stated “Instead of trying to put complicated narratives into my work, I decided to simplify, and focus on just the figure and how it was painted. That in itself would carry the narrative.\" Following college she worked jobs to support herself until 2006 when she received Arts Foundation Fellowship for painting and was able to afford to focus solely on painting.\\nIn 2010 her work was recognized by Okwui Enwezor. With curator Naomi Beckwith, Okwui Enwezor catalogued her exhibition at Studio Museum in Harlem. She was among those nominated for the Turner prize in 2013. In addition to her artwork, Yiadom-Boakye has taught at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford University where she is a visiting tutor for their Master in Fine Arts programme. Her influence as a painter was recognized in the 2019 Powerlist and she was subsequently listed among the \"top 10\" of the most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK in 2020.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Artworks ===\\nYiadom-Boakye\\'s work consists mostly of painted portraits of imaginary Black subjects. Her paintings are predominantly figurative, with raw and muted colors. The characteristic dark palette of her work is known for creating a feeling of stillness that contributes to the timeless nature of her subjects. Her portraits of imaginary individuals feature people reading, lounging, and resting in traditional poses. She brings to the depiction of her subjects contemplative facial expressions and relaxed gestures, making their posture and mood relatable to many viewers. Commentators have attributed some of the acclaim of Yiadom-Boakye\\'s work to this relatability. She strives to keep her subjects from being associated with a particular decade or time; many of her art pieces depict figures/people of African descent. This results in choices such as not painting shoes on her subjects, as footwear often serves as a time stamp. These figures usually rest in front of ambiguous backgrounds, floating inside monochromatic dark hues. These cryptic, but emotional backdrops remind commentators of old masters such as Velasquez and Degas.\\nThe artist\\'s style shifted slightly after the opening of her 2017 show \"In Lieu of a Louder Love\". The show featured a new, warmer colour scheme. Her subjects in this show included more vibrant details such as a checkered linoleum-floor, a bold headwrap and bathing suit, and a yellow, orange, and green background.\\nAlthough each portrait only contains one person, the paintings typically are presented in groups that are arranged as if family portraits. With her expressive representations of the human figure, Yiadom-Boakye examines the formal mechanisms of the medium of painting and reveals political and psychological dimensions in her works, which focus on imaginary characters who exist beyond our world in a different time and in an unknown location. She paints figures who are intentionally removed from time and place, and has stated, \"People ask me, ‘Who are they, where are they?’\\u2009What they should be asking is ‘what\\' are they?\"\\nYiadom-Boakye takes inspiration for her paintings from the found objects she uses as well as personal memories, literature, and art history of painting. She also finds inspiration from music and artists including: Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Nick Drake, Lisa Yuskavage, Chris Offili, and Isaac Julien.\\nThe Tate Museum provides an introduction to her work that is extensive, to accompany a major exhibition of her work held from 2 December 2020 to 9 May 2021.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\nFor an artist, Yiadom-Boakye is unusual in describing herself as a writer as much as a painter—her short stories and prosy poems frequently appear in her catalogues.\\n\\nExamples of her works shown in catalogues includes five extracts from a detective novel entitled \"an Officer of the Law\" and some intermittent notes on criminality.  Her story \"an Officer of the Law\" is a fictional short story that utilizes animals for the characters. Yiadom-Boakye also creates poetry as shown in her intermittent note \"Something Close to a Confession.\" An example of this:\"Dead but for the life in me,\\nWhere Black rivers run in the Bath,\\nHaving eaten the Activist and her Cause\\nAnd alerted the Ugly to all their Flaws \\nI Bask where God cannot see me.\\nOn Vacant lot, my eyes make water\\n\\nAnd draw the blinds against a Slaughter.\"In talks about her work, the artist notes that her writing is to her as her painting is, and explains that she \"writes the things she doesn\\'t paint and paints all the things she doesn\\'t write\". Her paintings are given poetic titles.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nAt a 2019 auction at Phillips in London, Yiadom-Boakye\\'s Leave A Brick Under The Maple (2015), a life-size portrait of a standing man, sold for about $1 million.\\nAt the 2022 Christie\\'s 20th/21st Century Frieze Week season auction, Yiadom-Boakye\\'s Highpower was estimated at £600,000 and sold for £1,482,000\\n\\n\\n== Subject for work of others ==\\nPainted in 2017, Kehinde Wiley\\'s Portrait of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Jacob Morland of Capplethwaite is displayed in the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, CT.\\nA portrait of Yiadom-Boakye by photographer Sal Idriss is held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.\\nPoem After an Iteration of a Painting by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Destroyed by the Artist Herself by Ama Codje was published by the Massachusetts\\'s Review on December 26, 2019\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nYiadom-Boakye has staged numerous solo exhibitions at museums and galleries internationally. Her notable solo shows include Any Number of Preoccupations (2010), Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Verses After Dusk (2015), Serpentine Galleries, London; A Passion To A Principle (2016), Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Under-Song For a Cipher (2017), New Museum, New York; and Fly In League With The Night (2022-2023), Tate Britain, London.\\nShe has also participated in a number of group shows and exhibitions, including the 55th Venice Biennale (2013); the Sharjah Biennial (2015); 58th Venice Biennale (2019), and Afro-Atlantic Histories (2021-2022). Yiadom-Boakye\\'s work is included in several museum collections in the United States including the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami collection, and the picture King for an Hour was on view at the institution\\'s long-term display for 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nYiadom-Boakye has been widely hailed for her work, winning accolades including The Arts Foundation fellowship for painting (2006), the Pinchuk Foundation Future Generation Prize (2012), Next Generation Prize from the New Museum of Contemporary Art (2013), South Bank Sky Arts Award for Visual Art (2016) and the Carnegie Prize at 57th edition of Carnegie International (2018).

In 1968,  he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by Gordon Pask) and in 1972, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\\n\\n\\n== Interactive computer art ==\\nSince the 1960s, Ascott has been working with interactive computer art, telematic art, and systems art. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, Happenings, and Pop Art with the science of cybernetics. He was also influenced by the writings of Gordon Pask, Anthony Stafford Beer, William Ross Ashby, and F.H. George.\\n\\n\\n== International exhibitions ==\\nAscott has shown at the Venice Biennale, Shanghai Biennale, Electra Paris, Ars Electronica, V2 Institute for the Unstable Media, Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, Brazil, European Media Festival, and gr2000az at Graz, Austria. His first telematic project was La Plissure du Texte (1983), an online work of \"distributed authorship\" involving artists around the world. The second was his \"gesamtdatenwerk\" Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth (1989), an installation for the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, discussed by (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace, New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England,  then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at SPACE (studios) in Hackney, London in 2011. Syncretic Cybernetics, a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th Shanghai Biennale 2012. Roy Ascott: The Analogues (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute of Contemporary Arts, Winnipeg, July–Sept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award [2]. He discussed his work on Geran TV.\\nThe seminal work of 1962, \"Video-Roget\" was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in \"Electronic Superhighway\", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016. \"Art in Europe 1945–68\" shown in ZKM, Karlsruhr, Germany Oct 2016/ Jan 2017, included his \"Change-painting 1966\". His early work was the subject of the exhibition \"Roy Ascott: Form has Behaviour\", at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, Jan/Apr 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Books authored by Roy Ascott ==\\nThe Future is Now: Art, Technology, and Consciousness. 2012.Beijing: Gold Wall Press.2012\\nTelematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness.

              "  'Mark Bradford (born November 20, 1961) is an American visual artist. Bradford was born, lives, and works in Los Angeles and studied at the California Institute of the Arts. Recognized for his collaged painting works, which have been shown internationally, his practice also encompasses video, print, and installation. Bradford was the U.S. representative for the 2017 Venice Biennale. He was included in Time Magazine’s list of the 100 Most Influential People in 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBradford was born and raised in South Los Angeles. His mother rented a beauty salon in Leimert Park. Bradford moved with his family to a largely white neighborhood in Santa Monica when he was 11, but his mother still maintained her business in the old neighborhood. Bradford worked in her shop at times. When Bradford graduated high school, he obtained his hairdresser\\'s license and went to work at his mother\\'s salon.\\nBradford began his studies at Santa Monica College and then transferred to the California Institute of the Arts, graduating in 1991 at 30. He earned a BFA in 1995 and an MFA in 1997.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nBradford is known for grid-like abstract paintings combining collage with paint. His works are made out of layers of paper and cords which he carves into using various tools and techniques, including gouging, tearing, shredding, gluing, power-washing, and sanding.\\nThroughout Bradford\\'s career, he has collected ‘merchant posters’ printed sheets advertising services and posted in neighborhoods. According to critic Sebastian Smee, “The posters advertised cheap transitional housing, foreclosure prevention, food assistance, debt relief, wigs, jobs, DNA-derived paternity testing, gun shows and quick cash, as well as legal advice for immigrants, child custody and divorce.”\\nBradford sometimes incorporates ideas of masculinity and gender in his work, drawing on his experiences as a gay man.\\n\\n\\n=== Notable works ===\\nIn 2006, Bradford painted \\'Scorched Earth\\' and \\'Black Wall Street,\\' based on the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. Bradford revisited the theme for his 2021 painting ‘Tulsa Gottdamn’ to mark the centennial observance of the massacre.\\nBradford\\'s collage Orbit (2007) contains a magazine image of a basketball placed at the heart of a dense lattice of Los Angeles streets. Created by the cumulative and subtractive processes of collage and décollage, layered with paint, Orbit appears as an aerial view of a contorting, mutating, and decaying city whose tiny, intricate street grids can no longer maintain their structural integrity.  The image recalls Basquiat\\'s iconographies of black sports heroes, but Bradford\\'s treatment is far more ambivalent; after all, is the dream connoted by the basketball a beacon of hope or a false promise of the easiest exit from the inner city?\\nBradford\\'s A Truly Rich Man is One Whose Children Run into His Arms Even When His Hands Are Empty (2008) is nearly 9 feet wide and 9 feet tall. According to Maxwell Heller in The Brooklyn Rail, it calls to mind the charred and shattered windshields of cars burned in riots—black, webbed with streaks of light, sleek. He continues by saying that studying section by section offers traces of the artist\\'s sensual, tactile process, revealing delicate layers of found material sliced and sanded, lacquered and pasted until transformed.\\nBradford\\'s practice also encompasses video, print, and installation. His installation Mithra (2008) is a 70 x 20 x 25 ft ark constructed from salvaged plywood barricade fencing. He shipped it to New Orleans for Prospect New Orleans, an exhibition of contemporary art commemorating Hurricane Katrina. That same year, he created an installation inspired by Hurricane Katrina on the Steve Turner Contemporary Gallery roof, across the street from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It was restaged at the 55th Carnegie International.\\nIn 2012, Bradford narrated the soundtrack to the 30-minute, site-specific dance duet Framework by choreographer Benjamin Millepied in conjunction with the show The Painting Factory: Abstraction after Warhol at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\\nIn 2015, Mark Bradford created Pull Painting 1, a site-specific wall drawing inspired by Sol LeWitt along a 60-foot wall in the Wadsworth Atheneum, as part of the museum\\'s MATRIX 172 program. For this, Bradford applied dense layers of vibrantly colored paper, paint, and rope. He sanded, peeled, stripped, and cut away from the wall to create the textured composition.\\nThe same year, Bradford created Waterfall (2015) for his exhibition titled Be Strong Boquan at Hauser & Wirth, 18th Street, New York. Waterfall is composed of remnants of paper and rope peeled away from a pull painting, whose surface was built up by layering canvas with alternating sheets of billboard paper and rope. Through the process of pulling string across the canvas, Bradford created long fibrous ribbons of colored paper that revealed the archaeology of its host.\\nAlso in 2017, Bradford created \\'150 Portrait Tone\\', a wall painting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The mural features the text of the 911 call by Philando Castile\\'s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. According to LACMA\\'s website, \\'The title, 150 Portrait Tone, refers to the name and color code of the pink acrylic used throughout the painting. Like the now-obsolete “flesh” crayon in the Crayola 64 box (renamed “peach” in 1962), the color “portrait tone” carries inherent assumptions about who, exactly, is being depicted. In the context of Bradford’s painting, the title presents a sobering commentary on power and representation.\\'\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nIn 2014, Bradford created a large-scale work for the Tom Bradley International Terminal at the Los Angeles International Airport titled “Bell Tower” is a “huge, four-sided work, made from wood, and covered with color printed paper – bringing to mind the hand-bill covered wooden sidings that have inspired Bradford throughout his career.”\\nIn 2015 Bradford unveiled Elgin Gardens, a special commission for 1221 Avenue of the Americas at Rockefeller Center, New York, NY.\\nIn November 2017, Bradford presented Pickett\\'s Charge, a monumental cyclorama of paintings commissioned by the Smithsonian\\'s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. This work is based directly on the Gettysburg Cyclorama, a monumental installation at Gettysburg National Military Park which depicts Pickett\\'s Charge, the climactic assault in the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. At 400 linear feet of wall space, the installation is one of Bradford\\'s largest site-specific works. Also in 2017, Mark Bradford installed \\'We The People\\' at the US Embassy in London. Featuring fragments and full articles of the US Constitution, the large painting is made out of 32 separate canvases that occupy an entire wall in the atrium of the embassy.\\nIn December 2018, a monumental new commission by Bradford was unveiled at the University of California, San Diego Stuart Collection. Entitled \"WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT,\" the 195-foot-tall work is the tallest structure on the campus and takes the powerful influence of technology on communication as its point of departure.\\n\\n\\n=== Other projects ===\\nIn 2009, the Getty Museum invited Bradford to do a project of his choice with its education department. He chose teachers rather than students as his primary audience, bringing 10 other artists – including Michael Joo, Catherine Opie, Amy Sillman, and Kara Walker – to collaborate in developing free lesson plans for K-12 teachers.\\nFor one day only in August 2013, Project Hermés, a work by Mark Bradford installed in a private home in La Jolla, California, opened to the public before the building was eventually demolished.\\nIn conjunction with the 2017 U.S. Pavilion, Bradford embarked on a six-year collaboration with Venice nonprofit social cooperative Rio Terà dei Pensieri, which provides employment opportunities to men and women incarcerated in Venice who create artisanal goods and other products and supports their re-integration into society. Titled Process Collettivo, the Rio Terà dei Pensieri/Bradford collaboration aims to launch a sustainable long-term program that brings awareness to both the penal system and the success of the social cooperative model. A storefront located in the heart of Venice at San Polo 2599a is the initial manifestation of the collaboration.\\nIn October 2018, Bradford featured an image of Here, a mixed media on canvas work, on the Order of Service for Princess Eugenie of York\\'s wedding to Jack Brooksbank. The artwork was also displayed on the colorful sashes worn by the bridesmaids and pageboys in the wedding party.\\nIn advance of the inaugural Los Angeles edition of the Frieze Art Fair in January 2019, it was announced that Bradford had created a unique image of a police body camera entitled \"Life Size.\" Proceeds from sales of this limited-edition print series went directly to Agnes Gund\\'s Art for Justice Fund to help support greater career opportunities for people transitioning back home from prison. Bradford was the first artist since the Fund\\'s establishment to directly support the organization with proceeds from the sale of his artwork, and the initiative raised more than $1 million.\\nIn 2020, Bradford partnered with Snap Inc. to create a lens for the Snapchat app to drive voter registration among users aged 18–24. \\nAlso in 2020, accompanying ‘End Papers’ at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Bradford curated a set of three billboards throughout the city for the museum’s program Modern Billings. The billboards featured images of Mr. LaMarr, a popular hairdresser in 1970s and 80s St. Louis and a close associate of Bradford’s longtime friend, Cleo Hill-Jackson. Tiffany Wolf Smith, an assistant curator of education at the Modern, described Modern Billings as an opportunity to “insert art directly into our communities outside of our museum walls.”\\nTo accompany his exhibition ‘Masses & Movements’ in Menorca, Spain, Bradford collaborated with students from the local Escola d’Art de Menorca on a month-long art education residency that explored the global refugee crisis featuring maps of the world and immigration routes. The collaboration marked the inauguration of his initiative with PILA Global, an educational organization focused on displaced and impoverished families.\\n\\n\\n=== Art + Practice ===\\nIn 2013, Mark Bradford, the philanthropist Eileen Harris Norton, and neighborhood activist Allan DiCastro established Art + Practice, an organization based in Leimert Park that encourages engagement with the arts. Additionally, with collaborator First Place for Youth, it supports local 18- to 24-year-olds who are transitioning out of foster care. Bradford, DiCastro, and Norton are long-term residents of South Los Angeles and have witnessed first-hand how a lack of educational and social resources can affect the community. The trio created Art + Practice as a developmental platform for transitional age youth, stressing the importance of creative activity and practical skills for personal transformation and social change.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1998, Bradford had a solo show, Distribution, at L.A.\\'s Deep River, a gallery started by artist Daniel Joseph Martinez and artist Glenn Kaino.\\nIn 2001, Thelma Golden included Bradford\\'s hairdressing end-paper collages Enter and Exit the New Negro (2000) and \\'Dreadlocks Can\\'t tell me shit\\' (2000) in the breakthrough \\'Freestyle\\' exhibition of 28 African American artists at the Studio Museum in Harlem. The use of hairdressing endpapers alludes to Bradford\\'s former career as a hairdresser in his mother\\'s hair salon in Leimert Park, South Los Angeles.\\nBradford has exhibited at the Wexner Center for the Arts, USA Today at the Royal Academy in London, \\'In Site\\' at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and the Centro Cultural de Tijuana, \\'ARCO 2003\\' in Madrid, the Liverpool Biennial (2006), the Sao Paulo Biennial (2006), Whitney Biennial (2006), the Sikkema Jenkins Gallery, Street Level (2007) at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, the Carnegie Museum of Art (2008), the Ohio State University (2010), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2011), the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2011), and at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2012), and participated in the 9th Gwangju Biennale (2012).\\nIn 2014, Bradford presented The King\\'s Mirror. This 100-feet-long mural consisted of 300 individual works mounted on plywood, each measuring 22 by 28 inches, and which remained in situ at the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University for a year.\\nIn January 2015, Bradford presented \"Tears of a Tree,\" a new body of work at The Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai, China. In June 2015 \\'Mark Bradford: Sea Monsters\\' toured from the Rose Art Museum to Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, Netherlands.\\nAlso in 2015, Bradford presented \\'Scorched Earth,\\' his first solo museum exhibition in Los Angeles, at the Hammer Museum. (\\'Scorched Earth\\' was subsequently moved to The Broad Museum. ) The exhibition showcased a suite of new paintings, multimedia, and a major painting on the Lobby Wall.\\nIn May 2017, The Baltimore Museum of Art and The Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of State\\'s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, presented Mark Bradford as the representative for the United States at La Biennale di Venezia 57th International Art Exhibition. Bradford\\'s exhibition, titled \\'Tomorrow Is Another Day,\\' garnered extensive critical acclaim, and Bradford was lauded as \\'our Jackson Pollock.\\'\\nIn December 2017, it was announced that Bradford would inaugurate Hauser & Wirth\\'s gallery space in Hong Kong with a body of new work. The exhibition, which opened on March 27, 2018, comprised a number of new large-scale paintings as well as works that incorporate merchant posters found on the streets.\\nMark Bradford: New Works, Bradford\\'s first gallery exhibition in his hometown of Los Angeles in over 15 years, opened on February 17, 2018. Featuring ten new works, the exhibition continued its investigations into the technical and sociopolitical potentials of abstract painting. Among the paintings on view was Moody Blues for Jack Whitten (2018), a composition of lines and shades of blue that Bradford initiated before the death of his friend Jack Whitten, and completed for this exhibition.\\nIn September 2018, The Baltimore Museum of Art opened Tomorrow Is Another Day, a re-staging of Bradford\\'s exhibition at La Biennale di Venezia 57th International Art Exhibition. As part of the exhibition, Bradford collaborated with children and staff from the Greenmount West Community Center to silkscreen merchandise on sale in a permanent pop-up shop in the museum. One hundred percent of the proceeds go directly back to the center.\\nOn July 27, 2019, the Long Museum in Shanghai, China, opened \\'Mark Bradford: Los Angeles,\\' the artist\\'s largest exhibition in China. The exhibition featured a new, site-specific sculpture, “Float,” in response to the museum\\'s architecture and a series of large-scale paintings about the Watts riots in Los Angeles in 1965. The Long Museum agreed to make admission to Los Angeles free to the public throughout the exhibition.\\nOn October 1, 2019, Hauser & Wirth opened, ‘Cerberus,’ the artist\\'s first exhibition in the gallery\\'s London space. The exhibition consisted of nine large-scale paintings and a video titled “Dancing in the Street.” The title of the exhibition is based on the mythological figure of Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek mythology that guards the entryway to Hades.\\nIn 2020 and during the Covid-19 Pandemic, Bradford conducted an Online Exhibition titled - \"Quarantine Paintings.\" The exhibition consisted of three paintings the artist had created whilst in lockdown.\\nAlso in 2020, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth mounted a survey exhibition featuring a large selection of Bradford’s earliest paintings, created from endpapers. The exhibition draws a line from his use of endpapers to his later use of other types of paper, such as merchant posters, advertising broadsides, and billboards around Los Angeles.\\n‘Masses & Movements,’ a solo Bradford exhibition with Hauser & Wirth, inaugurated the gallery’s newest location in Menorca, Spain, on July 19, 2021. The exhibition consisted of an installation of globe sculptures, a two-part site-specific wall painting, and 16 works on canvas based on Martin Waldseemüller’s map from 1507, the first to use the name ‘America.’\\nIn November 2021, Bradford opened ‘Agora,’ curated by Philippe Vergne, at the Fundação de Serralves. The survey exhibition features work from the last three years, including a series of new paintings based on the Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries, a selection of paintings based on the myth of ‘Cerbrus,’ and Bradford’s Quarantine Paintings.\\n\\n\\n== Honors and awards ==\\nBradford is a recipient of a Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant (2002), a grant from the Nancy Graves Foundation Grant (2002), the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2003), the United States Artists fellowship (2006), the Bucksbaum Award, granted by The Whitney Museum of American Art (2006); a grant from the MacArthur Fellows Program (2009) (also called the \"MacArthur Genius Award\") and the Wexner Center Residency Award (2009).\\nIn 2013, the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts in New York elected him as a National Academician.

              "  'Andy Goldsworthy  (born 25 July 1956) is an English sculptor, photographer, and environmentalist who produces site-specific sculptures and land art situated in natural and urban settings.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nGoldsworthy was born in Cheshire on 25 July 1956, the son of Muriel (née Stanger) and F. Allin Goldsworthy (1929–2001), a former professor of applied mathematics at the University of Leeds. He grew up on the Harrogate side of Leeds. From the age of 13, he worked on farms as a labourer. He has likened the repetitive quality of farm tasks to the routine of making sculpture: \"A lot of my work is like picking potatoes; you have to get into the rhythm of it.\" He studied fine art at Bradford College of Art from 1974 to 1975 and at Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire) from 1975 to 1978, receiving his BA from the latter.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\n\\nAfter leaving college, Goldsworthy lived in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria. He moved to Scotland in 1985, first living in Langholm and then settling a year later in Penpont, where he still resides. It has been said that his gradual drift northwards was \"due to a way of life over which he did not have complete control\", but that contributing factors were opportunities and desires to work in these areas and \"reasons of economy\".\\nIn 1993, Goldsworthy received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford. He was an A.D. White Professor-At-Large in Sculpture at Cornell University 2000–2006 and 2006–2008.\\nIn 2003, Goldsworthy produced a commissioned work for the entry courtyard of San Francisco\\'s de Young Museum called \"Drawn Stone\", which echoes San Francisco\\'s frequent earthquakes and their effects. His installation included a giant crack in the pavement that broke off into smaller cracks, and broken limestone, which could be used for benches. The smaller cracks were made with a hammer adding unpredictability to the work as he created it.\\n\\n\\n=== Art process ===\\nThe materials used in Goldsworthy\\'s art often include brightly coloured flowers, icicles, leaves, mud, pinecones, snow, stone, twigs, and thorns. He has been quoted as saying, \"I think it\\'s incredibly brave to be working with flowers and leaves and petals. But I have to: I can\\'t edit the materials I work with. My remit is to work with nature as a whole.\"\\nRather than interfering in natural processes, his work magnifies existing ones through deliberately minimal intervention in the landscape. Goldsworthy has said “I am reluctant to carve into or break off solid living rock…I feel a difference between large, deep rooted stones and the debris lying at the foot of a cliff, pebbles on a beach…These are loose and unsettled, as if on a journey, and I can work with them in ways I couldn’t with a long resting stone.” Goldsworthy’s commitment to working with available natural materials injects an inherent scarcity and contingency into the work.\\nIn contrast to other artists who work with the land, most of Goldsworthy’s works are small in scale and temporary in their installation. For these ephemeral works, Goldsworthy often uses only his bare hands, teeth, and found tools to prepare and arrange the materials. His process reveals a preoccupation with temporality and a specific attention to materials which visibly age and decay, a view which stands in contrast to monumentalism in Land Art.\\nFor his permanent sculptures like \"Roof\", \"Stone River\" and \"Three Cairns\", \"Moonlit Path\" (Petworth, West Sussex, 2002) and \"Chalk Stones\" in the South Downs, near West Dean, West Sussex he has employed the use of machine tools. To create \"Roof\", Goldsworthy worked with his assistant and five British dry-stone wallers, who were used to make sure the structure could withstand time and nature.\\nGoldsworthy is generally considered the founder of modern rock balancing.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nPhotography plays a crucial role in his art due to its often ephemeral and transient state. Photographs (made primarily by Goldsworthy himself) of site-specific, environmental works allow them to be shared without severing important ties to place. According to Goldsworthy, \"Each work grows, stays, decays – integral parts of a cycle which the photograph shows at its heights, marking the moment when the work is most alive. There is an intensity about a work at its peak that I hope is expressed in the image. Process and decay are implicit.\"\\nPhotography aids Goldsworthy in understanding his works, as much as in communicating them to an audience. He has said, “Photography is my way of talking, writing and thinking about my art. It makes me aware of connections and developments that might have not otherwise have been apparent. It is the visual evidence which runs through my art as a whole and gives me a broader, more distant view of what I am doing.”\\n\\n\\n=== Documentary films on Goldsworthy ===\\nGoldsworthy is the subject of a 2001 documentary feature film called Rivers and Tides, directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer. In 2018, Riedelsheimer released a second documentary on Goldsworthy titled Leaning Into the Wind.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1982, Goldsworthy married Judith Gregson; they had four children together before separating. He now lives in the Scottish village of Penpont with his girlfriend, Tina Fiske, an art historian.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n1979 – North West Arts Award\\n1980 – Yorkshire Arts Award\\n1981 – Northern Arts Award\\n1982 – Northern Arts Award\\n1986 – Northern Arts Bursary\\n1987 – Scottish Arts Council Award\\n1989 – Northern Electricity Arts Award\\n2000 – Appointed officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and installations ==\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nAndy Goldsworthy (1985).

              "  'Tim Hawkinson (born 1960) is an American artist who mostly works as a sculptor.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nHawkinson was born in San Francisco, California in 1960. He received a BFA from San Jose State University in 1984, and a MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1989.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nHawkinson′s work is mostly sculptural, ranging in scale from minute to huge. His themes include his own body (although some of his work could be called self portraiture), music, and the passing of time, as well as his artistic engagement with material, technique, and process. Some of his pieces are mechanized (the mechanism usually fully on view), or involve sound.\\nHawkinson is renowned for creating complex sculptural systems through surprisingly simple means. His installation “Überorgan”—a stadium-size, fully automated bagpipe—was pieced together from bits of electrical hardware and several miles of inflated plastic sheeting. Hawkinson’s fascination with music and notation can also be seen in “Pentecost,” a work in which the artist tuned cardboard tubes and assembled them in the shape of a giant tree. On this tree the artist placed twelve life-size robotic replicas of himself, and programmed them to beat out hymns at humorously irregular intervals. The source of inspiration for many of Hawkinson’s pieces has been the re-imagining of his own body and what it means to make a self-portrait of this new or fictionalized body. In 1997 the artist created an exacting, two-inch tall skeleton of a bird from his own fingernail parings, and later made a feather and egg from his own hair. Believable even at a close distance, these works reveal Hawkinson’s attention to detail as well as his obsession with life, death, and the passage of time. \\nIn 2015, Hawkinson received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fine arts. \\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHawkinson has exhibited at the Venice Biennale (1999), the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, (2000), the Power Plant in Toronto, Canada (2000), the Whitney Biennial (2002), and the 2003 Corcoran Biennial in Washington, D.C.\\nA 2009 exhibition of new works included sculptures crafted from eggshells and a life-sized motorcycle constructed out of feathers. It was on view from May 8 through July  4, 2009 at The Pace Gallery, New York. Wonzimer Gallery in Los Angeles exhibited Hawkinson in the 2020 show \"The Shape of Life.\"\\n\\n\\n== Permanent collections ==\\nHis 2005 sculpture Bear is a part of the Stuart Collection of public art on the campus of the University of California San Diego.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nHawkinson lives in Los Angeles with his wife, artist Patty Wickman.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nLawrence Rinder. 2005, Tim Hawkinson (Whitney Museum of American Art)\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nBiography, interviews, essays, artwork images and video clips from PBS series Art:21 -- Art in the Twenty-First Century  - Season 2 (2003).\\nDoug Harvey\\'s LA Weekly review of Hawkinson\\'s Mid-Career Survey',\n",
              "  'Nam June Paik (Korean: 백남준; RR: Baek Nam-jun; July 20, 1932 – January 29, 2006) was a Korean artist. He worked with a variety of media and is considered to be the founder of video art. He is credited with the first use (1974) of the term \"electronic super highway\" to describe the future of telecommunications.\\nBorn in Seoul to a wealthy business family, Paik trained as a classical musician, spending time in Japan and West Germany, where he joined the Fluxus collective and developed a friendship with experimental composer John Cage. He moved to New York City in 1964 and began working with cellist Charlotte Moorman to create performance art. Soon after, he began to incorporate televisions and video tape recorders into his work, acquiring growing fame. A stroke in 1996 left him partially paralyzed for the last decade of his life.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Seoul in 1932 in present-day South Korea, the youngest of five children, Paik had two older brothers and two older sisters. His father, who in 2002 was revealed to be a Chinilpa, or a Korean who collaborated with the Japanese during the latter\\'s occupation of Korea, owned a major textile manufacturing firm. As he was growing up, he was trained as a classical pianist. By virtue of his affluent background, Paik received an elite education in modern (largely Western) music through his tutors.:\\u200a43\\u200a\\nIn 1950, during the Korean War, Paik and his family fled from their home in Korea, first fleeing to Hong Kong, but later moved to Japan. Paik graduated with a BA in aesthetics from the University of Tokyo in 1956, where he wrote a thesis on the composer Arnold Schoenberg.\\nPaik then moved to West Germany in 1957 to study music history with composer Thrasybulos Georgiades at Munich University.:\\u200a19\\u200a While studying in Germany, Paik met the composers Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage and the conceptual artists Sharon Grace, George Maciunas, Joseph Beuys, and Wolf Vostell.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn 1961, Paik returned to Tokyo to explore the country\\'s advanced technologies.:\\u200a14\\u200a While living in Japan between 1962 and 1963, Paik first acquired a Sony Portapak, the first commercially available video recorder, perhaps by virtue of his close friendship with Nobuyuki Idei, who was an executive at (and later president of) the Sony corporation.:\\u200a19–20\\u200a\\nFrom 1962, Paik was a member of the experimental art movement Fluxus.\\nIn 1964, Paik immigrated to the United States of America and began living in New York City, where he began working with classical cellist Charlotte Moorman, to combine his video, music, and performance.:\\u200a20\\u200a\\nFrom 1979 to 1996 Paik was professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.\\nAfter nearly 35 years of being exiled from his motherland of Korea,:\\u200a43\\u200a Paik returned to South Korea on June 22, 1984.:\\u200a152\\u200a From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Paik played an integral role in Korea\\'s art scene. As the curator Lee Sooyon has argued, Paik became more than just an illustrious visitor to Korea, he became the leader who helped open Korea\\'s art scene to the broader international art world.:\\u200a154\\u200a \\nHe opened solo exhibitions in Korea and mounted two world-wide broadcast projects for the 1986 Asia Games and the 1988 Olympics, both hosted in Seoul, and organized a number of exhibitions in Korea. Some exhibitions coordinated by Paik introduced John Cage, Merce Cunningham, and Joseph Beuys to Korea\\'s art scene; others brought recent developments in video art and interactivity from Europe and the U.S. to Korea, in ways that bridged similar activities in Korea\\'s art scene.:\\u200a154\\u200a Paik was also involved in bringing the 1993 Whitney Biennial to Seoul, as well as in founding the Gwangju Biennale and establishing the Korea Pavilion at the Venice Biennale.\\nBeginning with his artistic career in Germany in the 1960s—and on through his immigration to the U.S., later involvement in South Korea\\'s art scene, and broader participation in international artistic currents—Paik\\'s transnational path informed both his identity and his artistic practice in complex ways.:\\u200a48\\u200a At the outset of his career in Europe, Paik declared, \"The yellow peril! C\\'est moi,\" in a 1964 pamphlet, a reference to his Asian identity that, as the curators June Yap and Lee Soo-yon have noted, appropriates a xenophobic phrase coined by Kaiser Wilhelm II as Paik referenced his Asian identity.:\\u200a158\\u200a  \\nCurator John Hanhardt observed that certain works recall Paik\\'s lived experience of transnational immigration from South Korea to Japan, Germany, and on the U.S.; one example is Guadalcanal Requiem (1977), which invokes \"the history and memories of World War II in the Pacific.\":\\u200a43\\u200a Hanhardt has also concluded that—though \"no single story\" of Nam June Paik can capture the complexity of who he was and the places that shaped him—as Paik grew in public, transcultural, and global recognition, he held onto the significance of his birthplace in Korea.:\\u200a48\\u200a Similarly, the curator Lee Sook-kyung has called identifying what is Korea, Japanese, American, or German about Nam June Paik to be a \"futile\" effort,:\\u200a9\\u200a yet she has observed that Paik consistently emphasized his Korean heritage and \"Mongolian\" lineages.:\\u200a135\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\nNam June Paik then began participating in the Neo-Dada art movement, known as Fluxus, which was inspired by the composer John Cage and his use of everyday sounds and noises in his music. He made his big debut in 1963 at an exhibition known as Exposition of Music-Electronic Television at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal in which he scattered televisions everywhere and used magnets to alter or distort their images. In a 1960 piano performance in Cologne, he played Chopin, threw himself on the piano and rushed into the audience, attacking Cage and pianist David Tudor by cutting their clothes with scissors and dumping shampoo on their heads.\\nCage suggested Paik look into Zen Buddhism. Though Paik was already well familiar with Buddhism from his childhood in Korea and Japan, Cage\\'s interest in Zen philosophy compelled Paik to re-examine his own intellectual and cultural foundation.:\\u200a13\\u200a\\nDuring 1963 and 1964 the engineers Hideo Uchida and Shuya Abe showed Paik how to interfere with the flow of electrons in color TV sets, work that led to the Abe-Paik video synthesizer, a key element in his future TV work.\\nIn 1965, Paik acquired a Sony TCV-2010, a combination unit that contained the first consumer-market video-tape recorder CV-2000. Paik used this VTR to record television broadcasts, frequently manipulating the qualities of the broadcast, and the magnetic tape in process. In 1967 Sony introduced the first truly portable VTR, which featured a portable power supply and handheld camera, the Sony Portapak. With this, Paik could both move and record things, for it was the first portable video and audio recorder. From there, Paik became an international celebrity, known for his creative and entertaining works.\\nIn a notorious 1967 incident, Moorman was arrested for going topless while performing in Paik\\'s Opera Sextronique. Two years later, in 1969, they performed TV Bra for Living Sculpture, in which Moorman wore a bra with small TV screens over her breasts. Throughout this period it was Paik\\'s goal to bring music up to speed with art and literature, and make sex an acceptable theme. One of his Fluxus concept works (\"Playable Pieces\") instructs the performer to \"Creep into the Vagina of a living Whale.\" Of the \"Playable Pieces,\" the only one actually to have been performed was by Fluxus composer Joseph Byrd (\"Cut your left forearm a distance of ten centimeters.\") in 1964 at UCLA\\'s New Music Workshop.\\nIn 1971, Paik and Moorman made TV Cello, a cello formed out of three television sets stacked up on top of each other and some cello strings.  During Moorman\\'s performance with the object, she drew her bow across the \"cello,\" as images of her and other cellists playing appeared on the screens. Paik and Moorman created another TV Cello in 1976 as a Kaldor Public Art Project in Sydney, Australia.\\nIn 1974 Nam June Paik used the term \"super highway\" in application to telecommunications, which gave rise to the opinion that he may have been the author of the phrase \"Information Superhighway\". In fact, in his 1974 proposal \"Media Planning for the Postindustrial Society – The 21st Century is now only 26 years away\" to the Rockefeller Foundation he used a slightly different phrase, \"electronic super highway\":\\n\\n\"The building of new electronic super highways will become an even huger enterprise. Assuming we connect New York with Los Angeles by means of an electronic telecommunication network that operates in strong transmission ranges, as well as with continental satellites, wave guides, bundled coaxial cable, and later also via laser beam fiber optics: the expenditure would be about the same as for a Moon landing, except that the benefits in term of by-products would be greater.\\nAlso in the 1970s, Paik imagined a global community of viewers for what he called a Video Common Market which would disseminate videos freely. In 1978, Paik collaborated with Dimitri Devyatkin to produce a light hearted comparison of life in two major cities, Media Shuttle: New York-Moscow on WNET. The video is held in museum collections around the world.\\nPossibly Paik\\'s most famous work, TV Buddha is a video installation depicting a Buddha statue viewing its own live image on a closed circuit TV. Paik created numerous versions of this work using different statues, the first version is from 1974.\\n\\nAnother piece, Positive Egg, displays a white egg on a black background. In a series of video monitors, increasing in size, the image on the screen becomes larger and larger, until the egg itself becomes an abstract, unrecognizable shape. In Video Fish, from 1975, a series of aquariums arranged in a horizontal line contain live fish swimming in front of an equal number of monitors which show video images of other fish.\\nPaik completed an installation in 1993 in the NJN Building in Trenton, NJ. This work was commissioned under the public building arts inclusion act of 1978. The installation\\'s media is neon lights incorporated around video screens. This particular piece is currently non-operational, though there are plans to make necessary upgrades/repairs to restore it to working order.\\nDuring the New Year\\'s Day celebration on January 1, 1984, he aired Good Morning, Mr. Orwell, a live link between WNET New York, Centre Pompidou Paris, and South Korea. With the participation of John Cage, Salvador Dalí, Laurie Anderson, Joseph Beuys, Merce Cunningham, Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, George Plimpton, and other artists, Paik showed that George Orwell\\'s Big Brother had not arrived.\\nAs the curator Suh Jinsuk has observed, after returning to Korea in 1984, Nam June Paik increasingly explored symbols of global exchange with Asia, such as the Silk Road and Eurasia.:\\u200a22\\u200a Moreover, as Paik became involved in Korea\\'s art scene, he spearheaded projects that drew upon his connections with business and government circles in South Korea. Bye Bye Kipling, a tape that mixed live events from Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; and New York, USA, demonstrates this new phase in Paik\\'s practice. Broadcast on the occasion of the Asia Games in Seoul, Bye Bye Kipling\\'s title referenced a poem by Rudyard Kipling, \"East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,\" as it fostered collaborations such as between the American artist Keith Haring and the Japan-based fashion designer Issey Miyake.:\\u200a145\\u200a As curator Lee Sooyon has argued, Bye Bye Kipling also contributed to the Korea government\\'s agendas of \"the advancement and internationalization of culture\" by bringing together video sketches of shaman rituals and Korean drum dancers with Seoul\\'s \"economic miracle\" and the bustling business of Namdaemun Market.:\\u200a162\\u200a\\nTwo years later, in 1988 Paik installed The More, The Better in the atrium of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Gwacheon. A giant tower, the work is made of 1003 monitors—a number that references October 3 as the day of Korea was founded by Dangun, according to legend. The More, The Better appears prominently in Paik\\'s 1988 broadcast Wrap Around the World, which was made for the Seoul Olympics.:\\u200a152\\u200a\\nFor the German pavilion at the 1993 Venice Biennale, Paik created an array of robot sculptures of historic figures, such as Catherine the Great and the legendary founder of Korea, Dangun, so as to emphasize the connections between Europe and Asia.:\\u200a135\\u200a\\nPaik\\'s 1995 piece Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, is on permanent display at the Lincoln Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\\nPaik was known for making robots out of television sets. These were constructed using pieces of wire and metal, but later Paik used parts from radio and television sets.\\nDespite his stroke, in 2000, he created a millennium satellite broadcast entitled Tiger is Alive and in 2004 designed the installation of monitors and video projections Global Groove 2004 for the Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nPaik\\'s first exhibition, entitled \"Exposition of Music – Electronic Television\", was held in 1963 at Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany. A retrospective of Paik\\'s work was held at the Whitney Museum in New York City in the spring of 1982. Major retrospectives of Paik\\'s work have been organized by Kölnischer Kunstverein (1976), Musée d\\'art moderne de la Ville de Paris (1978), Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City (1982), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1989), and the Kunsthalle Basel (1991).\\nNam June Paik\\'s first major retrospective in Korea, Video Time – Video Space, opened at the Gwacheon location of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea on July 30, 1992.:\\u200a154\\u200a Although the exhibition lasted merely 34 days, it saw 117,961 paid visitors; the unofficial visitor count reached nearly 200,000.:\\u200a154\\u200a The exhibition involved the participation of major entities of media and business—including the Korea Broadcasting Corporation and Samsung Electronics.:\\u200a154\\u200a  The exhibition presented approximately 150 artworks, beginning with The More, The Better as the exhibition\\'s starting point.:\\u200a156\\u200a According to Lee Sooyon, Paik carefully tailored the exhibition\\'s works to his audiences. Knowing that Korea\\'s audience was not familiar with international art world conversations of video art, Fluxus, and performance art, Paik selected artworks that appealed to popular subjects of Korean culture and history.:\\u200a156\\u200a  The exhibition also featured works from Paik\\'s TV Buddha and My Faust series.:\\u200a156\\u200a\\nA final retrospective of his work was held in 2000 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, with the commissioned site-specific installation Modulation in Sync (2000) integrating the unique space of the museum into the exhibition itself. This coincided with a downtown gallery showing of video artworks by his wife Shigeko Kubota, mainly dealing with his recovery from a stroke he had in 1996.\\nIn 2011, an exhibition centered on Paik\\'s video sculpture One Candle, Candle Projection (1988–2000) opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Another retrospective was mounted at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2012–2013. As a leading expert in Paik\\'s work, art historian John G. Hanhardt was the curator for three landmark exhibitions devoted to the artist, the ones at the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\\nPaik\\'s work also appeared in important group exhibitions such as São Paulo Biennale (1975), Whitney Biennial (1977, 1981, 1983, 1987, and 1989), Documenta 6 and 8 (1977 and 1987), and Venice Biennale (1984 and 1993).\\nFrom April 24, 2015, to September 7, 2015, Paik\\'s works T.V. Clock, 9/23/69: Experiment with David Atwood, and ETUDE1 were displayed at \"Watch This! Revelations in Media Art\" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.\\nAlthough Paik\\'s pioneering experimentalism and foresight of the important role media would continue to play in society has been examined across many exhibitions, for a 2019 exhibition, the Tate Modern turned its focus upon Paik as a collaborator.:\\u200a6\\u200a:\\u200a152\\u200a This exhibition later travelled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, where it was presented at the first West-coast retrospective of Paik\\'s work from May 8, 2021, through October 3, 2021. It was later presented at the National Gallery Singapore from 10 December 2021 to 27 March 2022, a first time that such an expansive and ambitious presentation of Paik’s oeuvre was presented in Southeast Asia \\nIn late 2022, the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, will present an exhibition that focuses on Paik as cultural organizer who made an immense impact upon South Korea\\'s art scene; it aims to bring into greater focus Paik\\'s relationship with national identity.:\\u200a152\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nPublic collections that hold or have exhibited work by Nam June Paik include:\\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit, USA),\\nThe National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (Seoul, South Korea),\\nLeeum, Samsung Museum of Art (Seoul, South Korea),\\nThe Nam June Paik Art Center (Yongin, South Korea),\\nThe Ackland Art Museum (University of North Carolina, USA),\\nThe Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo, USA),\\nMercedes-Benz Art Collection (Berlin, Germany),\\nFukuoka Art Museum (Fukuoka, Japan),\\nThe Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington D.C., USA),\\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art (Honolulu, USA),\\nKunsthalle zu Kiel (University of Kiel, Germany),\\nKunstmuseum St. Gallen (St. Gallen, Switzerland),\\nKunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen (Düsseldorf, Germany),\\nLudwig Forum für Internationale Kunst (Aachen, Germany),\\nMusée d\\'Art Moderne (Paris, France),\\nMuseum Wiesbaden (Wiesbaden, Germany),\\nThe National Gallery of Australia (Canberra, Australia),\\nNational Gallery of Victoria (Melbourne, Australia),\\nThe Berardo Collection Museum (Lisbon, Portugal),\\nNational Museum of Contemporary Art (Athens, Greece),\\nPalazzo Cavour (Turin, Italy),\\nThe Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (Brussels, Belgium),\\nThe Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam, The Netherlands),\\nSchleswig-Holstein Museum (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany),\\nThe Smart Museum of Art (University of Chicago, USA),\\nSmith College Museum of Art (Northhampton, USA),\\nHessel Museum of Art at Bard College, (Annandale-on-Hudson, USA)\\nThe Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C., USA),\\nThe Stuart Collection (University of California, USA),\\nThe  Dayton Art Institute (Dayton, USA)\\nThe Walker Art Center (Minneapolis, USA),\\nThe Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art at Cornell University Library, (Ithaca, USA),\\nThe Worcester Art Museum (Worcester, USA),\\nReynolda House Museum of American Art (Winston-Salem, USA).\\nColección SOLO (Madrid, Spain)\\nWhitney Museum of American Art (New York, USA)\\nThe Bass Museum of Art (Miami, USA)\\n\\n\\n== Honours and awards ==\\n1991: Goslarer Kaiserring\\n1993: Golden Lion, Venice Biennale (With Hans Haacke)\\n1995: Ho-Am Prize in the Arts\\n1998: Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy\\n2000: Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)\\n2001: Wilhelm Lehmbruck Prize, awarded by the City of Duisburg\\n2001: Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award, International Sculpture Center.\\n2004: Edward MacDowell Medal in the Arts\\n\\n\\n== Archive ==\\nGiven its largely antiquated technology, Paik\\'s oeuvre poses a unique conservation challenge. In 2006, Nam June Paik\\'s estate asked a group of museums for proposals on how each would use the archive. Out of a group that included the Museum of Modern Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, it chose the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The archive includes Paik\\'s early writings on art history, history and technology; correspondence with other artists and collaborators like Charlotte Moorman, John Cage, George Maciunas and Wolf Vostell; and a complete collection of videotapes used in his work, as well as production notes, television work, sketches, notebooks, models and plans for videos. It also covers early-model televisions and video projectors, radios, record players, cameras and musical instruments, toys, games, folk sculptures and the desk where he painted in his SoHo studio.\\nCurator John Hanhardt, an old friend of Paik, said of the archive: \"It came in great disorder, which made it all the more complicated.  It is not like his space was perfectly organized.  I think the archive is like a huge memory machine.  A wunderkammer, a wonder cabinet of his life.\" Hanhardt describes the archives in the catalog for the 2012 Smithsonian show in the book Nam June Paik: Global Visionary.\\nMichael Mansfield, associate curator of film and media arts at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, supervised the complex installation of several hundred CRT TV sets, the wiring to connect them all, and the software and servers to drive them. He developed an app on his phone to operate every electronic artwork on display.\\nMany of Paik\\'s early works and writings are collected in a volume edited by Judson Rosebush titled Nam June Paik: Videa \\'n\\' Videology 1959–1973, published by the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, New York, in 1974.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\nAs a pioneer of video art his influence was from a student he met at CalArts named Sharon Grace he described her as \"pure genius\" from the moment they met.  The two met while she was filming fellow students at random with her Sony Portapak as an artistic sociological practice akin to the artist in the studio. This led to TV Buddha and people\\'s model of the internet as we know it today with such art pieces as \"Send / Receive\". The artwork and ideas of Nam June Paik were a major influence on late 20th-century art and continue to inspire a new generation of artists.

              "  'Christian Marclay (born January 11, 1955) is a visual artist and composer. He holds both American and Swiss nationality.\\nMarclay\\'s work explores connections between sound, noise, photography, video and film. A pioneer of using gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages, Marclay is, in the words of critic Thom Jurek, perhaps the \"unwitting inventor of turntablism.\" His own use of turntables and records, beginning in the late 1970s, was developed independently of but roughly parallel to hip hop\\'s use of the instrument.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nChristian Marclay was born on January 11, 1955, in San Rafael, Marin County, California, to a Swiss father and an American mother and raised in Geneva, Switzerland. He studied at the Ecole Supérieure d\\'Art Visuel in Geneva (1975–1977), the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston (1977–1980, Bachelor of Fine Arts) in the Studio for Interrelated Media Program, and the Cooper Union in New York (1978). As a student he was notably interested in Joseph Beuys and the Fluxus movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Long based in Manhattan, Marclay has in recent years divided his time between New York and London.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nCiting the influence of John Cage, Yoko Ono and Vito Acconci, Marclay has long explored the rituals around making and collecting music. Drawn to the energy of punk rock, he began creating songs, singing to music on pre-recorded backing tapes. Unable to recruit a drummer for his 1979 performances with guitarist Kurt Henry, Marclay used the regular rhythms of a skipping LP record as a percussion instrument. These duos with Henry might be the first time a musician used records and turntables as interactive, improvising musical instruments.\\nMarclay sometimes manipulates or damages records to produce continuous loops and skips, and has said he generally prefers inexpensive used records purchased at thrift shops, as opposed to other turntablists who often seek out specific recordings. In 1998, he claimed never to have paid more than US$1 for a record. Marclay has occasionally cut and re-joined different LP records; when played on a turntable, these re-assembled records will combine snippets of different music in quick succession along with clicks or pops from the seams – typical of noise music – and when the original LPs were made of differently-colored vinyl, the reassembled LPs can themselves be considered as works of art.\\nSome of Marclay\\'s musical pieces are carefully recorded and edited plunderphonics-style; he is also active in free improvisation. He was filmed performing a duo with Erikm for the documentary Scratch. His scene didn\\'t make the final cut, but is included among the DVD extras.\\nMarclay released Record Without a Cover on Recycled Records in 1985, \"...designed to be sold without a jacket, not even a sleeve!\" Accumulating dust and fingerprints would enhance the sound. A review in Spin at the time cited Marclay\\'s \"coolest theatrical gesture\" in his live performances of phonoguitar: the artist strapped a record player onto himself and played, for example, a Jimi Hendrix album. In his artwork Five Cubes (1989), he melted vinyl records into cubes. The Sound of Silence (1988) is a black-and-white photograph of the Simon & Garfunkel single of the same title.\\nFollowing this turn, Marclay has in more recent years produced visual art, although usually of representations of sound, or the various technologies of representing sound. His Graffiti Composition (2002) posted musical notes on walls around Berlin, compiled photographs of them as they faded, and is performed in concert. During his residency at Eyebeam, Marclay created Screen Play (2005), a twenty minute video of black and white images overlaid with colorful computer graphics. For Performa 05, the first edition of the Performa Biennial, two ensembles and one soloist interpreted Screen Play.\\nShuffle (2007) and Ephemera (2009) are also musical scores. In Sound Holes (2007), he photographed the many patterns of speaker holes on intercoms. From 2007-2009 he worked with cyanotype at Graphicstudio to capture the motion of cassette tapes unspooling. And an interest in onomatopoeia dating back to 1989 has culminated in his monumental Manga Scroll (2010), a 60-foot scroll of cartoon interjections that doubles as a musical score.\\nIn 2010, he produced The Clock, a 24-hour compilation of time-related scenes from movies that debuted at London\\'s White Cube gallery in 2010. In 2016, he produced Made to Be Destroyed, a compilation of film clips showing the destruction of art works or buildings.\\nThom Jurek writes: \"While many intellectuals have made wild pronouncements about Marclay and his art – and it is art, make no mistake – writing all sorts of blather about how he strips the adult century bare by his cutting up of vinyl records and pasting them together with parts from other vinyl records, they never seem to mention that these sound collages of his are charming, very human, and quite often intentionally hilarious.\"\\nMarclay has performed and recorded both solo and in collaboration with many musicians, including John Zorn, William Hooker, Elliott Sharp, Otomo Yoshihide, Butch Morris, Shelley Hirsch, Flo Kaufmann and Crevice; he has also performed with the group Sonic Youth, and in other projects with Sonic Youth\\'s members.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nSwiss Institute Contemporary Art New York, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2016)\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nMarclay began dating curator Lydia Yee in 1991, and the couple married in 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nAt the 2011 Venice Biennale, representing the United States of America, Marclay was recognized as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for The Clock. Newsweek responded by naming Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today. Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked Andy Warhol, thanking the jury \"for giving The Clock its fifteen minutes\". In 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Berlin Mix the 17th best work of performance art in history.\\nIn 2015, the White Cube presented a major solo exhibition including a range of new work and a lively programme of weekly performances played by the London Sinfonietta and guests, including Thurston Moore and Mica Levi.\\n\\n\\n== Artist books ==\\nEphemera, Bruxelles, mfc-michèle didier, 2009.

              "  'Ronald \"Ron\" Davis (born 1937) is an American painter whose work is associated with geometric abstraction, abstract illusionism, lyrical abstraction, hard-edge painting, shaped canvas painting, color field painting, and 3D computer graphics. He is a veteran of nearly seventy solo exhibitions and hundreds of group exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nBorn in Santa Monica, California, he was raised in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1955–56 he attended the University of Wyoming. In 1959 at the age of 22 he became interested in painting. In 1960–64 he attended the San Francisco Art Institute. Abstract expressionism, the prevailing artistic movement of the time, would have an influence on many of his future works.  In 1962 he was a Yale-Norfolk Summer School Grantee. In 1963 his paintings became hard-edged, geometric and optical in style, and by 1964 his works were shown in important museums and galleries. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, 1965–71, and in Malibu, California, 1972–90. Since 1991 he has lived and worked in Arroyo Hondo on the outskirts of Taos, New Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nRonald Davis from the earliest days of his career had a significant impact on contemporary abstract painting of the mid-1960s. According to art critic Michael Fried:\\n\\nRon Davis is a young California artist whose new paintings, recently shown at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York, are among the most significant produced anywhere during the past few years, and place him, along with Stella and Bannard, at the forefront of his generation. \\nHe had his first one-person exhibition at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles in 1965.\\nBarbara Rose wrote an in depth essay about Davis\\' paintings of the 1960s in the catalogue accompanying an exhibition of his Dodecagon Series in 1989 in Los Angeles. Among other observations she wrote:\\n\\nDavis saw a way to use Duchamp\\'s perspective studies and transparent plane in The Large Glass for pictorial purposes. Instead of glass, he used fiberglass to create a surface that was equally transparent and detached from any illusion of reality. Because his colored pigments are mixed into a fluid resin and harden quickly, multiple layers of color may be applied without becoming muddy. his is essentially an inversion of Old Master layering and glazing except that color is applied behind rather than on top of the surface.\\nAlone among his contemporaries, Davis was equally concerned with traditional problems of painting: space, scale, detail, color relationships and illusions as he was with the California emphasis on hi-tech craft and industrial materials. How to reconcile the literal object produced with the latest technology with transcendental metaphor became the problem that occupied throughout the Sixties. \\nIn an Artforum article in 1970 artist/art critic Walter Darby Bannard commented: \"Though Davis is plagued by \\'series\\' ideas, and has yet to get a grip on the inherent monumentality of his style, he is young and inspired, and these things will evolve naturally.\" From 1966 to 1972, Ron Davis created geometric shaped, illusionistic paintings using polyester resins and fiberglass. About Davis\\' paintings of the late 1960s in an essay accompanying the Ronald Davis retrospective exhibition Forty Years of Abstraction, at the Butler Institute of American Art in 2002, the abstract painter Ronnie Landfield wrote: \"the Dodecagons from 1968–69 remain among the most visually stunning, audacious and intellectually interesting bodies of work made by an abstract painter in the last half of the twentieth century.\"\\nIn 1966 Davis was an instructor at the University of California, Irvine. Also in that year he had his first one-man exhibition at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York City and a solo exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery in 1968.\\nHis works are held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Tate Gallery, London, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago and he has been awarded a National Endowment for the Arts grant. Since the 1990s, he has worked in digital painting and digital art.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDigital art\\nDigital painting\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Citations ===\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\nAlley, Ronald (1981). \"Ronald Davis\".

              "  'Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (born 30 June 1965) is a French visual artist and educator. She is known for her work in video projection, photography, and art installations. She has worked in landscaping, design, and writing. \"I always look for experimental processes. I like the fact that at the beginning I don\\'t know how to do things and then, slowly, I start learning. Often exhibitions don\\'t give me this learning possibility anymore.\"\\nShe lives and works in Paris and Rio de Janeiro.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nDominique Gonzalez-Foerster was born in Strasbourg, France in 1965. At the age of 17, she worked as a museum guard in Grenoble while studying at the École du Magasin of the National Centre of Contemporary Art in Grenoble. She also studied at the Institute des Hautes Études en Arts Plastiques, in Paris. She began her career as an artist in the 1990s, working primarily in film.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nInspired by film, literature, modernist architecture, and art history, her work is often characterized by a quiet, intimate interrogation of contemporary urban life. Often she will use fragments from her international travels in her work and reassembles them into something new. \"My approach to art is quite radical. It has more to do with theater and staging than making objects such as paintings or sculptures. Sometimes I think that the fetishism of objects is pathetic. It\\'s one way to deal with art, but I\\'m obsessed with other things\". She also hopes that her installations will encourage people to interact with them. \"I want to coax people to engage with my art, in the same way that a writer might entice people to read a book\".\\n\\nHer early work was mainly short, minimalistic and oneiric films. She now collaborates on everything from the writing of a science fiction novel with fellow artist Philippe Parreno to working with rock singer Alain Bashung on set design. In 2008 she worked with designer M&M to realize the typeface of \"Expodrome\" a large time-based luminous public art work on the rooftop of a building in Geneva. In 2009, she collaborated with composer Ari Benjamin Meyers on “K62”, a performance shown at Performa 09, New York’s biennial festival of performing arts. She has also collaborated with Nicolas Ghesquière on designing displays for Balenciaga boutiques in New York and Paris. She has even designed a house for a collector in Tokyo.\\nFor the season 2015–2016 in the Vienna State Opera Gonzalez-Foerster designed a large-scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHer first solo exhibition in New York City, \"Equinimod and Costumes\" was held in 2014 at 303 Gallery and featured an art installation of her wardrobe. González-Foerster has had solo exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou, the Dia Art Foundation, the Kunsthalle Zürich, the Musée d\\'Art Moderne de Paris, the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and the Tate Modern.\\nShe participated in the 2006 São Paulo Art Biennial, and the 2009 Venice Biennale.\\n\\n\\n=== Tate Modern\\'s Turbine Hall installation ===\\nThe show was entitled \"The Unilever Series: Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster: TH.2058\" and appeared in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern in Londonhttps from October 14, 2008 to April 13, 2009. At the opening of the show Dominique said, \" Some months ago, I used to wake up in the silence of the night to think about what I was going to do. But not anymore. People ask me, \\'Are you scared?\\' No, I am not scared. If I was, I wouldn\\'t do it. Rather, I\\'m excited. I am putting one third of my energy into just staying calm. The work is on such a scale that if you got too excited, you would explode,\". The show was her first public commission in the UK and filled half of the 3,400 square meter hall. \"TH.2058 by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, imagines Tate Modern 50 years into the future, set in a London afflicted by perpetual rain. Tate Modern is being used as a shelter for people, a storage space for art works and for the remains of culture. The vast Turbine Hall is filled with monumental replicas of iconic sculptural works. Rows of bunk beds are scattered with books, and on a giant screen The Last Film is continuously running. Made up of short excerpts from science-fiction films, The Last Film suggests a potential state of catastrophe as well as the possibility of collective memory,\".\\n\\n\\n=== Hispanic Society of America installation ===\\nThe installation at the Hispanic Society of America in New York was installed in 2009, and was entitled \"chronotopes & dioramas\". The Hispanic Society of America is a museum and research library with an impressive collection of paintings, decorative objects, books, documents, prints, and photographs. However, Dominique discovered it only had a limited supply of 20th century literature and wanted to fill in the gaps. She enlisted help from experts at the American Museum of Natural History. The project involved crafting three habitats in which volumes by nearly 40 authors replaced taxidermied fauna. One evokes water and verticality; another, aridity and flatness; the third, trailing vines. They represent three zones: North America, the Desert, and the Tropics. Aside from the books, each diorama contains a single, mute trace of human presence. In the underwater ocean scene there is an oil barrel. In the desert scene there are ruins of a concrete bunker. In the tropical scene there is a desolate, glass house. They each show the wear and tear of passing time. Many of the books in the dioramas are about anxiety and exile. She also created a mural-sized calligram (an arrangement of words that creates a related visual image). This is Mikhail Bakhtin\\'s concept of the chronotope; \"functioning as the primary means for materializing time in space with the novel\". The installation is housed in an annex to the library.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nGonzalez-Foerster\\'s work is in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Dia Art Foundation, the Guggenheim, the Louis Vuitton Foundation, the M+ Museum, the Moderna Museet, and the Tate Modern.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nGonzalez-Foerster was the recipient of an artist residency in Villa Kujoyama, Kyoto in 1996, the Mies van der Rohe Award in Krefeld in 1996, and the 2002 Marcel Duchamp Prize in Paris.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\"Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster: Public-Personal Space.\" by Graham Coulter-Smith\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nimages of Gonzalez-Foerster\\'s work at Galerie Jan Mot\\nexamples of Gonzalez-Foerster\\'s films at Anna Sanders Films',\n",
              "  'Elizabeth Joy Peyton (born 1965) is an American contemporary artist working primarily in painting, drawing, and printmaking. Best known for figures from her own life and those beyond it, including close friends, historical personae, and icons of contemporary culture, Peyton\\'s portraits have regularly featured artists, writers, musicians, and actors.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Danbury, Connecticut in 1965 as the youngest of five children, Peyton began drawing and painting people at a young age. Between 1984 and 1987, she studied fine arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nPeyton\\'s artwork, mainly figurative, can be characterized by a coupling of understatement and intensity, depicting subjects from her own life and beyond with both startling immediacy and her signature richly modulated surfaces. Peyton draws much inspiration from the creative work of historical figures like Gustave Flaubert and John Singer Sargent, and she has expressed that she is part of a lineage of artists and writers like Balzac, Camille Claudel, Delacroix, Isa Genzken, Giorgione, Georgia O\\'Keeffe, etc. who look at subjects and portray them with an economy of expression to unite passive sensation with emotion.\\nPeyton works from both life and photography, generally using painting, drawing, or printmaking, and often exploring successive degrees of removal from her source material, such as in her paintings of Camille Claudel\\'s sculptures in which Peyton creates paintings of photographs of sculptures. In her interview with Frieze magazine, Peyton expressed that when she chooses to paint from another artist\\'s work, it allows her to explore \"harder-to-reach things inside herself\" because the composition is already decided. In another manner of reworking, Peyton will revisit an image that she has previously used, cropping it in different dimensions and thus altering the amount of context given. This manipulation of context is significant to Peyton because of its effect on the feelings of proximity and intimacy.\\nSince 1998, when Parkett magazine commissioned her to create a lithograph, Peyton has created a broad range of prints, including monotypes, lithographs, and woodcuts. Experimenting with different techniques, she also uses a variety of diverse and handmade papers as well as various colored and monochromatic inks.\\nIn addition to portraits, Peyton also produces work that engages with the still-life tradition, often featuring cropped portraits in complex compositions with flowers, statuary, and other motifs associated with the genre. This exploration, beginning around 2007, represented a reorientation of attention from the figure to the broader context of the individual\\'s environment and the expression of feelings. Examples featured in Peyton\\'s 2017 Dark Incandescence monograph include Pati (2007), Balzac + Roses (2008), Flaubert + Madame Bovary (Elephants) (2008), Camille Claudel and Flowers (Still Life) (2009), Actaeon, Justin Bieber and Grey Roses (2010), Flowers, Lichtenstein, Parsifal (2011), Berlin, Hyacinth and Black Teapot (2014), and Universe of the World-Breath (2018).\\nIn 2009, Peyton collaborated with Matthew Barney on Blood of Two, an art project on the Greek island of Hydra. She later worked with Jonathan Horowitz on a series of monotypes which develop upon the concepts of plants and flowers as motifs of love and death, resulting in a series of paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and photographs, as well as a collaborative artists book.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nOne of Peyton\\'s first exhibitions in New York City was held in a room of the Hotel Chelsea (mainly drawings) in 1993. People who wished to see the exhibition would ask the hotel reception for the key to Room 828; Calvin Tompkins speculated that about 50 people visited Peyton\\'s drawings of Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and other portraits of European historical figures, but this show succeeded in bringing her into the public eye.\\nA mid-career exhibition of her work started at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City in October 2008, and traveled to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht (2009–10). This first survey of Peyton\\'s work in an American institution included her latest portraits, which revealed a greater emphasis on the psychology of subjects such as Matthew Barney and John Giorno. The day following Barack Obama\\'s election to the U.S. presidency, a new painting, created in August 2008, was added to the exhibition, representing Michelle Obama and her daughter at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\\nHer work has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London (2002); Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg, Austria (2002); Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany; Irish Museum of Modern Art (2009); Guild Hall, Easthampton, New York (2006); Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut (2008); Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, where Ghost: Elizabeth Peyton, a retrospective of the artist\\'s prints, was presented concurrently with the same exhibition at the Opelvillen in Rüsselsheim, Germany (2011); Metropolitan Opera, New York (2011 and 2016).

              "  'Mouna Rebeiz (born 1957) is a Lebanese-Canadian contemporary artist invited to exhibit at the 59th Venice Biennale held in 2022. Rebeiz lives and works in London.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nRebeiz was born in Lebanon and educated in Paris. For a brief time she studied psychology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Rebeiz\\'s art education began when she met a lecturer on 18th century painting at the Louvre named Alix de la Source. De la Source taught her the techniques of the old masters. She perfected her patina studies under Abraham Pincas at the Beaux-Arts in Paris and with El Rawas at the Fine Arts School in Beirut.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nRebeiz\\'s work mixes the traditional techniques of \\'Old Masters\\' with contemporary issues and exploration of the human being and its psyche. It is said that her works incorporate both male and female and the West and the East. Steeped in influences from both Lebanon and France, Rebeiz\\'s work explores how both cultures emphasize the duality in the role of women.\\nIn 2015, Rebeiz rose to acclaim when she organized an exhibition and auction at the Saatchi Gallery in London  called \"Le Trebouche.\" The exhibition was based on Rebeiz\\'s ongoing work of taking the Fez, a traditional Middle-Eastern symbol of male virility, and reconstructing it into various commentary on the female form.          \\nFor the exhibition, Rebeiz invited several artists and designers to reinvent their own versions of the Fez, with the  pieces to be held for auction after the close of the exhibition. The auction was held at Sotheby\\'s with proceeds from the auction and the sales of Rebeiz\\'s paintings provided to the charity \"Innocence in Danger,\" a movement for the protection of children against sexual abuse.  Participating designers included Sandra Choi of Jimmy Choo, Elie Saab, Lanvin, Twiggy, Giles Deacon, Helen McCrory, Angel Chang, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Alber Elbaz, Nathalie Rykiel, Stephen Webster, Zaha Hadid, and others.\\n\\n\\n=== Exhibition at the Venice Biennale ===\\nFor the 59th Venice Biennale, held in 2022, Rebeiz presented \"The Soothsayer\" based on the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot of Marseille, reinterpreted into paintings on aluminum plates.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website',\n",
              "  'Robert H. Colescott (August 26, 1925 – June 4, 2009) was an American painter. He is known for satirical genre and crowd subjects, often conveying his exuberant, comical, or bitter reflections on being African American. He studied with Fernand Léger in Paris. Colescott\\'s work is in many major public collections, including (in addition to the Albright-Knox) those of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBorn in Oakland, California, in 1925. His mother was a pianist and his father was an accomplished classical and jazz violinist. Colescott developed a deep love of music early on and played instruments as a child & took up drumming at an early age and seriously considered pursuing a career as a musician before settling instead on art. The sculptor Sargent Claude Johnson was a family friend who was a role model to Colescott growing up, and was also a connection to the Harlem Renaissance and artwork dealing with African-American experience. In 1940, Colescott watched as the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera painted a mural at the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island near San Francisco. Colescott went on to absorb the Western art historical canon and to explore the art of Africa and New Guinea. He would always be acutely aware what was going on in the contemporary art world. Nonetheless, these early experiences remained touchstones.\\nAs a budding artist, Colescott was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942 and served in Europe until the end of World War II. His tour of duty took him to Paris, then the capital of the art world and a city that was hospitable to African American artists. Back home, he enrolled at UC Berkeley, which granted him a bachelor\\'s degree in drawing and painting in 1949. He spent the following year in Paris, studying with French artist Fernand Léger, then returned to UC Berkeley, earning a master\\'s degree in 1952.\\n\\n\\n=== Artistic career ===\\n\\n\\n==== Early career ====\\nIt was in Portland that Colescott\\'s professional career as an artist was firmly established, thanks in large part to patron of the arts and philanthropist Arlene Schnitzer, owner and director of the Fountain Gallery, which she opened to promote contemporary artists from the region. Colescott\\'s work was included in the gallery\\'s inaugural exhibition in 1961, and he was given his first solo show there in 1963. In a tragic incident in 1977, a fire destroyed the gallery, and many of Colescott\\'s works burned along with the works of many other artists represented by the gallery. The gallery, which reopened after the fire in a new location, continued to represent Colescott\\'s work until it closed its doors in 1986.\\n\\n\\n==== Sojourns in Egypt (1964–67) ====\\nColescott\\'s sojourns in Egypt, and his encounter with Egyptian art and culture and the continent of Africa, were life-changing experiences. The impact on the trajectory of the rest of his artistic career, in terms of both its formal qualities and subject matter, was first manifest in the series of paintings \"The Valley of the Queens\", inspired by a visit to Thebes. \"Three thousand years or non-European art, a strong narrative tradition, formal qualities such as the fluidity of the graphic line, monumentality of scale, vivid color and sense of pattern--all these elements had profound, immediate, and lasting impact on his work.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Putting Black people into art history ====\\n\\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Colescott began creating works based on iconic paintings from art history.  His Olympia, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, reimagines Manet\\'s Olympia with the Black servant as an equal.  Colescott\\'s George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware: Page From an American History Textbook (1975), based on Emanuel Leutze\\'s 1851 painting of the Revolutionary War hero, putting Carver, a pioneering African American agricultural chemist, at the helm of a boat loaded with Black cooks, maids, fishermen and minstrels.  With equally transgressive humor and an explosive style, he also created his own versions of Vincent van Gogh\\'s Potato Eaters (1975), Jan van Eyck\\'s Arnolfini Portrait (1976), and Édouard Manet\\'s Dejeuner sur l\\'Herbe (1980).\\n\\n\\n==== First retrospective ====\\nIn 1987, the San Jose Museum of Art organized the first major retrospective of Colescott\\'s work. Museum director John Olbrantz curated the exhibition. After its presentation in San Jose, the exhibition traveled under the auspices of the Art Museum Association of America to the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, the Baltimore Museum of Art, Portland Art Museum (Oregon), Akron Art Museum, Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, University of Oklahoma, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, the New Museum in New York City, and the Seattle Art Museum. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalog entitled  Robert Colescott: A Retrospective, 1975-1986, with an essay by Lowery Stokes Sims, a longtime champion of Colescott\\'s work, and a republication of the essay \"Robert Colescott: Pride and Prejudice\" by Mitchell D. Kahan.\\n\\n\\n==== Venice Biennale ====\\n\\nIn 1997 Colescott was catapulted into the international limelight when he was selected to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale. According to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Colescott was \"the first African-American artist to represent the United States in a solo exhibition at the Venice Biennale in 1997.\" The only previous African-American artist to represent the United States at the Biennale was Sam Gilliam, who had participated in a group show representing the United States in 1972. The exhibition was organized by U.S. Commissioner Miriam Roberts, an independent curator. Following its presentation in the United States Pavilion in Venice (June 15 - November 9, 1997), the exhibition embarked on a three-year tour of museums that included the Walker Art Center, the Queens Museum of Art, University of Arizona Museum of Art, Portland Art Museum (Oregon), University of California Berkeley Art Museum, University of Nebraska Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery and Sculpture Garden, now known as the Sheldon Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Center (New Orleans), and the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House (formerly The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu).\\nThe exhibition catalog includes essays by Roberts and Lowery Stokes Sims, a poem by Quincy Troupe, and a photo essay by artist Carrie Mae Weems, to honor Colescott\\'s influence on a younger generation artists in general and African-American artists in particular. According to his obituary by Roberta Smith: \"While Mr. Colescott’s work was overtly political and multicultural, it was often at odds with the academic earnestness of such approaches. In his disregard for simplistic dualities regarding race and sex, he helped set the stage for transgressive work by painters like Ellen Gallagher, Kerry James Marshall, Sue Williams and Carroll Dunham and multimedia artists like Kara Walker, William Pope.L, and Kalup Linzy.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching career ===\\nLike many artists of his generation, Colescott maintained parallel careers as a committed and influential educator and painter. He moved to the Pacific Northwest after graduation from UC Berkeley and began teaching at Portland State University. He was on staff there from 1957 to 1966. In 1964 he took a sabbatical with a study grant from the American Research Center in Cairo, Egypt. He returned to Portland for a year but went back to Egypt as a visiting professor at the American University of Cairo from 1966 to 1967. When war broke out, he and his family (then-wife Sally Dennett and their son Dennett Colescott, born in Portland, Oregon in 1963) moved to Paris for three years. They returned to California in 1970 and he spent the next 15 years painting and teaching art at Cal State, Stanislaus, UC Berkeley and the San Francisco Art Institute. Colescott accepted a position as a visiting professor at the University of Arizona in Tucson in 1983, and joined the faculty in 1985. In 1990 he became the first art department faculty member to be honored with the title of Regents\\' Professor.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nColescott died June 4, 2009, in Tucson, Arizona.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nOn June 30, 2022, the New Museum in New York opened \"Art and Race Matters: The Career of Robert Colescott,\" the first Manhattan retrospective of the artist\\'s career in more than three decades. Venus Over Manhattan then showcased an exhibition titled \"Robert Colescott: Women,\" which examined the artist\\'s depiction of women throughout his career, featuring around thirty artworks made between 1955 and 1996.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nColescott had an older brother, Warrington Colescott Jr., of Hollandale, Wisconsin. He was also the father to five sons: Alex, Nick, Dennett, Daniel and Cooper. During his time he was also married five separate times.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBerkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nRobert Colescott: A Retrospective.

              "  'Francis Alÿs (born 1959, Antwerp) is a Belgian-born, Mexico-based artist.\\nHis work emerges in the interdisciplinary space of art, architecture, and social practice. In 1986, Alÿs left behind his profession as an architect and relocated to Mexico City, where he lives and works.\\nHe has created a diverse body of artwork and performance art that explores urban tensions and geopolitics. Employing a broad range of media, from painting to performance, his works examine the tension between politics and poetics, individual action and impotence. Alÿs commonly enacts paseos—walks that resist the subjection of common space.\\nCyclical repetition and mechanics of progression and regression also inform the character of Alÿs\\' actions and mythology—Alÿs contrasts geological and technological time through land-based and social practice that examine individual memory and collective mythology. Alÿs frequently engages rumor as a central tool in his practice, disseminating ephemeral, practice-based works through word-of-mouth and storytelling. He has documented children\\'s games for decades.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nAlÿs\\' body of works encompasses many media. Whereas in the earlier years the actions were mostly performed by the artist himself, over the past decade children have become the main protagonists of his projects. These public actions are documented in video, installations, paintings, and drawings. Throughout his practice, Francis Alÿs consistently directs his distinct poetic and imaginative sensibility toward anthropological and geopolitical concerns centered around observations of, and engagements with, everyday life, which the artist himself has described as \"a sort of discursive argument composed of episodes, metaphors, or parables.\"\\n\\n\\n== Actions ==\\nMany of his works involve intense observation and recording of the social, cultural and economic fabric of specific locations, commonly taking place during walks through urban areas. Citing the act of walking as the centre of his practice, for his first performance The Collector (1991), he dragged a small magnetic toy dog on wheels throughout the streets of Mexico City so as to collect any metallic residue lying in its path. In Fairy Tales (1995), he takes a walk after unravelling the sweater he has on, leaving an ever-lengthening, blue-thread trail in his wake. Also in 1995, Alÿs realized an action in São Paulo called The Leak in which he walked from a gallery, around the city, and back into the gallery trailing a dribbled line from an open can of blue paint. This action was reprised in 2004 when Alÿs traced a line of paint following the 1948 cease-fire border in Jerusalem, known as \\'the green line\\', carrying a can filled with green paint. The bottom of the can was perforated with a small hole, so the paint dripped out as a continuous squiggly line on the ground as he walked. The work Paradox of Praxis 1 (Sometimes Making Something Leads to Nothing) documents an action performed on the streets of Mexico City in 1997. The film depicts a simple and seemingly pointless endeavour—a large block of ice being pushed through the city streets for nine hours until it melts away to a puddle of meltwater.\\nThe Rehearsal (1999) consists of a 30 min static take of a red VW Beetle driving up the slope of a dirt road in a shantytown of Tijuana while the viewer hears musicians rehearsing a song. Every time they stop playing, the car rolls backwards down the hill, as if running out of petrol, but when the music starts up again, the car starts driving up the hill once more.\\nIn Tornado (2000-2010), spliced film clips show Alÿs chasing after huge dust devils kicked up by the annual dry season in central Mexico. Kara L. Rooney writes of the piece in The Brooklyn Rail, \"The sight of his lean frame racing towards the twisters is at once ridiculous and hysterical—blithe qualities that quickly give way to gravitas as the artist physically enters the eye of the storm. Inside, chaos reigns and Alÿs, unprotected except for his handheld camera, is enveloped and pummeled by flying bits of sand, dust and dirt.\"\\nIn his best-known work, When Faith Moves Mountains (2002), Alÿs recruited 500 volunteers in Ventanilla District outside of Lima, Peru. The participants were equipped with shovels and, forming a single line, they moved their shovel full of sand one step at a time from one side of a dune to the other, and together they displaced by a few inches the 500 mt long sand dune from its original position. Art critic Jean Fisher writes that \"the radical event of art precipitates a crisis of meaning or, rather, it exposes the void of meaning at the core of a given social situation, which is its truth.\"\\nBetween 2004 and 2005 Alÿs collaborated with Artangel on several projects regrouped under the title of Seven Walks. In one of them, The Nightwatch (2004), a wild fox called Bandit was set free in the National Portrait Gallery while its wanderings were filmed by the surveillance cameras of the museum.\\nFor Performa 05, Alys created Ensayo II(2005) in collaboration with Rafael Ortega. The performance juxtaposed a rare mix of high and low in a staged performance featuring a striptease artist (Bella Yao), a classical pianist (Alexander Rovang), and a soprano (Viktoria Kurbatskaya). \\nIn the project Don\\'t Cross the Bridge Before You Get to the River (2008), a line of kids with shoe boats leaves Europe towards Morocco while a line of kids with shoe boats leaves Africa towards Spain, with the 2 lines eventually meeting on the horizon. As in many of Alÿs\\' video projects, his collaborators were Rafael Ortega, Julien Devaux, Felix Blume and Ivan Boccara.\\nFor Manifesta 10 in St. Petersburg, Alÿs contributed with Lada Kopeika Project (2014), a \"road trip\" that concludes with the Lada car crashing into a tree in the courtyard of the Hermitage. The Silence of Ani was realized in 2015 with a group of teenagers of Kars, Turkey. It takes place on the present Turkish-Armenian border in the once Armenian City of Ani which, after centuries of successive invasions and sackings, lies today in a state of total abandon and decay. Alÿs gave instruments to imitate birds—birdcalls—to the teenagers, they entered the city walls and, hiding in the rubbles, called the birds to create the illusion that the city was coming back to life.\\n\\n\\n== Painting ==\\n\"I was profoundly under the spell of pre-Renaissance painting during my years of university in Italy: from Lorenzetti to Fra Angelico. Even to this day, my iconography is a combination of that imagery and the language of Mexican sign painting. This blend allowed me to find a personal way of materializing images. I\\'ve never been that interested in a painterly style. My images are most often mentally resolved— \\'imagined\\'—by the time they make it to the canvas.\"In the early nineties, Alÿs collaborated with Mexican sign-painters (\"rotulistas\") to paint enlarged and elaborated versions of his small paintings, which they were invited to reproduce at their own taste. The generic name of this project was The Liar, the Copy of the Liar (1997). His intention is to challenge the idea of the original artwork, rendering the process of making more anonymous and deflating the perceived commercial value of art.\\nThe paintings of the series Le temps du sommeil were begun in 1996 and often worked on at night. They feature visionary dreamlike scenes involving tiny suited men and women acting out strange rituals reminiscent of children\\'s games and gymnastic experiments. Many of these images anticipate and recall the forms he has employed in his actions, but the paintings connect to his actions in other ways too since their surfaces are worked and re-worked. The fact that the images are never final but rather are palimpsests, suggests the deep connection between figurative painting and action art that lies at the heart of Alÿs\\' work.\\n\"What justifies my recourse to painting is that it\\'s the shortest way—or sometimes the only way—to translate certain scenarios or situations that cannot be said, that cannot be filmed or performed. It\\'s about entering a situation that could not exist elsewhere, only on the paper or canvas. [...] Also, painting allows me to retreat from the sometimes hectic rhythm of the performances and film productions, and to distance myself without losing contact with them. [...] When I am translating an ongoing film plot into an image, I\\'ll try to create an image that reflects the intention behind the plot rather than illustrating the facts of the film. It functions more like a correspondence, a pendant.\"\\n\\n\\n== The Fabiola Project ==\\nSince 1994, Alÿs has been collecting copies of Jean-Jacques Henner\\'s painting of Fabiola, a fourth-century patrician Roman woman who, despite divorce and remarriage, did such fervent penance that she was welcomed back to the faith and, after her death, sainted. Through a novel written by Cardinal Wiseman, Fabiola regained popularity in the middle of the nineteen century. Alÿs acquired copies of Fabiola portraits painted by amateurs in flea markets and antiques stores, in places as various as Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Holland, Germany, Lebanon and Russia. The paintings have been left in their original state. The artists, dates, and places of origin are often unknown.\\nAlÿs explained his interest in these widely produced replicas: \\'It made me question the status of an icon. What is an icon? Is an icon defined by official art history? Or is an icon defined by, in this case, what seems to be an amateur painter\\'s obsession with a particular image?\\'\\n24 Fabiolas were first exhibited in 1994 at the Mexico City\\'s cultural initiative Curare: espacio crítico para las artes. In 1997, 60 of them were exhibited at London\\'s Whitechapel Art Gallery. Between 2007 and 2018 they were exhibited at the following venues: Dia Art Foundation at The Hispanic Society of America, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); National Portrait Gallery, London; Monasterio de Santo Domingo de Silos, Burgos, Spain (organized by Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid); Haus sum Kirschgarten, Basel (organized by Schaulager); Museo de Arte de Lima; Museo Amparo, Puebla, Mexico; Pinacoteca do Estado de Sao Paulo; Museo de Arte de Zapopan, Guadalajara, Mexico. Its latest presentation was at the Byzantine Fresco Chapel of the Menil Collection in Houston and by then the collection had grown to include 514 copies of the original portrait.\\n\\n\\n== Recent projects ==\\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Alÿs traveled extensively to Afghanistan following his invitation to participate in dOCUMENTA(13). In collaboration with Julien Devaux and Ajmal Maiwandi, he produced Reel-Unreel (2011), a 20 min film. The camera follows two young Afghan boys as they chase the reel rolling down the hills of Kabul, with one boy unrolling the strip of film and leading the way, while another follows him, rewinding it. The title Reel-Unreel alludes to the real/unreal image of Afghanistan conveyed by the media in the West: how the Afghan way of life, along with its people, has gradually been dehumanized and, after decades of war, turned into a Western fiction. In 2013, he was an embedded war artist with the UK\\'s Task Force in the province of Helmand (Adrenalotourism, 2013).\\nOriginally invited by the Baghdad-based Ruya Foundation to do a project in Yezidi refugee camps, Alÿs\\' main focus of production from 2015 to 2020 took place in Iraq. As a war artist again he accompanied a Peshmerga battalion during the Kurdish offensive to free Mosul from the Islamic state of occupation. In that region Alÿs has also developed projects such as Hopscotch (2016), produced in collaboration with the Yazidi Refugee Camp of Sharya, Duhok, Iraq; Color Matching (2016), filmed during his embed with Kurdish forces; Salam Tristesse (2018) produced in collaboration with the Yazidi Refugee Camp of Kabarto and lastly Sandlines, the Story of History (2020), a feature film where the children of a mountain village near Mosul reenact a century of Iraqi history, from the secret agreement of Sykes/Picot signed in 1916 to the realm of terror established by the Islamic State in 2016. Sandlines premiered in 2020 at festivals like Sundance, the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and Mexico City\\'s FICUNAM.\\nAlÿs continues to add to his long-running film series Children\\'s Games (1999–present) which has amassed over 30 videos of children playing games in places in Afghanistan, Iraq, Mexico, Europe, and Hong Kong. The series reflects the artist\\'s habit of \\'making contact\\' with a different culture by seeing and filming how children play.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and recognition ==\\nThe artist\\'s work was the subject of major surveys like A Story of Deception, which was on view from 2010 to 2011 at Tate Modern, London; Wiels Centre d\\'Art Contemporain, Brussels; and The Museum of Modern Art, New York and MoMA PS1, Long Island City, New York; or A Story of Negotiation, which traveled between 2015 and 2017 from Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, Mexico City, to Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires (MALBA) – Fundación Costantini, Buenos Aires; Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de la Habana, Havana; and Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto.\\n\\n\\n=== Exhibitions (selection) ===\\n\\nOver the past decade, he has had several solo exhibitions, including at the WIELS, Contemporary Art Centre, Brussels (2023-24); Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC), Mexico City (2023); Kuandu Museum of Fine Arts, Taipei (2022); Copenhagen Contemporary (2022); Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts, Lausanne (2021); Museo Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá (2020); the Rockbund Art Museum (RAM), Shanghai (2018); Art Sonje Center, Seoul (2018); Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (traveled to the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, both 2013); Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (2010); The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago (2008); Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2007); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC (2006); and Portikus, Frankfurt (2006). Alÿs participated in the Venice Biennale in 1999, 2001, 2007 and 2017, and the Carnegie International in 2004.In 2022, Alÿs represented Belgium at the 59th Venice Biennale with the solo presentation, Francis Alÿs: The Nature of the Game. In 2024 Alÿs has participated in Manif d’art, the Québec City Biennale and a solo exhibition at the Museo de Arte de Lima (MALI).\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nHe has been awarded the Blue Orange prize in 2004, the Vincent Award in 2008, the BACA-laureate prize in 2010, the EYE Art & Film Prize from EYE Filmmuseum in 2018, in 2020 the Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon Award and the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts, and the Wolfgang Hahn Prize at the Museum Ludwig in 2023. He was among the names in Blake Gopnik\\'s 2011 list \"The 10 Most Important Artists of Today\", with Gopnik arguing that his art stands for \"being alive and striving to do anything in a universe that grinds all efforts to dust.\"\\nIn 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Re-Enactment 10th in his list of the greatest performance art works, saying that it \"seems to carry more personal risk as well heavier social critique [sic]\" than the better-known When Faith Moves Mountains.\\n\\n\\n== Selected bibliography ==\\n2004.

              "  'François Morellet (30 April 1926 – 10 May 2016) was a French contemporary abstract painter, sculptor, and light artist. His early work prefigured minimal art and conceptual art and he played a prominent role in the development of geometrical abstract art and post-conceptual art.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nMorellet began to make still-life paintings at the age of 14 as he studied Russian literature in Paris. After completing his studies, he returned to Cholet in 1948, where he continued to paint, now in the spirit of the COBRA movement. After this short period of figurative/representational work, Morellet turned to abstraction in 1950 after encountering the Concrete art of Max Bill. Morellet then adopted a pictorial language of simple geometric forms: lines, squares and triangles assembled into two-dimensional compositions.  \\nIn 1960, he was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV), with fellow artists Francisco Sobrino, Horatio Garcia-Rossi, Hugo DeMarco, Julio Le Parc, Jean-Pierre Yvaral (the son of Victor Vasarely), Joël Stein, Vera Molnár and François Molnár (the last two left the group shortly after). Morellet began at this time to work with neon tube lighting.\\nFrom the 1960s on, Morellet worked in various materials (fabric, tape, neon, walls...) and in doing so investigated the use of the exhibition space in terms similar to artists of installation art and environmental art.  He gained an international reputation, especially in Germany and France, and he was commissioned to create work for public and private collections in Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S. One of his works is part of the permanent collection of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. In 2016/2017, the CILA staged a retrospective of Morellet\\'s Light Art, the last exhibition to be curated by the artist himself, shortly before his death in May 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nMorellet\\'s abstract ideal was, he said, tempered by the charming nihilism of Marcel Duchamp. For him, a work of art referred only to itself. \\nHis titles are generally sophisticated, show some Duchampian word play, and describe the \"constraints\" or \"rules\" that he used to create them. Like other contemporary artists who use constraints and chance (or the aleatory) in their works, such as John Cage in music and the Oulipo group in literature, Morellet used rules and constraints established in advance to guide the creation of his works while also allowing chance to play a role in some of his compositions. This dialectic between the rigid rule-based procedure and chance situates his work within the Post-conceptual art category.\\nHis rigorous use of geometry tends to create emotionally neutral work, and also placed him close to Minimal art and Conceptual art in his aims. He shared a particular affinity to the American artists Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt.\\n\\nSeries: Répartitions aléatoires (\"Chance divisions\") from the 1950s\\nRépartition de 16 formes identiques - painted after his visit to the Alhambra of Granada\\nSeries: Trames from the 1950s\\nSeries: Désintégrations architecturales (\"Architectural disintegrations\") from 1971\\nSeries: Géométrées from 1983\\nSeries: Défigurations from 1988\\nSeries: Déclinaisons de pi (\"Versions of pi\") from 1998\\n\\n\\tAlbum de 10 sérigraphies sur 10 ans (1952-1961), François Morellet, 1975, Musée Groninger\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nApril 10, 2016, the first François Morellet Prize (awarded to a personality for his writings on art) was awarded to Catherine Millet by Philippe Méaille.

              "  'Gabriel Orozco (born April 27, 1962) is a Mexican artist. He gained his reputation in the early 1990s with his exploration of drawing, photography, sculpture and installation. In 1998, Francesco Bonami called Orozco \"one of the most influential artists of this decade, and probably the next one too.\"\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nOrozco was born in 1962 in Veracruz, Mexico to Cristina Félix Romandía and Mario Orozco Rivera, a mural painter and art professor at the University of Veracruz. When Orozco was six, the family relocated to the San Ángel neighborhood of Mexico City so that his father could work with artist David Alfaro Siquieros on various mural commissions. His father took him along to museum exhibitions and to work with him, during which time Orozco overheard many conversations about art and politics.\\n\\nOrozco attended the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas between 1981 and 1984 but found the program too conservative. In 1986, he moved to Madrid and enrolled at the Circulo de Bellas Artes. There his instructors introduced him to a broad range of post-war artists working in non-traditional formats. He said of his time in Spain,  \"What\\'s important is to be confronted deeply with another culture.  And also to feel that I am the Other, not the resident. That I am the immigrant. I was displaced and in a country where the relationship with Latin America is conflicted. I came from a background that was very progressive. And then to travel to Spain and confront a very conservative society that also wanted to be very avant-garde in the 1980s, but treated me as an immigrant, was shocking. That feeling of vulnerability was really important for developing my work. I think a lot of my work has to do with that kind of exposure, to expose vulnerability and make that your strength.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\nIn 1987, Orozco returned from his studies in Madrid to Mexico City, where he hosted weekly meetings with a group of other artists including Damián Ortega, Gabriel Kuri, Abraham Cruzvillegas and Dr. Lakra. This group met once a week for five years and over time the artist\\'s home became a place where many artistic and cultural projects took shape.\\nOrozco\\'s nomadic way of life began to inform his work strongly around this time, and he took considerable inspiration from exploring the streets. His early practice was intended to break away from the mainstream work of the 1980s, which was often created in huge studios with many assistants and elaborate techniques of production and distribution. In contrast, Orozco typically worked alone or with one or two other assistants. His work revolves around many repeated themes and techniques that incorporate real life and common objects. The exploration of his chosen materials allows the audience\\'s imagination to explore the creative associations between oft-ignored objects in today\\'s world.\\n\\nIn 1995 he worked in Berlin on a Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst grant.\"For him [Orozco], the decentralization of the manufacturing practice mirrors a rich heterogeneity of object and material. There is no way to identify a work by Orozco in terms of physical product. Instead it must be discerned through leitmotifs and strategies that constantly recur, but in always mutating forms and configurations.\" – Ann Temkin\\n\"What is most important is not so much what people see in the gallery or the museum, but what people see after looking at these things, how they confront reality again.\"- Gabriel Orozco from an interview with Benjamin H. D. BuchlohHe is represented in New York by Marian Goodman.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGabriel Orozco married Maria Gutierrez on August 2, 1994, at City Hall in New York. They have one son, Simόn, born in November 2004. Orozco lives and works in New York, Mexico City, Tokyo, and France.\\n\\n\\n== Selection of works ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1981–91 ===\\nRecaptured Nature, 1991\\nRecaptured Nature is one of Orozco\\'s earliest sculptural works and is constructed entirely from the vulcanized rubber made to create the inner tubes of truck tires. Orozco cut the rubber down the middle, then opened it up, cut two circular lid shapes from another inner tube, and welded them together at a tire shop. This resulted in an inflatable ball.  Orozco says the work is an “exercise in topology,” an area of mathematics concerned with the study of continuity and connectivity. Recaptured Nature plays with the idea that everything can become everything else. This piece informed future works like Elevator in which the artist reconstructed an elevator to be exactly his height.\\nSleeping Dog, 1990\\nOrozco began working with photography around 1989. An early photograph, Sleeping Dog, evidences both Orozco\\'s reverence for and his mistrust of the photographic medium. The print immobilizes a sleeping dog from an aerial perspective on a large rock. The perspective of the camera compresses the foreground and background in such a way that the dog becomes at once image and object, possessing weight and presence while simultaneously producing a memory of the event. The overall physical impression that the image produces is suggestive of Orozco\\'s interest in photography as a means to inform sculptural representation.\\nCrazy Tourist, 1991\\nCrazy Tourist was a photograph taken by Orozco in Bahia Brazil. While wandering through the town of Cachoeira, Orozco came upon an empty marketplace. He spied some rotting oranges left over from the closed market and proceeded to position one on each table. Orozco then captured the intervention in a photograph. The locals who were watching him called him a \"turista maluco\". Crazy Tourist exemplifies Orozco\\'s approach to photography. Orozco does not want his photographs to serve as documentation in the way of becoming a relic, but rather as a witness to an ephemeral event that often occurs while the artist is alone. You forget the photograph but see the phenomena.\\nMy Hands are my Heart, 1991\\nMy Hands are my Heart is a small heart-shaped sculptural work made in 1991 by the artist applying pressure with his fingers into a small lump of clay, leaving the impression of his fingers in the shape of a heart. The durable nature of hardened clay contrasts with the soft vulnerability of the object\\'s identification as a human organ.  The impression of the artist\\'s fingers leaves a lingering trace of contact with the artist hands, a meditation on the creative process. My Hands are my Heart also refers to the diptych of photographs taken with the artist, bare-chested, holding the work near his actual heart.\\n\\n\\n=== 1992–99 ===\\nYielding Stone, 1992\\nYielding Stone was one of two works created for a group exhibition in 1992. The work consisted of a solid ball of grey plasticine that was rolled through the streets in Monterrey, collecting dirt, debris and pebbles on its surface. The work was then exhibited in a gallery space where it continued to collect dust and attract foreign objects to its surface, elevating the object to the point of focus. Orozco showed a second version of Yielding Stone in the group exhibition In Transit at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York in 1993. The work displays the process of its creation and embodies the imprints of its interactions.\\nEmpty Shoe Box, 1993\\nFor the 1993 Venice Biennale, Orozco placed an empty shoebox on the floor of the Aperto. The use of the shoebox could at first be thought of simply as a readymade but Orozco\\'s use of this object is meant to instead draw the viewer\\'s attention to his or her surroundings. The placement of such a highly familiar object within an otherwise empty environment allows for more of an awareness of what is and isn\\'t in the space.\\n\"The reasons for the quietly compelling attraction of an utterly banal object are of course manifold, yet one primary explanation could be found in the fact that the presentation of an empty container, rather than the object itself, traces the very shift from use value to exhibition value that has occurred in the culture at large.\" – Benjamin H.D. Buchloh\\nHome Run, 1993\\nHome Run was part of a larger exhibition—Projects 41: Gabriel Orozco—that took place at MoMA in September 1993. The parameters of the exhibition were founded upon experimentation with the spatial limitations of viewing art. For his part, Orozco asked occupants in the buildings adjacent to MoMA to place oranges in their windows, so that the viewer would encounter the exhibition even after leaving the typically defined space of the museum. The placement of the oranges introduced a playful element to the piece as viewers accidentally came upon the work: museum visitors could experience the installation beyond the walls of the institution. In this way Home Run disrupted the traditional notion of the exhibition “viewing space” and blurred the line between art and life.\\nLa DS, 1993\\nLa DS was first exhibited at the Galerie Chantal Crousel in Paris in 1993. In preparation for the exhibition, Orozco traveled to Paris and for nearly two months worked on the reconstruction of a Citroen DS with the aid of his assistant Philippe Picoli. Orozco intentionally used the 1950s classic French automobile due to its status in French popular culture as a symbol of post-World War II ingenuity. The fabrication and presentation of La DS reflects Orozco\\'s interest in the mental and physical aspects of sculptural space and set a precedent for playful viewer-object relationships that Orozco continues to explore in his sculptural works. To create the work, Orozco cut an interior horizontal section from the automobile, and reassembled the remaining two halves so the car maintained its formal qualities. A mirror inserted on the driver\\'s side of the automobile, furthers the illusion of the car still being drivable. The exchange between the physical perception of the object and the memory of how the object should behave in space determines the spectators\\' overall understanding of the work, creating a mental image of the car that has a photographic effect.\\n\"I have been interested in this notion of space that is still there and how a thin line that divides two bodies is not measurable. Of course, physically it is very thin, but emotionally or mentally it is much bigger and is immeasurable. In my work, I think, it is that space which interests me as a sculptor.\" – Gabriel Orozco\\nYogurt Caps, 1994\\nIt is evident from works such as La DS, Home Run, and Empty Shoe Box that Orozco pays great attention to the space in which his viewers will interact with his work. For his first show with Marian Goodman in New York, Orozco placed four yogurt caps onto each opposing wall in the empty northern room of the gallery. Orozco has said a number of times that he aims to “disappoint the viewer.” In other words, his work can sometimes seem underwhelming to those who may have come to the experience with certain expectations. Yogurt Caps challenged the viewer\\'s notion of space, emptiness, self-awareness, and the body.\\n\"It was a poem about nothing, that beautifully, could thus be one about everything too. A presence, however slight, was the key to seeing the emptiness of the room, as just a single sound is needed to manifest silence.\" – Ann Temkin\\nWorking Tables, 1996\\nOrozco\\'s first Working Table was exhibited in Zurich in 1996. The working tables are accumulations of sketches, ideas, found objects, leftovers, and unfinished artworks. The tables offer up an intimate picture of the process of the artist; the conception of an idea, the experimentation, and sometimes the decision to discard a work and its idea entirely.  These small objects, when shown together, give the viewer an understanding of the recurring themes and connections that can be found within Orozco\\'s work.\\nBlack Kites, 1997\\nBlack Kites was conceived for Documenta X shortly after one of Orozco\\'s lungs collapsed in 1996. After a week spent in the hospital, Orozco decided he wanted to make his next work via a \"very slow process.\" He purchased a human skull from a nature store in NYC and for the next few months he worked at covering the entire skull in a checkerboard grid made of graphite. The grid follows the contours of the skull, leading the viewer in a circular pathway around it. There is a relationship formed between the rigidity of a system such as a grid and the naturally created shape of a human skull. Black Kites additionally embodies ideas of the memento mori and the iconographic skulls seen frequently within Mexican culture. The work brings to mind questions of our human fate and mortality.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000–current ===\\nLintels, 2001\\nLintels was created for Orozco\\'s solo show with Marian Goodman in 2001. The installation consists of numerous sheets of dryer lint collected over the course of a year. Orozco installed the sheets in the gallery to hang across the room as if on a clothesline. The fragile sheets are full of hair, dust, nail clippings and particles of clothing. They would sway ever so slightly when viewers walked through the installation. The Lintels are essentially the accumulation of residue left by the human body\\'s presence. The work echoes Orozco\\'s earlier sculpture Yielding Stone as both reflect upon corporeality and ephemerality. Both of the works continue to change within the environment they inhabit as new dust and debris gather on their surface.\\nSamurai Tree Paintings, 2004\\nIn 2004, Orozco began creating geometric abstract paintings. The circular forms and diagrammatic design were similar to those which Orozco had been toying with for years on graph paper, currency, and airplane tickets. He debuted the first paintings at his solo exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London in 2004. Beginning at a single point in space, Orozco used computer software to draw a circle around the point and divide this circle into quadrants. He then drew another circle to touch the outer edge of the previous one (varying the size of the circle) and proceeded to divide those into quadrants. Orozco would then paint the halves and quadrants in red, blue, white, or gold, treating the sections of the circles as if they were squares on a chessboard. Circles play an integral part in Orozco\\'s work and he sees them as instruments of movement. In the Samurai Tree paintings there is a centrifugal point from which the circles spin and rotate outwards.\\nCorplegados, 2011\\nThe Corplegados are a series of large format drawings created for Orozco\\'s most recent show with Marian Goodman in 2011. The word literally translates to mean folded bodies. The works are life-size sheets of paper that Orozco would fold up and take with him on his travels between 2007 and 2011.  Orozco drew, paint and wrote all over the surfaces of the paper. The application and layering of the various media permeated the paper and soaked through to the back side forming an unpredictable, ghostly reflection of the front. The drawings were installed in two-sided glass frames that hung from the wall on hinges so the viewer could see both sides of the paper. Each drawing transitioned from bright, colorful, painterly gestures to linear, geometric shapes and a muted palette. These contrasts reflected the different psychological and environmental changes to which the artist and his drawings were exposed to over extended periods of time.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions (selection) ==\\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a solo show of the artist in 1993 and a mid-career retrospective exhibition in December 2009. The exhibition traveled to the Kunstmuseum Basel, the Centre Pompidou, Paris, and ended at the Tate Modern, London, in May 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections (selection) ==\\nHis work has been included in the permanent collection of several museum institutions such as the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida with the work Samurai Tree (Invariant 260) from 2020–21; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Aspen Art Museum, Colorado; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; San Jose Museum of Art, California; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA); Dallas Museum of Art, Texas; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Pennsylvania; Whitney Museum of American Art; New York; Noguchi Museum, Queens; Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Illinois; Tate, London; Museo Reina Sofia, Spain.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nA list of select publications include:\\n\\n\\n=== Art books ===\\nOrozco, Gabriel; Obrist, Hans Ulrich (2013).

              "  'Yoko Ono (Japanese: 小野 洋子, romanized: Ono Yōko, usually spelled in katakana オノ・ヨーコ; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese multimedia artist, singer, songwriter, and peace activist. Her work also encompasses performance art and filmmaking.\\nOno grew up in Tokyo and moved to New York City in 1952 to join her family. She became involved with New York City\\'s downtown artists scene in the early 1960s, which included the Fluxus group, and became well known in 1969 when she married English musician John Lennon of the Beatles, with whom she would subsequently record as a duo in the Plastic Ono Band. The couple used their honeymoon as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War. She and Lennon remained married until he was murdered in front of the couple\\'s apartment building, the Dakota, on December 8, 1980. Together they had one son, Sean, who later also became a musician.\\nOno began a career in popular music in 1969, forming the Plastic Ono Band with Lennon and producing a number of avant-garde music albums in the 1970s. She achieved commercial and critical success in 1980 with the chart-topping album Double Fantasy, a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder, winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. To date, she has had twelve number one singles on the US Dance charts, and in 2016 was named the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time by Billboard magazine. Many musicians have paid tribute to Ono as an artist in her own right and as a muse and icon, including Elvis Costello, the B-52\\'s, Sonic Youth and Meredith Monk.\\nAs Lennon\\'s widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan\\'s Central Park, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, peace, disaster relief in Japan and the Philippines, and other such causes. In 2002, she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 LennonOno Grant for Peace. In 2012, she received the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award and co-founded the group Artists Against Fracking.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and family ===\\nOno was born in Tokyo City on February 18, 1933, to mother Isoko Ono (小野 磯子, Ono Isoko) (1911–1999) and father Eisuke Ono (小野 英輔, Ono Eisuke), a wealthy banker and former classical pianist. Isoko\\'s adoptive maternal grandfather Zenjiro Yasuda (安田 善次郎, Yasuda Zenjirō) was an affiliate of the Yasuda clan and zaibatsu. Eisuke came from a long line of samurai warrior-scholars. The kanji translation of Yōko (洋子) means \"ocean child\". Two weeks before Ono\\'s birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco, California, by his employer, the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono first meeting her father when she was two years old. Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936.\\nIn 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan, and Ono enrolled at Tokyo\\'s elite Gakushūin (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan. Ono was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of 4, until the age of 12 or 13. She attended kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores.\\nThe family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to Hanoi in French Indochina, and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the Mitsui family. She remained in Tokyo throughout World War II and the fire-bombing of March 9, 1945, during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special bunker in Tokyo\\'s Azabu district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with members of her family.\\nStarvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings in a wheelbarrow. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her \"aggressive\" attitude and understanding of \"outsider\" status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods to the countryside, where they were bartered for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made sewing machine for 60 kilograms (130 lb) of rice to feed the family. During this time, Ono\\'s father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a prisoner of war camp in China. Ono told Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! on October 16, 2007, that \"He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp.\"\\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the United States and settled in Scarsdale, New York, an affluent town 25 miles (40 km) north of midtown Manhattan. By April 1946, Gakushūin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. At 14 years old, she took up vocal training in lieder-singing.\\n\\n\\n=== College and downtown beginnings ===\\nOno graduated from Gakushūin in 1951, and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.\\nOno joined her family in New York in September 1952, enrolling at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. Ono\\'s parents approved of her college choice, but disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In 1956, Ono left college to elope with Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi, a star in Tokyo\\'s experimental community, then studying at Juilliard.\\nAt Sarah Lawrence, Ono studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained André Singer. Ono has said that her heroes at this time were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, \"I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and... he said, \\'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do, and they\\'re called avant-garde.\\'\" Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Varèse, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. Ono left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.\\nOno has often been associated with the Fluxus group, a loose association of Dada-inspired avant-garde artists which was founded in the early 1960s by Lithuanian-American artist George Maciunas. Maciunas promoted her work, giving Ono her first solo exhibition at his AG Gallery in New York in 1961. He formally invited Ono to join Fluxus, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent. However, she did collaborate with Maciunas, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.\\n\\nOno first met John Cage through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi, in Cage\\'s experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research. She was introduced to more of Cage\\'s unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand, and via his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.\\nAfter Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street and used the apartment as a studio and living space, also allowing composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. They both held a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961; the events were attended by people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim. Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. Ono presented work only once during the series.\\nIn 1961, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat Carnegie Recital Hall (smaller than the \"Main Hall\"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances.\\nThe Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono\\'s earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork as footprints were left on it. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias\\'s AG Gallery in July 1961. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant. She is credited for the album cover art for the album Nirvana Symphony by Toshiro Mayuzumi, released by Time Records in 1962.\\nAfter living apart for several years, Ono and Ichiyanagi filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents, and, suffering from clinical depression, was briefly placed into a Japanese mental institution.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career and motherhood ===\\nOn November 28, 1962, Ono married Anthony Cox, an American film producer and art promoter who had been instrumental in securing her release from the mental institution. Ono\\'s second marriage was annulled on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later, on August 8, 1963.\\nThe marriage quickly fell apart, but the couple continued working together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo\\'s Sogetsu Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko\\'s parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her publicity.\\nOno had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted Cut Piece. In September 1966, Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist Gustav Metzger\\'s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966. She was the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak. She premiered The Fog Machine during her Concert of Music for the Mind at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.\\nOno and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. During a 1971 custody battle, Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use. Ono\\'s ex-husband changed Kyoko\\'s name to \"Ruth Holman\" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the Church of the Living Word (or \"the Walk\"). Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She would finally see Kyoko again in 1998.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship with John Lennon ===\\n\\nOno\\'s first contact with any member of the Beatles occurred when she visited Paul McCartney at his home in London to obtain a Lennon–McCartney song manuscript for a book John Cage was working on, Notations. McCartney declined to give her any of his manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon later gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to \"The Word\".\\nOno and Lennon first met on November 7, 1966, at the Indica Gallery in London, where she was preparing Unfinished Paintings, her conceptual art exhibit about interactive painting and sculpture. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. One piece, Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting, had a ladder painted white with a magnifying glass at the top. When Lennon climbed the ladder, he looked through the magnifying glass and was able to read the word YES which was written in miniature. He greatly enjoyed this experience as it was a positive message, whereas most concept art he encountered at the time was anti-everything.\\nLennon was also intrigued by Ono\\'s Hammer a Nail where viewers were invited to hammer a nail into a wooden board painted white. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don\\'t you know who this is? He\\'s a millionaire! He might buy it.\" Ono feigned not knowing of the Beatles (even as she had gone to see Paul McCartney asking for a Beatle song score), but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \"I\\'ll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"\\nIn a 2002 interview, Ono said, \"I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation.\" Ono started writing to Lennon, sending him her conceptual artworks, and soon the two began corresponding. In September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono\\'s solo Half-A-Wind Show, at Lisson Gallery in London. When Lennon\\'s wife Cynthia asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\".\\nIn early 1968, while the Beatles were making their visit to India, Lennon wrote the song \"Julia\" and included a reference to Ono: \"Ocean child calls me\", referring to the translation of Yoko\\'s Japanese spelling. In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording a selection of avant-garde tape loops, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\". The recordings made by the two during this session ultimately became their first collaborative album, the musique concrete work Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins. When Lennon\\'s wife returned home, she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon, who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\"\\nOn September 24 and 25, 1968, Lennon wrote and recorded \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\", which contains sexual references to Ono. Ono became pregnant, but had a miscarriage of a male child on November 21, 1968, a few weeks after Lennon\\'s divorce from Cynthia was granted. On December 12, 1968, Lennon and Ono participated in the BBC documentary about The Rolling Stones, The Rolling Stones Rock And Roll Circus, along with several other high-profile musicians. Lennon performed his Beatles composition \"Yer Blues\" towards the end, with an improvised vocal performance by Ono rounding out the set. The film would not be released until 1996, due to the death of The Rolling Stones\\' founding member Brian Jones a few months after it was shot.\\n\\n\\n==== Early collaborations, marriage and \"Bed-ins\" ====\\n\\nDuring the final two years of the Beatles, Lennon and Ono created and attended public protests against the Vietnam War. They collaborated on a series of avant-garde recordings, beginning in 1968 with Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins, which notoriously featured an unretouched image of the two artists nude on the front cover. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental sound collage to The Beatles\\' self-titled \"White Album\" called \"Revolution 9\", with Ono contributing additional vocals to \"Birthday\", and one lead vocal line on \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\", marking the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.\\nOn March 20, 1969, Lennon and Ono were married at the registry office in Gibraltar and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-in for Peace. They planned another Bed-in in the US, but were denied entry to the country. They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling \"guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me.\" The couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in \"bagism\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles\\' song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\".\\nDuring the Amsterdam Bed In press conference, Yoko also earned controversy in the Jewish community for saying during the press conference that, \"If I was a Jewish girl in Hitler\\'s day, I would approach him and become his girlfriend. After 10 days in bed, he would come to my way of thinking. This world needs communication. And making love is a great way of communicating.\"\\nLennon changed his name by deed poll on April 22, 1969, switching out Winston for Ono as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon after that, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire, in southeast England. When Ono was injured in a car crash, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles\\' last recorded album, Abbey Road.\\n\\n\\n==== The Plastic Ono Band ====\\n\\nAfter \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", Lennon and Ono decided it would be better to form their own band to release their newer, more personally representative work, rather than release the material as the Beatles. To this end they formed the Plastic Ono Band, a name coined by Lennon after Ono\\'s use of \"plastic stands\" for recording purposes. The name had earlier been attached to a sound and light installation conceived by Ono which had been installed in the Apple press office. The installation consisted of four perspex columns, each representing a member of the Beatles, with one holding a tape recorder and amplifier, the second a closed-circuit TV and camera, the third a record player and amplifier, and the fourth a miniature light show and loud speaker.\\nIn July 1969, Lennon\\'s first solo single, \"Give Peace a Chance\" (backed by Ono\\'s \"Remember Love\") was the first release to be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was followed in October by \"Cold Turkey\" (backed by Ono\\'s \"Don\\'t Worry Kyoko (Mummy\\'s Only Looking for her Hand in the Snow)\"). The singles were followed in December by the group\\'s first album, Live Peace in Toronto 1969, which had been recorded live at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in September. This incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed two original feedback-driven compositions, \"Don\\'t Worry Kyoko\" and \"John John (Let\\'s Hope For Peace)\", constituting the entirety of the second half of the live album.\\n\\n\\n==== Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band and Fly ====\\n\\nOno released her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band in 1970, as a companion piece to Lennon\\'s John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono\\'s featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon\\'s a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise instead of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.\\n\\nWhen Lennon was invited to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she released Fly, a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including \"Midsummer New York\" and \"Mind Train\", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad \"Mrs. Lennon\". The track \"Don\\'t Worry, Kyoko (Mummy\\'s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\" was an ode to Ono\\'s missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono\\'s ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out of court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko. Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. During this time, she wrote \"Don\\'t Worry Kyoko\", which also appears on Lennon and Ono\\'s album Live Peace in Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" when Yoko whispers \"Happy Christmas, Kyoko\", followed by Lennon whispering, \"Happy Christmas, Julian.\" The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally disabled children organized by WABC-TV\\'s Geraldo Rivera.\\nIn a 2018 issue of Portland Magazine, editor Colin W. Sargent writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine, in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. \"We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don\\'t really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful.\"\\nIn 1973, Ono recorded a single, \"Joseijoi Banzai, Parts 1 and 2\" with musicians billed as the Plastic Ono Band and Elephants Memory and released it only in Japan. She cheered feminism by combining lyrics inspired by Japanese war songs with Pop rhythms, signalling a new direction.\\n\\n\\n==== Separation and reconciliation ====\\nAfter the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to Manhattan to escape tabloid racism towards Ono. Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono\\'s separation from her daughter. The couple separated in July 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between Los Angeles and New York with personal assistant May Pang; Ono had given her blessing to Lennon and Pang\\'s relationship.\\nBy December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono\\'s phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, Lennon failed to return home or call Pang. When she telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress, which did not happen.\\nOno and Lennon\\'s son, Sean, was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon\\'s 35th birthday. Following the birth of Sean, both Lennon and Ono took a hiatus from the music industry, with Lennon becoming a stay-at-home dad to care for his infant son. Sean has followed in his parents\\' footsteps with a career in music; he performs solo work, works with Ono and formed a band, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to music and murder of Lennon ===\\n\\nIn early 1980, Lennon heard Lene Lovich and the B-52\\'s\\' \"Rock Lobster\" while on vacation in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono\\'s musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream (the band had in fact been influenced by Ono). Ono and Lennon began trading songs over the phone with each other, quickly accumulating enough material to record. The emerging album was structured as a dialogue, and was to be credited to John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a duo. It would also mark the return of Lennon to the public eye after a five-year absence, as well as a public reconciliation of Ono and Lennon.\\nDouble Fantasy was released on November 17, 1980, and received tepid initial reviews, with much of the criticism centering on the idealization of Lennon and Ono\\'s marriage and supposed domestic bliss. However, the reception and the legacy of the album would be forever linked with what happened just weeks after its release.\\nOn the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were at the Record Plant Studio and working on Ono\\'s song \"Walking on Thin Ice\". When they returned to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman, a Beatles fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. Yoko cradled the dying Lennon in her arms, and for a time afterward, lived in constant fear of her own and her son Sean\\'s assassination.\\nAfter John\\'s death, the interior decorator Sam Havadtoy moved in to support her. \"Walking on Thin Ice (For John)\" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono\\'s first chart success as a solo artist, peaking at No. 58 and gaining significant underground airplay. Double Fantasy received an instant critical reappraisal, eventually becoming a landmark album of the 1980s, and winning Ono the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards.\\nIn 1981, she released the album Season of Glass, which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon\\'s bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the liner notes to Season of Glass, Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because \"he would have been offended—he was one of us.\" The album received highly favorable reviews and reflected the public\\'s mood after Lennon\\'s assassination.\\nIn 1982, she released It\\'s Alright. The cover featured Ono in her wrap-around sunglasses, looking towards the sun, while on the back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son. The album scored minor chart success and airplay with the single \"Never Say Goodbye\".\\nIn 1984, a tribute album titled Every Man Has a Woman was released, featuring a selection of songs written by Ono performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson.  Later that year, Ono and Lennon\\'s final album, Milk and Honey, was released as a mixture of unfinished Lennon recordings from the Double Fantasy sessions, and new Ono recordings. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries as well as in Canada.\\nOno funded the construction and maintenance of the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan\\'s Central Park, directly across from the Dakota, which was the scene of the murder and remains Ono\\'s residence to this day. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday.\\nOno\\'s final album of the 1980s was Starpeace, a concept album that she intended as an antidote to Ronald Reagan\\'s \"Star Wars\" missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. Starpeace became Ono\\'s most successful non-Lennon effort. The single \"Hell in Paradise\" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won \"Most Innovative Video\" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.\\nIn 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.\\n\\n\\n=== Resurgence and collaborations ===\\nIn 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant Jeff Pollack to honor what would have been Lennon\\'s 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of \"Imagine\". Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.\\nOno went on a musical hiatus following the release of Starpeace, until she signed with Rykodisc in 1992 and released the comprehensive six-disc box set Onobox. The box set included remastered highlights from Ono\\'s solo albums and previously unreleased material from the 1974 \"lost weekend\" sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from Onobox, simply titled Walking on Thin Ice. That year, she sat down for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine Option. The story took a revisionist look at Ono\\'s music for a new generation of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the blending of pop and avant-garde music.\\nIn 1994, Ono produced her own off-Broadway musical entitled New York Rock, which featured Broadway renditions of her songs.\\nIn 1995, Ono released Rising, a collaboration with her son Sean and his then-band, Ima. Rising spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled Rising Mixes. Guest remixers of Rising material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore.\\nIn 1997, Rykodisc reissued Ono\\'s catalog of solo recordings on CD, from Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band through Starpeace. Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts. In the same year, Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition program for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honor John Lennon\\'s memory and his large creative legacy. Over $350,000 has been given through BMI Foundation\\'s John Lennon Scholarships to talented young musicians in the United States, making it one of the most respected awards for emerging songwriters.\\nIn 2000, Ono founded the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan, which housed over 130 pieces of Lennon and Beatles memorabilia from Ono\\'s private collection. The museum closed in 2010.\\nOno\\'s feminist concept album Blueprint for a Sunrise was released in 2001. A month after the 9/11 attacks, Ono organized the concert \"Come Together: A Night for John Lennon\\'s Words and Music\" at Radio City Music Hall. Hosted by the actor Kevin Spacey and featuring Lou Reed, Cyndi Lauper and Nelly Furtado, it raised money for September 11 relief efforts and aired on TNT and the WB.\\n\\n\\n=== Later life and dance chart hits ===\\nIn 2002, Ono joined the B-52\\'s in New York for their 25th anniversary concerts; she came out for the encore and performed \"Rock Lobster\" with the band. In March 2002, she was present with Cherie Blair at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon to mark the renaming of Liverpool airport to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.\\nBeginning in 2003, some DJs remixed other Ono songs for dance clubs. For the remix project, she dropped her first name and became known simply as \"ONO\", in response to the \"Oh, no!\" jokes that dogged her throughout her career. Ono had great success with new versions of \"Walking on Thin Ice\", remixed by top DJs and dance artists including Pet Shop Boys, Orange Factory, Peter Rauhofer, and Danny Tenaglia. In April 2003, Ono\\'s Walking on Thin Ice (Remixes) was rated number 1 on Billboard\\'s Dance/Club Play chart, gaining Ono her first no. 1 hit. She would have a second no. 1 hit on the same chart in November 2004 with \"Everyman... Everywoman...\", a reworking of her song \"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\".\\nDuring the Liverpool Biennial in 2004, Ono flooded the city with two images on banners, bags, stickers, postcards, flyers, posters and badges: one of a woman\\'s naked breast, the other of the same model\\'s vulva. During her stay in Lennon\\'s city of birth, she said she was \"astounded\" by the city\\'s renaissance. The piece, titled My Mummy Was Beautiful, was dedicated to Lennon\\'s mother, Julia, who had died when he was a teenager. According to Ono, the work was meant to be innocent, not shocking; she was attempting to replicate the experience of a baby looking up at its mother\\'s body, those parts of the mother\\'s body being a child\\'s introduction to humanity.\\nOno performed at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, Like many of the other performers during the ceremony, she wore white to symbolize the snow of winter. She read a free verse poem calling for world peace as an introduction to Peter Gabriel\\'s performance of \"Imagine\".\\nOn December 13, 2006, one of Ono\\'s bodyguards was arrested after he was allegedly taped trying to extort $2 million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted grand larceny. On February 16, 2007, a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.\\nOno released the album Yes, I\\'m a Witch in February 2007, a collection of remixes and covers from her back catalog by various artists including The Flaming Lips, Cat Power, Anohni, DJ Spooky, Porcupine Tree, and Peaches, along with a special edition of Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band. Yes I\\'m a Witch was critically well received. A similar compilation of Ono dance remixes entitled Open Your Box was also released in April.\\nOn June 26, 2007, Ono appeared on Larry King Live along with McCartney, Starr and Olivia Harrison. She headlined the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago on July 14, 2007, performing a full set that mixed music and performance art. She sang \"Mulberry\", a song about her time in the countryside after the Japanese collapse in World War II for only the third time ever, with Thurston Moore: She had previously performed the song with John and with Sean. On October 9 of that year, the Imagine Peace Tower on Viðey Island in Iceland, dedicated to peace and to Lennon, was turned on with her, Sean, Ringo, and Olivia in attendance. Each year between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light into the sky.\\n\\nOno returned to Liverpool for the 2008 Liverpool Biennial, where she unveiled Sky Ladders in the ruins of Church of St Luke (which was largely destroyed during World War II and now stands roofless as a memorial to those killed in the Liverpool Blitz). Two years later, on March 31, 2009, she went to the inauguration of the exhibition \"Imagine: The Peace Ballad of John & Yoko\" to mark the 40th anniversary of the Lennon-Ono Bed-In at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Canada, from May 26 to June 2, 1969. The hotel had been doing steady business with the room they stayed in for over 40 years. That year Ono became a grandmother when Emi was born to her daughter Kyoko.\\nOno had further Dance/Club Play chart no. 1 hits with \"No No No\" in January 2008, and \"Give Peace a Chance\" the following August. In June 2009, at the age of 76, Ono scored her fifth no. 1 hit on the Dance/Club Play chart with \"I\\'m Not Getting Enough\".\\nIn May 2009, she designed a T-shirt for the second Fashion Against AIDS campaign and collection of HIV/AIDS awareness, NGO Designers Against AIDS, and H&M, with the statement \"Imagine Peace\" depicted in 21 languages. Ono appeared onstage at Microsoft\\'s June 1, 2009, E3 Expo press conference with Olivia Harrison, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr to promote the Beatles: Rock Band video game, which was universally praised by critics. Ono appeared on the Basement Jaxx album Scars, featuring on the single \"Day of the Sunflowers (We March On)\". In the same year, she became an honorary patron to Alder Hey Charity, and created an exhibit called \"John Lennon: The New York City Years\" for the NYC Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon\\'s life in New York. A portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up and founded by Lennon and Ono.\\n\\n\\n=== The new Plastic Ono Band ===\\nIn 2009, Ono recorded Between My Head and the Sky, which was her first album to be released as \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" since 1973\\'s Feeling the Space. The all-new Plastic Ono Band lineup included Sean Lennon, Cornelius, and Yuka Honda. On February 16, 2010, Sean organized a concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music called \"We Are Plastic Ono Band\", at which Yoko performed her music with Sean, Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner for the first time since the 1970s. Guests including Bette Midler, Paul Simon and his son Harper, and principal members of Sonic Youth and the Scissor Sisters interpreted her songs in their own styles.\\nOn April 1, 2010, she was named the first \"Global Autism Ambassador\" by the Autism Speaks organization. She had created an artwork the year before for autism awareness and allowed it to be auctioned off in 67 parts to benefit the organization. In April 2010, RCRD LBL made available free downloads of Junior Boys\\' mix of \"I\\'m Not Getting Enough\", a single originally released 10 years prior on Blueprint for a Sunrise. That song and \"Wouldnit (I\\'m a Star)\", released September 14, made it to Billboard\\'s end of the year list of favorite Dance/Club songs at No. 23 and No. 50 respectively.\\nOno appeared with Starr on July 7 at New York\\'s Radio City Music Hall in celebration of Starr\\'s 70th birthday, performing \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"Give Peace a Chance\". On September 16, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian Lennon\\'s photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City, appearing for the first time photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted his work on her website. On October 2, Ono and the Plastic Ono Band performed at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, with special guest Lady Gaga, whom she deeply admires.\\nOn February 18, 2011 (her 78th birthday), Ono took out a full-page advert in the UK free newspaper Metro for \"Imagine Peace 2011\". It took the form of an open letter, inviting people to think of, and wish for, peace. With son Sean, she held a benefit concert to aid in the relief efforts for earthquake and tsunami-ravaged Japan on March 27 in New York City. The effort raised a total of $33,000. The same year, \"Move on Fast\" became her sixth consecutive number-one hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her eighth number-one hit overall. She also collaborated with The Flaming Lips on an EP entitled The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band.\\nIn July 2011, she visited Japan to support earthquake and tsunami victims and tourism to the country. During her visit, Ono gave a lecture and performance entitled \"The Road of Hope\" at Tokyo\\'s Mori Art Museum, during which she painted a large calligraphy piece entitled \"Dream\" to help raise funds for construction of the Rainbow House, an institution for the orphans of the Great East Japan earthquake. She also collected the 8th Hiroshima Art Prize for her contributions to art and for peace, that she was awarded the year prior.\\nIn January 2012, a Ralphi Rosario mix of her 1995 song \"Talking to the Universe\" became her seventh consecutive No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In March of the same year, she was awarded the 20,000-euro ($26,400) Oskar Kokoschka Prize in Austria. From June 19 to September 9, her work To the Light was exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery in London. It was held in conjunction with the London 2012 Festival, a 12-week UK-wide celebration featuring internationally renowned artists from Midsummer\\'s Day (June 21) to the final day of the Paralympic Games on September 9. The album Yokokimthurston was also released in 2012, featuring a collaboration with Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth. AllMusic characterized it as \"focused and risk-taking\" and \"above the best\" of the couple\\'s experimental music, with Ono\\'s voice described as \"one-of-a-kind\".\\nOn June 29, 2012, Ono received a lifetime achievement award at the Dublin Biennial. During this (her second) trip to Ireland (the first was with John before they married), she visited the crypt of Irish leader Daniel O\\'Connell at Glasnevin Cemetery and Dún Laoghaire, from where Irish departed for England to escape the famine. In February 2013, Ono accepted the Rainer Hildebrandt Medal at Berlin\\'s Checkpoint Charlie Museum, awarded to her and Lennon for their lifetime of work for peace and human rights. The next month, she tweeted an anti-gun message with the Season of Glass image of Lennon\\'s bloodied glasses on what would have been her and Lennon\\'s 44th anniversary, noting that guns have killed more than 1 million people since Lennon\\'s death in 1980. She was also given a Congressional citation from the Philippines for her monetary aid to the victims of typhoon Pablo, as well as her donation to disaster relief efforts after typhoon Ondoy in 2009 and assistance of Filipino schoolchildren.\\nIn 2013, she and the Plastic Ono Band released the LP Take Me to the Land of Hell, which featured numerous guests including Yuka Honda, Cornelius, Hirotaka \"Shimmy\" Shimizu, mi-gu\\'s Yuko Araki, Wilco\\'s Nels Cline, Tune-Yards, Questlove, Lenny Kravitz, and Ad-Rock and Mike D of the Beastie Boys. In June 2013, she curated the Meltdown festival in London, where she played two concerts, one with the Plastic Ono Band, and the second on backing vocals during Siouxsie Sioux\\'s rendition of \"Walking on Thin Ice\" at the Double Fantasy show. In July, OR Books published Ono\\'s sequel to 1964\\'s Grapefruit, another book of instruction-based \\'action poems\\' this time entitled, Acorn.\\nHer online video for \"Bad Dancer\" released in November 2013, which featured some of these guests, was well-liked by the press. By the end of the year she had become one of three artists with two songs in the Top 20 Dance/Club and had two consecutive number 1 hits on Billboard\\'s Hot Dance Club Play Charts. On the strength of the singles \"Hold Me\" (Featuring Dave Audé) and \"Walking on Thin Ice\", the then-80-year-old beat Katy Perry, Robin Thicke and her friend Lady Gaga.\\nIn 2014, \"Angel\" was Ono\\'s twelfth number one on the US Dance chart. Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band continued to perform live into 2015.\\nOn February 16, 2016, Manimal Vinyl released Yes, I\\'m a Witch Too, which features remixes from Moby, Death Cab For Cutie, Sparks, and Miike Snow. Like its predecessor, Yes, I\\'m a Witch Too received critical acclaim. On February 26, 2016, Ono was hospitalized after suffering what was rumored to be a possible stroke. It was later announced that she was experiencing extreme symptoms of the flu.  On September 6, 2016, Secretly Canadian announced that they would be re-issuing 11 of Ono\\'s albums from 1968 to 1985; Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins through Starpeace. In December 2016, Billboard magazine named her the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time.\\nIn October 2018, Ono released Warzone, which included new versions of previously recorded tracks including \"Imagine\".\\nIn a piece for the New Yorker published in November 2021, it was noted that Ono had \"withdrawn from public life\", with her son Sean now acting as the public representative for the family\\'s interests in the Beatles\\' business.\\n\\n\\n== Artwork ==\\n\"Art is like breathing for me. If I don\\'t do it, I start to choke.\" – Yoko Ono\\n\\n\\n=== Cut Piece, 1964 ===\\nOno was a pioneer of conceptual art and performance art. A seminal performance work is Cut Piece, first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion. The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York\\'s Carnegie Hall in 1965 and London\\'s Africa Center as part of the Destruction in Art Symposium in 1966. Of the piece, John Hendricks wrote in the catalogue to Ono\\'s Japan Society retrospective: \"[Cut Piece] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model ... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art.\"\\nOther performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks. Ono reprised the piece in Paris in 2003, in the low post-9/11 period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is \"a time where we need to trust each other\". In 2013, the Canadian singer Peaches reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre in London, which Ono curated.\\n\\n\\n=== Grapefruit book, 1964 ===\\n\\nOno\\'s small book titled Grapefruit is another seminal piece of conceptual art. First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is \"Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies.\" Grapefruit has been published several times, most widely distributed by Simon & Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. David Bourdon, art critic for The Village Voice and Vogue, called Grapefruit \"one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s\". He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and \"did virtually the same things\" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.\\nOno would enact many of the book\\'s scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized retrospective exhibition, This Is Not Here in 1971 at the Everson Museum in Syracuse, New York, that was nearly closed when it was besieged by excited Beatles fans, who broke several of the art pieces and flooded the toilets. It was her last major exhibition until 1989\\'s Yoko Ono: Objects, Films retrospective at the Whitney.\\nNearly fifty years later in July 2013, she released a sequel to Grapefruit, another book of instructions, Acorn via OR Books.\\n\\n\\n=== Do It Yourself Fluxfest, 1966 ===\\na 20-piece collection conjoining short instructional texts by Ono with Maciunas\\' graphic illustrations. First printed in \"3 newspaper events for the price of $1\", the No. 7, February 1966 issue of the Fluxus magazine cc V TRE, the compilation underscores the Fluxus idea that anyone can make art. These amusing pieces find meaning in the humorous dialogue that exists between Ono\\'s instructions and Maciunas\\' skillful treatment of text with relation to pictorial motifs.\\n\\n\\n=== Experimental films, 1964–1972 ===\\nOno was also an experimental filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, often referred to as Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film. She also collaborated with Lennon on the film Fly (1970), the soundtrack of which appeared on her 1971 album Fly.\\nIn March 2004, the ICA London, showed most of her films from this period in their exhibition The Rare Films of Yoko Ono. She also acted in an obscure exploitation film in 1965, Satan\\'s Bed.\\n\\n\\n=== Wish Tree, 1996–present ===\\n\\nAnother example of Ono\\'s participatory art was her Wish Tree project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 Wish Piece had the following instructions:\\n\\nMake a wish\\nWrite it down on a piece of paper\\nFold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree\\nAsk your friends to do the same\\nKeep wishing\\nUntil the branches are covered with wishes.\\nHer Wish Tree installation in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, established in July 2010, has attracted contributions from all over the world. Other installation locations include London; St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Copenhagen; the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California; Japan; Venice; Dublin; and, Miami at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in 2010.\\n\\nIn 2014 Ono\\'s Imagine Peace exhibit opened at the Bob Rauschenburg Gallery at Florida SouthWestern State College in Fort Myers, Florida. Ono installed a billboard on U.S. Route 41 in Fort Myers to promote the show and peace.  When the exhibit closed, wishes that had been placed on the installed Wish Trees were sent to the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland and added to the millions of wishes already there. Imagine Peace was also installed in Houston in 2011 through the Deborah Colton Gallery, returning in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Earth Peace, 2014 ===\\nOne of two pieces Ono installed as part of the 2014 Folkestone Triennial, Earth Peace originally consisted of many parts and appeared in many locations and media around Folkestone, including posters, stickers, billboards and badges. Three of the pieces remain in Folkestone, on loan to the town and part of the Creative Folkestone Artworks collection. These include an inscribed stone, a flag – which is flown on an annual basis on International Peace Day and a beacon of light installed on the dome roof of The Grand in Folkestone Leas. Ono\\'s beacon flashes a morse code message, \"Earth Peace\", across the English Channel.\\n\\n\\n=== Skyladder, 2014 ===\\nThe second of Ono\\'s 2014 Folkestone Triennial pieces and now also on loan to the town as part of the Folkestone Artworks collection, Skyladder is displayed in two locations – on a high wall of the Quarterhouse bar and in the staircase of the Folkestone public library. Skyladder takes the form of an artistic \\'instruction\\' or invitation to the people of Folkestone and beyond. The instruction reads: \"Audience should bring a ladder they like. Colour it. Word it. Take pictures of it. Keep adding things to it. And send it as a postcard to a friend\".\\n\\n\\n=== Arising, 2015 ===\\nIn 2015, Ono created the piece Arising in Venice. As part of the exhibition Personal Structures, organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre\\'s Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagery of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record Rising and this piece, Ono responded: \"Rising was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope Arising will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Skylanding, 2016 ===\\n\\nIn October 2016, Ono unveiled her first permanent art installation in the United States; the collection is located in Jackson Park, Chicago and promotes peace. Ono was inspired during a visit to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and feels a connection to the city of Chicago.\\n\\n\\n=== Refugee Boat, 2019 ===\\nParticipating in Lower Manhattan\\'s River to River Festival in 2019, Ono presented her participatory installation Add Color (Refugee Boat) (1960/2019). The work comprises a white room with a white rowing boat in it, which were both covered by messages and drawings from members of the audience throughout the festival. Through the participatory nature of the work, the artist emphasised the need for solidarity and the history of immigrants and refugees in the United States. Refugee Boat belongs to Ono\\'s Add Color Painting series, first enacted in 1960, which invites the audience to make marks over the designated objects, often white.\\n\\n\\n=== Recognition and retrospectives ===\\n\\nJohn Lennon once described his wife as \"the world\\'s most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but nobody knows what she does\". Her circle of friends in the New York art world has included Kate Millett, Nam June Paik, Dan Richter, Jonas Mekas, Merce Cunningham, Judith Malina, Erica Abeel, Fred DeAsis, Peggy Guggenheim, Betty Rollin, Shusaku Arakawa, Adrian Morris, Stefan Wolpe, Keith Haring, and Andy Warhol (she was one of the speakers at Warhol\\'s 1987 funeral), as well as George Maciunas and La Monte Young. In addition to Mekas, Maciunas, Young, and Warhol, she has also collaborated with DeAsis, Yvonne Rainer and Zbigniew Rybczyński.\\nIn 1989, the Whitney Museum held a retrospective of her work, Yoko Ono: Objects, Films, marking Ono\\'s reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono\\'s live-in companion at the time, interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. \"I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there\\'s something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it\\'s the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way – solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified.\"\\nOver a decade later, in 2001, Y E S YOKO ONO, a 40-year retrospective of Ono\\'s work, received the International Association of Art Critics USA Award for Best Museum Show Originating in New York City, considered one of the highest accolades in the museum profession. YES refers to the title of a 1966 sculptural work by Yoko Ono, shown at Indica Gallery, London: viewers climb a ladder to read the word \"yes\", printed on a small canvas suspended from the ceiling. The exhibition\\'s curator Alexandra Munroe wrote that \"John Lennon got it, on his first meeting with Yoko: when he climbed the ladder to peer at the framed paper on the ceiling, he encountered the tiny word YES. \\'So it was positive. I felt relieved.\\'\" The exhibition traveled to 13 museums in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Korea from 2000 through 2003. In 2001, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Liverpool University and, in 2002, was presented with the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts from Bard College\\nand the Skowhegan Medal for work in assorted media. The next year, she was awarded the fifth MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts from the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles. In 2005, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Japan Society of New York, which had hosted Yes Yoko Ono and where she had worked in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\\nIn 2008, she showed a large retrospective exhibition, Between The Sky and My Head, at the Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany, and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, England. The following year, she showed a selection of new and old work as part of her show \"Anton\\'s Memory\" in Venice, Italy. She also received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009. In 2012, Ono held a major exhibition of her work To The Light at the Serpentine Galleries, London. She was also the winner of the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria\\'s highest award for applied contemporary art. In February 2013, to coincide with her 80th birthday, the largest retrospective of her work, Half-a-Wind Show, opened at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt\\nand travelled to Denmark\\'s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Austria\\'s Kunsthalle Krems, and Spain\\'s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\\nIn 2014 she contributed several artworks to the triennial Folkestone art festival. In 2015 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of her early work, \"Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960– 1971\".\\nIn 2022 the Kunsthaus Zürich opened a retrospective, Yoko Ono. This Room Moves at the Same Speed as the Clouds.\\nFrom the official press release, \\'In February 2024, Tate Modern will present the UK\\'s largest exhibition celebrating the ground-breaking and influential work of artist and activist Yoko Ono (b.1933, Tokyo). Spanning seven decades of the artist\\'s powerful, multidisciplinary practice from the mid-1950s to now, YOKO ONO: MUSIC OF THE MIND will trace the development of her innovative work and its enduring impact on contemporary culture. Conceived in close collaboration with Ono\\'s studio, the exhibition will bring together over 200 works including instruction pieces and scores, installations, films, music and photography, revealing a radical approach to language, art and participation that continues to speak to the present moment.\\'\\n\\n\\n== Political activism, social media and public appreciation ==\\n\\nOno has been an activist for peace and human rights since the 1960s. After she and Lennon married in Gibraltar, they held a March 1969 \"Bed-In for Peace\" in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel. The newlyweds were eager to talk about and promote world peace; they wore pajamas and invited visitors and members of the press. Two months later, Ono and Lennon held another Bed-In at the Queen Elizabeth Fairmont in Montreal, where they recorded their first single, \"Give Peace A Chance\". The song became a top-20 hit for the newly christened Plastic Ono Band. Other performance/demonstrations with John included \"bagism\", iterations with John of the Bag Pieces she introduced in the early 1960s, which encouraged a disregard for physical appearance in judging others. In December 1969, the two continued to spread their message of peace with billboards in 12 major world cities reading \"WAR IS OVER! If You Want It – Happy Christmas from John & Yoko\".\\nIn the 1970s, Ono and Lennon became close to many radical, counterculture leaders, including Bobby Seale, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Michael X, John Sinclair (for whose rally in Michigan they flew to sing Lennon\\'s song \"Free John Sinclair\" that effectively released the poet from prison), Angela Davis, and street musician David Peel. Friend and Sexual Politics author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism. Ono and Lennon appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, taking over hosting duties for a week. Ono spoke at length about the evils of racism and sexism. She remained outspoken in her support of feminism, and openly bitter about the racism she had experienced from rock fans, especially in the UK. Her reception within the US media was not much better. For example, an Esquire article of the period was titled \"John Rennon\\'s Excrusive Gloupie\" and featured an unflattering David Levine cartoon.\\nAfter the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Ono paid for billboards to be put up in New York City and Los Angeles that bore the image of Lennon\\'s blood-splashed spectacles. Early in 2002 she paid about £150,000 ($213,375) for a billboard in Piccadilly Circus with a line from Lennon\\'s \"Imagine\": \"Imagine all the people living life in peace.\" Later the same year, she inaugurated a peace award, the LennonOno Grant for Peace, by giving $50,000 (£31,900) in prize money originally to artists living \"in regions of conflict\". The award is given out every two years in conjunction with the lighting of the Imagine Peace Tower, and was first given to Israeli and Palestinian artists. Its program has since expanded to include writers, such as Michael Pollan and Alice Walker, activists such as Vandana Shiva and Pussy Riot, organizations such as New York\\'s Center for Constitutional Rights, even an entire country (Iceland).\\nOn Valentine\\'s Day 2003, which was the eve of the Iraqi invasion by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, \"It\\'s good to speak to you. We\\'re supporting you. We\\'re all sisters together.\" The couple said that songs like \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Imagine\" inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song \"Everyman..... Everywoman.....\" to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included \"Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him\" and \"Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her\".\\nIn August 2011, she made the documentary film about the Bed-Ins Bed Peace available for free on YouTube, and as part of her website \"Imagine Peace\".\\nIn January 2013, the 79-year-old Ono, along with Sean Lennon and Susan Sarandon, took to rural Pennsylvania in a bus under the banner of the Artists Against Fracking group she and Sean created with Mark Ruffalo in August 2012 to protest against hydraulic fracturing. Other group members include Lady Gaga and Alec Baldwin.\\nOno promotes her art and shares inspirational messages and images through a robust and active Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook presence. In April 2014 her Twitter followers reached 4.69 million, while her Instagram followers exceeded 99,000. Her tweets are short instructional poems, comments on media and politics, and notes about performances.\\nIn 1987, Ono travelled to Moscow to participate in the \"International Forum for a Nuclear-free World and for the Survival of Mankind\". She also visited Leningrad, where she met with members of the local John Lennon memorial club. Among these members was Kolya Vasin, who was considered the biggest Beatles fan in the Soviet Union.\\nPublic appreciation of Ono\\'s work has shifted over time and was helped by a retrospective at a Whitney Museum branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc box set Onobox. Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the Japan Society in New York City in 2001, in Bielefeld, Germany, and the UK in 2008, Frankfurt, and Bilbao, Spain, in 2013 and The Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2015. She received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009 and the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria\\'s highest award for applied contemporary art.\\nIn January 2021, Ono was one of the founders of The Coda Collection, a service that launched in the U.S. via Amazon Prime Video Channels on February 18, 2021, the day Ono turned 88. The Coda Collection will feature a slew of music documentaries and concert films. Jim Spinello will run The Coda Channel. Yoko Ono added, \"John Lennon was always on the cutting edge of music and culture. The Coda Collection will be a new way for fans to connect on a deeper level.\"\\n\\n\\n== Public image ==\\nFor many years, Ono was frequently criticized by both the press and the public. She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music. Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted. The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple\\'s move to the US. As late as December 1999, NME was calling her a \"no-talent charlatan\".\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship with the Beatles ===\\n\\nLennon and Ono were injured in a car crash in June 1969, partway through recording Abbey Road. According to journalist Barry Miles, a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono\\'s continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles\\' career put strain on Lennon\\'s relationship with the other band members. George Harrison got into a shouting match with Lennon after Ono took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.\\nThe English press dubbed Ono \"the woman who broke up the Beatles\", which had been foreseen by Paul McCartney in 1969 during the group\\'s rehearsals for their film and album Let It Be, when he said \"It\\'s going to be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in fifty years\\' time, you know: \\'They broke up \\'cause Yoko sat on an amp.\\'\" In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up the Beatles, and Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the group began long before Ono came onto the scene. Ono herself has said that the Beatles broke up without any direct involvement from her, adding \"I don\\'t think I could have tried even to break them up.\"\\nWhile the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as Lennon–McCartney regardless of whether the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, Please Please Me, which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called Wings over America, which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon\\'s death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as \"Yesterday\", but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving former Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making \"an attempt to rewrite history\".\\nIn a Rolling Stone interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney\\'s place in the disintegration of the band. On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, Lennon Legend, the composer credit of \"Give Peace a Chance\" was changed to \"John Lennon\" from its original composing credit of \"Lennon–McCartney\". Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon\\'s first independent single under the \"Plastic Ono Band\" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song. In 2002, McCartney released another live album, Back in the U.S. Live 2002, and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as \"composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon\", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it \"an attempt to rewrite history\". Nevertheless, Ono did not sue.\\nIn 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon\\'s \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song \"Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue\", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney\\'s wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time. When Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife\\'s memorial service in Manhattan.\\nAccepting an award at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, \"You\\'re a good songwriter. It\\'s not June with spoon that you write. You\\'re a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs.\"\\nIn an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon\\'s \"lost weekend\" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. \"I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that [Paul] did for John.\" While visiting Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked \"[W]hat will make you come back to John?\" McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. \"John often said he didn\\'t understand why Paul did this for us, but he did.\" In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon\\'s post-Beatles work.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship with Julian Lennon ===\\n\\nOno had a difficult relationship with her stepson Julian, but the relationship improved over the years. He expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon\\'s estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean\\'s, adding, \"when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn\\'t he do that with me?\" Julian was left out of his father\\'s will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the media reported was \"believed to\" be in the area of £20 million, which Julian has denied.\\nHe has said that he is his \"mother\\'s boy\", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: \"Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he\\'s too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind.\" Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian\\'s photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.\\n\\n\\n=== In art and popular culture ===\\nMary Beth Edelson\\'s Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci\\'s The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles; Ono was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\"\\nThe post-punk rock band Death of Samantha, founded in 1983, named themselves after a song from Ono\\'s 1972 album Approximately Infinite Universe, also called \"Death of Samantha\".\\nCanadian rock band Barenaked Ladies\\' debut single was \"Be My Yoko Ono\", first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album Gordon. The lyrics are \"a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music\\'s foremost geniuses\". It also has a \"sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono\\'s unique vocal style in the bridge\".\\nIn 2000, American folk singer Dar Williams recorded a song titled \"I Won\\'t Be Your Yoko Ono\". Bryan Wawzenek of the website Ultimate Classic Rock described the song as \"us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists\".\\nThe British band Elbow mentioned Ono in their song \"New York Morning\" from their 2014 album The Take Off and Landing of Everything (\"Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It\\'s the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko\"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon\\'s relationship with the city. In Public Enemy\\'s song \"Bring the Noise\", Chuck D and Flavor Flav rap, \"Beat is for Sonny Bono/Beat is for Yoko Ono!\" Ono\\'s name also appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song \"Hot Topic\", and the Tally Hall song \"&\".\\nIn The Simpsons\\' episode 1 of season 5, \"Homer\\'s Barbershop Quartet\", Barney who is in Homer\\'s band, has creative disputes within the group when he falls in love with a Japanese conceptual artist who resembles Yoko Ono.\\nOno was a central theme in English comedian James Acaster\\'s 2013 show Lawnmower, which was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award for Best Show.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n== Books and monographs ==\\nGrapefruit (1964)\\nSummer of 1980 (1983)\\nただの私 (Tada-no Watashi – Just Me!)

              "  'Rita Ackermann (born April 19, 1968) is a Hungarian-born American artist recognized for her abstract paintings that incorporate human forms, primarily focusing on themes of anthropomorphism and femininity. Her works, often depicting women and allusions to fairy tales, explore the nuances of adolescent disinterest using a unique and expressive style of brushwork. She lives in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nAckermann was born in Budapest. Ackermann studied at the University of Fine Arts Budapest from 1989 until 1992, where she studied with the painter Károly Klimó. In 1992, Ackermann moved to New York City to study at The New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture through the Hanes Family Foundation. Upon arriving in New York, the artist, who was originally “Rita Bakos,” changed her name to “Rita Ackermann,” her grandmother’s maiden name.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nIn 1994, Ackermann was commissioned by The New Museum to create a faux stained-glass window titled Who Are We? Where Did We Come From?. That same year, she had her first solo exhibition at Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York City which was reviewed in Artforum by critic Keith Seward. In 1999, Ackermann mounted her first institutional exhibition at The Swiss Institute in New York. In 2002, she had a solo exhibition of paintings, collage and works on paper titled Snowfall in August at Museum Het Domein in the Netherlands. From 2006-2008 Ackermann worked exclusively in collage, resulting in a series of works she compressed between two vertical sheets of Plexiglas. Ackermann participated in the 2008 Whitney Biennial. In 2011 her collaboration with filmmaker Harmony Korine titled, “Shadow Fux” was exhibited at The Swiss Institute in New York City. Ackermann received her first major survey exhibition in 2011 titled, \"BAKOS,\" at the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art in Budapest.\\nIn 2012, Ackermann was the subject of a mid-career retrospective at Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, curated by Bonnie Clearwater. The exhibition featured paintings, drawings, and collages from 1993 to 2012. In 2014, the Sammlung Friedrichshof in Austria held an exhibition titled, \"Meditation on Violence” by Ackermann, which focused on a series of ‘chalkboard paintings’ which were the result of experimenting with pushing the boundaries of painting. A survey of the artist\\'s ‘chalkboard paintings’ was held in 2016 at Malmö Konsthall in Sweden titled, “The Aesthetic of Disappearance”. An additional survey of Ackermann’s works in chalk titled, “Movements as Monuments” was held in 2018 at La Triennale di Milano. In 2019, Ackermann began to work on her Mama series, which she has continued through today. A series of “Mama” paintings will be shown alongside her earliest drawings and paintings created from 1993-1996, in an exhibition titled \"HIDDEN\" at MASI Lugano in March 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nRita Ackermann is married to artist Daniel Turner.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nKort, Pamela, Grau, Donatien, Bezzola, Tobia (et. al.), \\'Rita Ackermann.

              "  'Paul Henry Ramirez (born 1963 in El Paso, Texas, U.S.) is an American contemporary artist known for his biomorphic abstractionist paintings. As his figural based paintings evolved to include geometrics, in 2010, Ramirez coined the term \"biogeomorphic abstraction\" to describe his own bold painting style, a fusion of biomorphic and geometric forms. He also gained notability for his site-specific installations as his paintings began to expand outside the confines of the canvas edges onto the walls of the gallery space. These site-specific installations gradually evolved to encompass the whole gallery space, creating a full environmental experience. Donald Kuspit, scholar and art critic, describes Ramirez as “an important new kind of abstract painter . . . an abstractionist playing with color and form to exciting imaginative effect.”\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nRamirez began creating site-specific installations in 1994, combining drawings, paintings, objects, sculpture, music, dance, and furniture in dialogue with architectural space and architectural elements, sometimes in collaboration with sound designers, dance choreographers, costume designers, and furniture designers. His \"total environments\" are intended to invite viewers to experience in addition to observe, to feel as if “they are coming into the belly of a painting” as they enter his world — his installation. These were first featured in New York City alternative exhibition spaces including the Drawing Center (1994), Clock Tower Gallery (1995) and Franklin Furnace (1995); and at Caren Golden Fine Art, New York (1998).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nRamirez moved from his native Texas to New Jersey in 1985, then to New York City a few years later to design window and interior displays for retailers Henri Bendel, Charivari, and Takashimaya. In 1994, he set up a studio in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, later moving his studio to the Motor Arts Building studio complex at the Grounds For Sculpture, Hamilton, New Jersey. He is represented by Ryan Lee Gallery, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nRamirez\\'s work can be found in the permanent collections of the Austin Museum of Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Crocker Art Museum, El Paso Museum of Art, Hammer Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, Kresge Art Museum, Newark Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum, Tarble Arts Center, The Hyde Collection, and Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPaul Henry Ramirez official website.\\nRYAN LEE Gallery official website.',\n",
              "  'Sir Gordon Howard Eliott Hodgkin  (6 August 1932 – 9 March 2017) was a British painter and printmaker. His work is most often associated with abstraction.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nGordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born on 6 August 1932 in Hammersmith, London, the son of Eliot Hodgkin (1905–1973), a manager for the chemical company ICI and an amateur horticulturist, and his wife Katherine, a botanical illustrator. During the Second World War, Eliot Hodgkin was an RAF officer, rising to Wing Commander, and was assistant to Sefton Delmer in running his black propaganda campaign against Nazi Germany.\\nHis maternal grandfather Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart was a journalist, lawyer, Member of Parliament (MP) and Lord Chief Justice; and the scientist Thomas Hodgkin was his great-great-grandfather\\'s older brother. Hodgkin was a cousin of the English still life painter Eliot Hodgkin (1905–1987).\\nDuring the Second World War, Hodgkin was evacuated with his mother and sister to the US, where they lived on Long Island, New York. On returning, he was educated at Eton College and then at Bryanston School in Dorset. He had decided on a career in art in early childhood and ran away from school to pursue this.\\nHe studied at the Camberwell Art School and later at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, where Edward Piper studied drawing under him.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nMemoirs (1949), one of Hodgkin\\'s earliest recorded paintings, shows the artist, then aged 17, listening to a female figure reclining on a sofa. Painted with angular forms and black outlines, the work precedes Hodgkin\\'s distinct abstract style.\\nHodgkin\\'s first solo show was in London in 1962.\\nIn 1980, Hodgkin was invited by John Hoyland to exhibit work as part of the Hayward Annual at the Hayward Gallery along with Gillian Ayres, Basil Beattie, Terry Setch, Anthony Caro, Patrick Caulfield, Ben Nicholson and others.\\nIn 1981, Hodgkin had collaborated with the Rambert Dance Company\\'s Resident Choreographer, Richard Alston, for his abstract work 1981 for the production of Night Music and later for the production of Pulcinella in 1987.\\nIn 1984, Hodgkin represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, in 1985 he won the Turner Prize, and in 1992 he was knighted.\\n\\n\\n=== British Council in India ===\\nHodgkin was invited to design a mural for the front of Charles Correa\\'s 1992 headquarters for the British Council in India.  Hodgkin\\'s mural is of a banyan tree spreading its branches across the walls.  It is a symbol of the British Council\\'s work rooted in the Indian cultural scene.  Hodgkin said of Correa:    “Charles Correa is the most perfect architect you could imagine. He first suggested that I think about the mural as an Indian flag turning into a Union Jack. I said no.”\\nIn 1995, Hodgkin printed the Venetian Views series, which depict the same view of Venice at four different times of day. Venice, Afternoon – one of the four prints – uses 16 sheets, or fragments, in a hugely complex printing process that creates a colourful, painterly effect. This piece was given to the Yale Centre of British Art in June 2006 by its Israeli family owners in order to complement the museum\\'s already-impressive collection of Hodgkins.\\nA major exhibition of his work was mounted at Tate Britain, London, in 2006. Also in 2006, The Independent declared him one of the 100 most influential gay people in Britain, as his work has helped many people express their emotions to others.\\nIn September 2010, Hodgkin and five other British artists, John Hoyland, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj, were in an exhibition entitled The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie, at the Yale Center for British Art.\\n\\nBefore his death on 9 March 2017 he was working on two UK exhibitions, one at the Hepworth Wakefield, and another at the National Portrait Gallery.\\nHis prints were hand-painted etchings and he worked with the master printer Jack Shirreff at 107 Workshop.\\nA feature of his painting was that he made the frame intrinsic to the work \"incorporated physically into the painting as part of its making, or created as an illusion to give definition to his subject.\"\\nNational Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C466/286) with Howard Hodgkin between 2008 and 2017 for its Artists\\' Lives collection held by the British Library.\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\nHodgkin was appointed a CBE in 1977, and he was knighted in 1992. He received an honorary fellowship from the London Institute in 1999. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Oxford. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2003 New Year Honours for his services to art. Hodgkin was named 2014 Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1955, Hodgkin married Julia Lane, by whom he had two children. Hodgkin knew he was gay, even when he was married, and later left his wife. In 2009, The Independent reported that he had been with his partner, the music writer Antony Peattie, for 20 years. They lived in a four-storey Georgian house in Bloomsbury, near the British Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nOn 9 March 2017, Hodgkin died at the age of 84 in a hospital in London. Tributes to him were made by several figures in British art, including Tate director Nicholas Serota.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nMichael Auping; John Elderfield; Susan Sontag; Marla Price (1995).

              "  'Jack Smith (November 14, 1932 – September 18, 1989) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pioneer of underground cinema. He is generally acclaimed as a founding father of American performance art, and has been critically recognized as a master photographer.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nSmith was raised in Texas, where he made his first film, Buzzards over Baghdad, in 1952. He moved to New York City in 1953.\\nThe most famous of Smith\\'s productions is Flaming Creatures (1963). The film, that first put camp on the map, is a satire of Hollywood B movies and tribute to actress Maria Montez, who starred in many such productions. However, authorities considered some scenes to be pornographic. Copies of the movie were confiscated at the premiere, and it was subsequently banned from public view. Despite not being viewable, the movie gained some anti-heroic notoriety when footage was screened during Congressional hearings and right-wing politician Strom Thurmond mentioned it in anti-porn speeches.\\nSmith\\'s next movie Normal Love (aka Normal Fantasy, Exotic Landlordism of Crab Lagoon, and The Great Pasty Triumph) (1963–1964) was the only work in Smith\\'s oeuvre with an almost conventional length (120 mins.), and featured multiple underground stars, including Mario Montez, Diane di Prima, Tiny Tim, Francis Francine, Beverly Grant, John Vaccaro, and others. The rest of his productions consists mainly of short movies, many never screened in a cinema, but featured in performances and constantly re-edited to fit the stage needs (including Normal Love).\\nAfter his last completed film, No President (1967), (Smith’s follow-up film, Sinbad In the Rented World (1972–1984) was never completed) he created small intermedia performance and experimental theatre work until his death on September 25, 1989, from AIDS-related pneumonia. Smith produced many theatrical mini-productions, often using slide projectors, in his loft and in art space settings such as Artists Space and Colab\\'s The Times Square Show. Descriptors of lobsters as greedy landlords dominate, along with crabs, Atlantis, 1950s exotica music, and camp-glamorous North African costumes. A pungent odor of burning incense and marijuana often perfumed the performances.\\nApart from appearing in his own work, Smith worked as an actor. He played the lead in Andy Warhol\\'s unfinished film Batman Dracula, Ken Jacobs\\'s Blonde Cobra, and appeared in several theater productions by Robert Wilson.\\nSmith also worked as a photographer and founded the Hyperbole Photographic Studio in New York City. In 1962, he released The Beautiful Book, a collection of pictures of New York artists, that was re-published in facsimile by Granary Books in 2001. As a draftsman, his posters, hand written scripts and drawing-notes superimpose a very eccentric personal imagery onto the traditional language of theater. \\nIn 1978, Sylvère Lotringer conducted a 13-page interview with Smith (with photos) in Columbia University\\'s philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e). It was collected in 2013 in Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book. In 2014, it was released as a limited-ledition vinyl picture disc by Semiotext(e). \\nIn 1987, Smith was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.\\n\\n\\n== Estate ==\\nIn 1989, New York performance artist Penny Arcade tried to salvage Smith\\'s work from his apartment after his long bout with AIDS and subsequent death. Arcade attempted to preserve the apartment as Smith had transformed it – an elaborate stage set for his never-to-be-filmed epic Sinbad in a Rented World – as a museum dedicated to Jack Smith and his work. This effort failed.\\nUntil recently, Smith\\'s archive was co-managed by Arcade, alongside the film historian J. Hoberman via their corporation, The Plaster Foundation, Inc. Within ten years of Smith\\'s death, the Foundation, operating largely without funding but through donations and good will, was able to restore all of Smith\\'s films, create a major retrospective curated by Edward Leffingwell at PS 1, the Contemporary Arts Museum, now part of MoMA, put his films back into international distribution, and publish several books on Jack Smith and his work.\\nIn January 2004, the New York Surrogate\\'s Court ordered Hoberman and Arcade to return Smith\\'s archive to his legal heir, estranged, surviving sister Sue Slater. Hoberman and Arcade fought to dismiss Slater\\'s claim, arguing that she abandoned Jack\\'s apartment and its contents; the Plaster Foundation created the archive and took possession of the work only after 14 years of repeated, documented attempts at communication with her. In a six-minute trial, Judge Eve Preminger rejected the Foundation\\'s argument and awarded the archive to Slater.\\nBy October 2006, the foundation still refused to surrender Smith\\'s archive to the estate, claiming money owed them for expenses associated with managing the archive—and hoping Smith\\'s work would be bought by an appropriate public institution that could safeguard his legacy and keep the works in the public eye. According to curator Jerry Tartaglia, the dispute was resolved as of 2008, with the purchase of Smith\\'s estate by the Gladstone Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nSmith was one of the first proponents of the aesthetics which came to be known as \\'camp\\' and \\'trash\\', using no-budget means of production (e.g. using discarded color reversal film stock) to create a visual cosmos heavily influenced by Hollywood kitsch, orientalism and with Flaming Creatures created drag culture as it is currently known. Smith was heavily involved with John Vaccaro, founder of The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, whose disregard for conventional theater practice deeply influenced Smith\\'s ideas about performance art. In turn, Vaccaro was deeply influenced by Smith\\'s aesthetics. It was Vaccaro who introduced Smith to glitter and in 1966 and 1967, Smith created costumes for Vaccaro\\'s Playhouse of The Ridiculous. Smith\\'s style influenced the film work of Andy Warhol as well as the early work of John Waters.  While all three were part of the 1960s gay arts movement, Vaccaro and Smith disputed the idea that their sexual orientation was responsible for their art.\\nIn 1992, performer Ron Vawter recreated Smith\\'s performance \"What\\'s Underground about Marshmallows\" in Roy Cohn/Jack Smith which he presented in a live performance and which was later released as a film directed by Jill Godmilow and produced by Jonathan Demme.\\nPlaywright Richard Foreman was influenced by Smith.\\nTony Conrad produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled  56 Ludlow Street that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.\\nIn 2017, Jerry Tartaglia directed a documentary called Escape from Rented Island: The Lost Paradise of Jack Smith which is a film essay concerning the works of Jack Smith, aimed at the artist\\'s most devoted followers.\\nIn 2009, Germany\\'s  Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art staged Five Flaming Days in a Rented World, a festival and conference on Smith\\'s work. The event included several commissioned short films in tribute to Smith\\'s films, the most noted of which was Guy Maddin\\'s The Little White Cloud That Cried.\\n\\n\\n== Selected filmography ==\\nBy Jack Smith\\n1952: Buzzards Over Baghdad\\n1961: Scotch Tape\\n1963: Flaming Creatures (b/w, 46 minutes)\\n1963: Normal Love (120 minutes)\\n1967: No President (a/k/a The Kidnapping of Wendell Willkie by The Love Bandit, ca. minutes)\\nWith Jack Smith as actor\\n1960: in Ken Jacobs\\'s Little Stabs at Happiness\\n1963: in Jacobs\\'s Blonde Cobra\\n1963: in Ron Rice\\'s Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man\\n1963: in Rice\\'s Chumlum\\n1965: in Andy Warhol\\'s Camp\\n1966: in Warhol\\'s Hedy (a/k/a Hedy the Shoplifter) starring Mario Montez and Mary Woronov\\n1971: in John Lennon and Yoko Ono\\'s Up Your Legs Forever\\n1974: in Ted Gershunny\\'s Silent Night, Bloody Night starring Mary Woronov, Patrick O\\'Neal, John Carradine, Candy Darling, Ondine, and Tally Brown\\n1989: in Ari Roussimoff (Frankenhooker)\\'s Shadows in the City\\nAbout Jack Smith\\n2006: Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis, documentary written, directed, and co-produced by Mary Jordan\\n\\n\\n== Books by Smith ==\\n1960 16 Immortal Photos\\n1962 The Beautiful Book (dead language press, republished 2001 Granary Books)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nHoberman, J., On Jack Smith\\'s \\'Flaming Creatures\\' (And Other Secret-Flix of Cinemaroc), New York: Granary Books, 2001\\nJ.

              "  'Félix González-Torres or Felix Gonzalez-Torres (November 26, 1957 – January 9, 1996) was a Cuban-born American visual artist. He lived and worked primarily in New York City between 1979 and 1995 after attending university in Puerto Rico. González-Torres’s practice incorporates a minimalist visual vocabulary and certain artworks that are composed of everyday materials such as strings of light bulbs, paired wall clocks, stacks of paper, and individually wrapped candies. González-Torres is known for having made significant contributions to the field of conceptual art in the 1980s and 1990s. His practice continues to influence and be influenced by present-day cultural discourses. González-Torres died in Miami in 1996 from AIDS-related illness.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nGonzález-Torres was trained as a photographer and his oeuvre incorporates this medium in varying ways. He is well known for works that transform commonplace materials into installations that foster meaningful responses from audiences, as well as works with which audiences can choose to physically interact, and works that may be manifested anew and can change each time they are exhibited. González-Torres stated “the only thing permanent is change,” always questioning the stability of the art object.\\nThroughout much of González-Torres\\'s practices, he purposefully incorporated dissonant information and formats. Examples of these contradictions include the way he structured courses as a professor, wrote press releases and texts, gave lectures, participated in interviews, and created varying strategies for each body of work. One particular example is the way Gonzalez-Torres structured a lecture on the occasion of a solo-exhibition of his work at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago in 1994. Following a slide show of various artworks and exhibitions in which his work was included, Gonzalez-Torres proceeded to read a prepared statement reflecting on the current national deficit, government budget allocations for public housing versus military spending, incarceration and poverty rates, and inequitable wealth distribution. He closed the lecture with a quote from a New York Times article that establishes a legacy of contention around the separation of church and state. This methodology was intended to foster individuals’ right and responsibility to have their own point of view.\\nOver time the work has been interpreted through varying critical lenses, including: the subjective construction of histories, questions of monumentality and attachment to permanency; the profoundness of love and partnership, codes and resilience of queer love; the role of ownership; perceptions of value and authority; discourse around death, loss, and the potentiality of renewal; questions of display and conditions of reception, notions of disidentification; the role and subversiveness of beauty; the rewards and consequences of generosity; arbitrary delineations between private and public selves/places; social, political, and personal dimensions of the AIDS epidemic; questions of established economic and political structures; occupation of the margins and infiltration of centers of power; the instability of language and what is connoted vs. denoted; somatic responses/forms of knowledge; etc. At the core of so many of the artist’s works is the physical experience of the works and their capacity to be manifest in perpetually changing circumstances. \\nGonzalez-Torres stated that his work requires an audience, following Bertolt Brecht’s theory of Epic Theatre. This is a theory that means an audience member is primed to have an individualized response to a performance that leads them to effect change in the world. Gonzalez-Torres maintained that his work should always remain open to new and changing interpretations. While Gonzalez-Torres’s work is conceptual, the formal qualities of the work are especially powerful in their ability to elicit individualized emotional responses from each viewer. “My work is about the daily dealing with events, and objects that form, transform, and affect my positioning.”\\n\\n\\n=== Categories and bodies of work ===\\nCategories and Bodies of Work most often reflect the way that Gonzalez-Torres commonly referred to works in his lifetime. Certain works may fit into more than one category/body of work. Some bodies of work by González-Torres\\'s are accompanied by Certificates of Authenticity and Ownership. The certificate includes information about the parameters for installing or exhibiting the work, the conceptual nature of the work, as well as the owner\\'s integral role in the artwork.\\n\\n\\n==== Billboards ====\\nThe billboard works date from 1989 to 1995. The billboard works consist of specific images or texts that are installed at billboard scale. It is essential to 14 of the 17 billboard works that they must be installed in multiple, diverse, public/outdoor sets of locations (ideally 24 locations at a time). Documentation of each billboard location is an essential aspect of these works.\\n\\n\\n==== Birds in sky ====\\nThe ‘birds in sky’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Images of birds in the sky are featured across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice, including billboards, doubles, framed photographs, paper stack, pedestals/platforms, and puzzles.\\n\\n\\n==== Candy works ====\\nThe ‘candy works’ date from 1990 to 1993. The dimensions for the majority of the candy works include an “ideal weight.” (In total there are 20 candy works. Fifteen of the candy works have ideal ‘weights’, four of these ‘ideal weights’ may correlate to an average body weight of an adult male, and three may correlate to a combined average body weight of two adult men.) The medium for each candy work includes “endless supply” as well as “dimensions vary with installation.” When candies are present in a manifestation of a candy work, it is integral that viewers must be permitted to choose to take individual pieces of candy from the work. The candies may or may not be replenished at any time. Candy works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. Each of the candy works are unique.\\n\\n\\n==== Curtains ====\\nThe ‘curtain’ works date from 1989 to 1995. The fabric curtain work is intended to be installed on existing windows as standard curtains would typically appear. There are five beaded curtain works, each with a specific bead pattern, and one fabric curtain work. Beaded curtain works must be installed in locations where individuals would naturally have the choice to pass through them and the work’s dimensions vary with installation. Curtain works can exist in more than one place at a time.\\n\\n\\n==== Doubles ====\\nThe ‘doubles’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Doubled objects, images, and motifs feature across the majority of the bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Framed photographs ====\\nThe framed photographic works date from 1986 to 1995. The artist considered the frame to be an essential element of these works. This is one of many bodies of Gonzalez-Torres’s works that incorporate photographic methodologies. Many of the artist’s framed photographs were purposefully analog, developed and processed by hand, as opposed to other photographic works by Gonzalez-Torres which emphasized mechanical reproducibility and the overt removal of the artist’s hand.\\n\\n\\n==== Graphs ====\\nThe ‘graph’ works date from 1988 to 1994. With the exception of one photograph, the ‘graph’ works are the only works that have hand drawn elements. The ‘graph’ works consist of both painting and drawings. While some of these works have been contextualized as representations of individuals’ medical charts, the graph works are intentionally non-specific and are also referential to other graphed data.\\n\\n\\n==== Image transfers ====\\nThe ‘image transfers’ date from 1987 to 1992. All three of these works are made in editions. Two of these works are intended to be permanently installed directly on the wall and the third is intended to be permanently tattooed.\\n\\n\\n==== Light strings ====\\nThe ‘light string’ works date from 1992 to 1994. The light strings were produced by an electrician in conversation with the artist and consist of commonplace electrical components. Each light string work can only exist in one place at a time; which is in contrast to Gonzalez-Torres’s manifestable works that are also made of commonplace materials. The dimensions of a light string work vary with each installation; the exhibitor’s choice of configuration for each installation completes the work. There are 24 individual light string works; 22 are unique and two are editioned works. The light strings works are intended to be displayed either with all the bulbs on or all the bulbs off; light bulbs are replaced promptly as necessary. The relative brightness of the lightbulbs for each light string work is specified but the actual brightness may vary from one installation to the next.\\n\\n\\n==== Mirrors ====\\nThere are four individual mirror works dating from 1992 to 1994. Three of these works consist of mirrors of a specific size that are either hung on or embedded in the wall. One of the mirror works consists of a mirrored box that is displayed on the ground.\\n\\n\\n==== Multiples ====\\nThe category of multiples represents those works made in edition sizes ranging from six to unlimited. There are 18 individual multiples in various mediums, dating from 1987 to 1995. Many of the works in this category purposefully resemble unique works, questioning notions of value and the power of the language of categorization.\\n\\n\\n==== Newspaper and magazine clippings ====\\nImagery sourced from ‘newspaper and magazine clippings’ features across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice including paper stacks, puzzles, framed works and paintings. These works include images and texts that pertain to politics, violence, consumerism, mass culture, and religion. Images of crowds are especially prominent in this category of works, and this motif carries its own diverse scope of meanings in the artist’s work. \\n\\n\\n==== Paintings ====\\nThe ‘paintings’ date from 1992 to 1994. There are 15 individual paintings, and each of the works is unique. Five of the works are circular canvases painted black with circular newspaper/magazine clippings of crowd imagery adhered to the canvases. Seven of the paintings are graph works. Nine of the painting works include multiple components of the same or similar sizes and shapes.\\n\\n\\n==== Paper stacks ====\\nThe ‘paper stacks’ date from 1988 to 1993. The paper stack works consist of a stack (or stacks) of paper. It is integral to the manifestable paper stack works that individuals must be permitted to choose to take individual sheets of paper from the work. Each paper stack work has a specific text, design, image, and/or paper color that is integral to the work. There are 45 individual paper stack works; three of the paper stack works are static (the sheets are not intended to be replenished) and four of the paper stack works have additional installation elements. The sheets used to manifest a paper stack work may or may not be replenished at any time. Manifestable paper stack works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. There are 42 unique paper stack works; four were made in an edition.\\n\\n\\n==== Pedestals / platforms ====\\nThe ‘pedestals/platforms’ date from 1987 to 1992. There are seven individual pedestal/platform works, and each is unique. Two early sculpture works were presented on platforms, the first of the paper stack works includes a platform, one puzzle is presented on a platform, the one video work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice includes a platform. Two works consist of platforms, one work that includes an optional performer and one of the mirror works. Strategies that identify and question the significance of modes of presentation for artworks can be traced throughout the artist’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Photostats ====\\nThe ‘photostats’ date from 1987 to 1992. The photostats were made in small edition sizes ranging from one to four, typically with a single artist’s proof. The photostats consist of lines of white text reproduced on a solid black background. Each of the photostats are framed in simple black metal frames and the glazing reflects the viewer in the work. There are thirteen individual photostats. (These works have sometimes been referred to as ‘date pieces.’)\\n\\n\\n==== Portraits ====\\nThe portrait works date from 1989 to 1994. The portrait works consist of a horizontal line (or lines) of textual entries installed directly on the wall just below the point where the wall meets the ceiling. It is essential to the portrait works that the owner has the right to change the content of the portrait at any time, which may include: adding, subtracting, editing and sequencing entries. Portrait works can exist in more than one place at a time and dimensions vary with installation. The typeface of the text for portrait works is Trump Medieval Bold Italic. The color of the text, and in some cases the optional band of background color, is specified for each work.\\n\\n\\n==== Puzzles ====\\nThe 59 puzzle works date from 1987 to 1992. In the process of making these works, Gonzalez-Torres sent snapshots to commercial photo labs that produced novelty items, such as puzzles, from personal photos. The imagery for the puzzle works ranges from photographs of Gonzalez-Torres’s personal life to re-photographed newspaper/magazine clippings. Most consist of one individual puzzle, although four works consist of multiple components. Most puzzle works are made in editions of three with one AP (55 puzzles). There are three unique puzzle works. Those puzzles that were made in an edition may not have been produced at the same time or by the same commercial photo lab; which resulted in variations in cropping and color tone within the same edition. This body of work illustrates Gonzalez-Torres’s interest in varying modes of photographic reproduction, the effects of commercial production processes on the form of the works, and his utilization of commonplace consumer products in his practice. The puzzles were received from the photo lab fully assembled with a piece of cardboard backing and sealed inside a fitted plastic bag. For the majority of the puzzle works (56 puzzles), the artist considered the plastic bags to be an important part of the works and he described a specific method of installation using map pins (originally pushed through and eventually positioned against the plastic bags). For owner’s who requested to frame these works, the artist provided a separate methodology for framing.\\n\\n\\n===== Dateline installations =====\\n\\nAcross several bodies of work, starting as early as 1987, González-Torres employed a strategy, described by some as a “dateline,” wherein he included lists of various events/dates in a purposeful but non-chronological order. The lists included the names of social and political figures and references to cultural phenomena or world events, many of which had political and cultural historical significance. In the body of photostat works, the events/dates are printed in white type on black sheets of photographic paper presented in basic frames with reflective glazing. The viewer’s reflection was visible when reading the line of text. These lists of seeming non sequiturs prompted viewers to consider the relationships and gaps between the diverse references as well the construction of individual and collective identities and memories. González-Torres also employed this strategy for the portraits, as in \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Jennifer Flay) (1993), which includes, \"A New Dress 1971 Vote for Women, NZ 1893 JFK 1963\" as well as for the billboards, as in “Untitled” (1989), which includes, “People With AIDS Coalition 1985 Police Harassment 1969 Oscar Wilde 1895.”\\n\\n\\n=== Various Installations and Interpretations ===\\n\\nAll of González-Torres\\'s works, with few exceptions, are titled \"Untitled\" in quotation marks, sometimes followed by a parenthetical portion of the title. This was an intentional titling scheme by the artist. Rather than limiting the artworks by ascribing any singular title, the artist titled his works in this way to allow for open-ended interpretations to unfold over time. In a 1991 interview with Robert Nickas, González-Torres reflected on the titles of his artworks: “things are suggested or alluded to discreetly. The work is untitled because “meaning” is always shifting in time and place.”\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s manifestable works incorporate the process of change. A 1991 installation of \"Untitled\" (Placebo), a candy work, consisted of a carpet (roughly 20 x 30 feet) of shiny silver wrapped candies. The candies covered the floor from one side of the room to the other and extended all the way to the back wall opposite the visitor. In 2011, the same candy work, \"Untitled\" (Placebo), was installed at the Museum of Modern Art in two large rectangles divided by a walkway for visitors. A borrower/exhibitor may choose to install the work in any configuration and can also choose to use amounts of candies that differ from the \"ideal weight\". Like other candy pieces in his oeuvre, this work has an \"ideal weight\" that remains constant while the actual weight of the installed candy may fluctuate during the course of an exhibition and also from one exhibition to the next.  \\nIn 1989 González-Torres presented \"Untitled\" (Memorial Day Weekend) and \"Untitled\" (Veterans Day Sale), exhibited together as \"Untitled\" (Monuments): block-like stacks of paper printed with ambiguous content, from which the viewer is allowed to choose to take a sheet. Rather than constituting a solid, immovable monument, the stacks can be dispersed, depleted, and renewed over time. \\nAt Roni Horn\\'s 1990 solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, González-Torres encountered her sculpture \"Forms from the Gold Field\" (1980–82). González-Torres later wrote about his experience of Horn\\'s work in \"1990: L.A., The Gold Field.\" which was first published in Horn\\'s catalogue \"Roni Horn. Earths Grow Thick.\" González-Torres and Horn became acquaintances in the early 1990s, and he later created \"Untitled\" (Placebo – Landscape – for Roni) (1993). \\n\\nOne of his most recognizable works, \"Untitled\" (1991), a billboard work which features a black-and-white photograph of an unmade bed, was installed in twenty-four outdoor public locations all over New York City in 1992. Viewers would come upon the work unexpectedly while walking the streets in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Manhattan. The billboards were installed in the same manner, scale, and location as existing commercial advertising billboards. The installation, Projects 34: Felix Gonzalez-Torres, was curated and organized by Anne Umland in her role as Curatorial Assistant at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The work is dated 1991, the same year as the death of his long-time partner, Ross Laycock, from AIDS-related illness.  \\n\"Untitled\" (It\\'s Just a Matter of Time) is a billboard originally exhibited in 1992 in Hamburg, reading \"Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit.\" Whereas the general phrase It\\'s Just a Matter of Time remains constant from one installation to the next, the language the phrase is presented in may change depending on the local languages where the work is being installed.\\nIn 1993, González-Torres mounted two simultaneous gallery exhibitions in Paris entitled Travel #1 (at Galerie Ghislaine Hussenot) and Travel #2 at Galerie Jennifer Flay.\\n\\nIn addition to his manifestable “candy works” and “paper stacks”, González-Torres created other malleable works referred to as \"light strings\", which consist of generally lower-wattage/dimmer light bulbs on extension cords, installed however the exhibitor chooses; eg. hung on the wall, piled on floor, strung across a doorway, etc. The body of light strings includes fifteen physically identical light strings, each has 42 light bulbs in white porcelain light sockets, the works are differentiated only by their parenthetical titles and the types of display/installation chosen by each work\\'s owner on an ongoing basis, as well as the display/installation that authorized borrowers chose in the context of loans. Each sculpture can be arranged in any way a particular installer wishes, and thus holds the potential for unlimited variations. Over the course of any given installation, some of the bulbs may burn out but the parameters of the work specify that they have to be replaced.\\nIn 1991 González-Torres began producing sculptures consisting of strands of plastic beads strung on metal rods, which some have interpreted to include references to the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.\\n\\n\\n=== Legacy ===\\nIn May 2002, the Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation was created. The Foundation \"maintains, builds, and facilitates knowledge and understanding around the work of Gonzalez-Torres.\" The Foundation fields exhibition requests that include Felix Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work or respond to the artist\\'s practice in some way and offers ongoing guidance and support for these exhibitions. The Foundation maintains extensive exhibition and image archives and makes them accessible to anyone interested in learning about Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. The Foundation also facilitates publication projects and licenses copyright in Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. \\nThe Foundation assisted the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in the organization of the Felix González-Torres Community Art Project, a three-year initiative that sponsors visits of internationally renowned contemporary artists to the campus of the school. The Foundation initiated and funded the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Felix González-Torres Travel Grant Program, a five-year initiative that funds travel based projects for CalArts students.\\nSince 1990, González-Torres\\'s  work has been represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery, which exhibited his work both before and after his death. Starting in 2017, the estate of Felix Gonzalez-Torres has been co-represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery and David Zwirner gallery, New York.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century the critical legacy of González-Torres\\'s  work has continued to be expanded and challenged. In 2010 Artforum published an article by artist and critic Joe Scanlan titled \"The Uses of Disorder\" that took a darker look at the soft power and neoliberal economics at play in González-Torres\\'s  work. In 2017 there was public outcry over the fact that David Zwirner Gallery mounted an extensive exhibition of González-Torres\\'s  work but made no mention of the role that AIDS played in the works\\' conceptual formation, either in the exhibition proper or its press release.\\n\\n\\n=== Art market ===\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s candy work \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Marcel Brient) (1992) sold for $4.6 million at Phillips de Pury & Company in 2010, a record for the artist at auction at the time. In November 2015 González-Torres\\'s \"Untitled\" (L.A.) (1991), a 50 lb. installation of green hard candies, sold for $7.7 million at Christie\\'s, New York, a new record at the time. In 2024 his light-string work \"Untitled\" (America #3) (1992) sold for $13.6 million, also at Christie\\'s, a new record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and education ==\\nIn January 1970, González-Torres fled Cuba for Madrid, Spain when he was 12 with his older sister. Later that same year, he relocated to Puerto Rico.\\nGonzález-Torres attended the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan from 1975-1979. He moved to New York on academic scholarship to study photography at Pratt Institute in 1979, attending the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1981 and 1983. He received a BFA in photography from Pratt Institute in 1983 and obtained an MFA from the International Center of Photography and New York University in 1987.\\nHe was an adjunct Art Instructor at New York University, New York from 1987-1989 and in 1992. In 1990, Gonzalez-Torres lived in Los Angeles and taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Gonzalez-Torres was a member of Group Material from 1987-1994. In 1992 González-Torres was granted a DAAD fellowship to work in Berlin, and in 1993 a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\\nHe became an American citizen by applying for naturalization as a refugee and he chose to refer to himself as American. His name has appeared as Félix González; professionally, he chose to style his name as Felix Gonzalez-Torres and also as Félix González-Torres in languages that include diacritics.\\nThe artist met his long-term partner Ross Laycock in 1983 in New York. González-Torres and Laycock were in a relationship from 1983 – 1991; for the majority of their relationship they lived in different cities except for a period when they lived together in Los Angeles in 1990. In January 1991, Laycock died of AIDS-related causes in Toronto. Félix González\\'s partner towards the end of his life was Rafael Vasquez.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\nGonzález-Torres staged many solo exhibitions, installations, and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally during his lifetime. His notable solo shows include Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1988), New Museum, New York; Untitled: An Installation by Félix González-Torres as part of the Visual Aids Program (1989-1990), Brooklyn Museum, New York; Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1993), Magasin III Museum for Contemporary Art, Stockholm; Felix Gonzalez-Torres: Traveling (1994), originating at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1995-1996), originating at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, exhibited as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (A Possible Landscape) at Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Girlfriend in a Coma) at Musée d\\'Art Moderne de Paris.\\nThe artist also participated in numerous group shows during his lifetime, including the Whitney Biennial (1991); the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); and the Biennale of Sydney (1996).\\n\\n\\n=== Selected posthumous exhibitions ===\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1997) ====\\nImmediately following the artist\\'s death in 1996, the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, organized a career retrospective of his work, in conjunction with the publication of a two-volume catalogue raisonné covering nearly all of the artist\\'s output.\\n\\n\\n==== U.S. Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) ====\\n\\nIn 2007, González-Torres was selected as the United States\\' official representative at the Venice Biennale, curated by Nancy Spector. The artist\\'s previously controversial status influenced the 1995 decision to reject him for the Venice pavilion in favor of Bill Viola. His posthumous show (the only other posthumous representative from the United States was Robert Smithson in 1982) at the U.S. Pavilion featured, among others, \"Untitled\" (1992–1995).\\n\\n\\n==== Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form (2010–2011) ====\\nBetween 2010 and 2011, a traveling retrospective, Felix González-Torres.

At each of the stages of the exhibition tour, the show was initially installed by the exhibition\\'s curator Elena Filipovic and, halfway through its duration, is completely reinstalled by a different selected artist whose own practice has been influenced by González-Torres. Artists Carol Bove, Danh Vo, and Tino Sehgal were chosen to curate the show\\'s second half.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation (2021) ====\\nIn 2021, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art presented Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation. The exhibition was curated by Tanya Barson.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (2023) ====\\nIn 2023, David Zwirner Gallery in New York staged its second posthumous solo exhibition of work by González-Torres, including two works that had never been executed as the artist envisioned. The first, \"Untitled\" (Sagitario) (1994-1995), is a variant of the double pools of water the artist had sketched before his death: two large pools of water were embedded in the gallery floor directly adjacent to one another. This work had first been executed posthumously as two outdoor pools embedded in the ground at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, in 2001 in conjunction with the group exhibition No es sólo lo que ves: pervirtiendo el minimalismo, but the artist had originally envisioned the pools to be installed indoors. The second newly exhibited work, \"Untitled\" (1994-1995), consists of a series of indoor billboard installations that the artist had originally designed for his unrealized exhibition at the Musée d\\'Art Contemporain in Bordeaux.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n1988 Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Cintas Foundation Fellowship Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n1991 Gordon Matta-Clark Foundation Award\\n1992 Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst Fellowship (DAAD) Artists-in-Residence Program, Berlin\\n1993 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAult, Julie, and Andrea Rosen.

              "  'Anne-Lise Coste (born 1973) is a French painter living in Orthoux (south of France). Her style can best be described as confrontational and thought-provoking. Her art evokes the contemplative topics that many artist are afraid to engage in like war, friendship, desire, and sexuality.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAnne-Lise Coste was born in 1973 in Marignane, near Marseille. Her passion for nature and animals was deepened, by her inability to be a part of nature and interact with animals, due to her asthma diagnosis in early childhood. She graduated from the École supérieure d\\'art et de design Marseille-Méditerranée and also studied at the Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst in Zurich (Switzerland).\\n\\n\\n== Artistic work ==\\nCoste\\'s paintings and drawings can bring to mind the urgency of graffiti. She says about her work “having faith in the first gesture.” With a language influenced by Dadaism, the artist expresses both subjective emotions and societal criticism. During her time in New York, she included, in her artwork, displays of graffiti, to help visualize, her artwork. A lot of her artwork, was also influenced by her living and working in New York, in a small village. During this time, for seven years, she primarily focussed to express her political views, her opinions of war, her personal relationships, and her sexual desires in her artwork. These views were highlighted, in her work, by using broad strokes in her artwork, to convey a reflection, of her with a rebellious style. Some of her most famous works were influenced, by experiences from her early childhood, such as her work displayed in the exhibition titled, 5 Days and 5 Years. This is a depiction, of her memories, as a child, of the time she spent in a clinical treatment facility. She had several memories of her childhood and the trauma she experienced in the facility; this time is the time, she refers to the memories as, and she describes the memories as an exorcism. This experience, and time in the facility, influenced her to create a series of artworks, 5 Days and 5 Years. Coste has had solo exhibitions in international institutions and galleries, including Kunsthalle St. Gallen (St. Gallen, 2006), Eleven Rivington (New York, 2013), Galería NoguerasBlanchard (Barcelona, 2010, Madrid, 2015), Centre régional d\\'art contemporain Occitanie (fr) (Sète, 2019). Coste\\'s, \"The Blue Nude Women\", of 2017, consists of gestural drawings, constructed with an oil stick, on wood panel. This evokes the viewer, to approach the figure, with the ideology, of the proto abstract-expressionist views of that period. During this time, a group of works was created by Coste, that utilized the influence of looking at, a box of oil pastels. This work, reminded her of a more joyful world, where she was not reminded of the hatefulness of people, with authority, and high positions and how they can abuse that power. She was liberated, from the care of worrying, about the worlds’ opinions and able to focus her true passion instead, of the societal human hierarchy, that we all at times, feel like a hamster on a wheel, trapped and going nowhere.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMigros Museum of Contemporary Art\\nBarcelona Museum of Contemporary Art\\nFondation pour l\\'art contemporain Salomon (fr)\\nFrac des Pays de la Loire\\nNoguerasBlanchard\\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nNon, Zurich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2003, ISBN 978-3-905509-46-5\\nPoemabout, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2005, ISBN 978-3-905509-59-5\\nRemember, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2008, ISBN 978-3-905509-73-1\\nOù suis-je, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2014, ISBN 978-3-905929-63-8\\nOil paintings and pastel drawings, Zürich: Nieves, 2017, ISBN 978-3-905999-86-0\\nSors le monde, Lyon: H Editions, 2019, ISBN 979-10-96911-18-9\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nAnne-Lise Coste website',\n",

He received his BFA at the Kansas City Art Institute in 1994.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nHolstad has shown work internationally in exhibitions including Greater New York 2005 at P.S. 1 in New York, the 2004 Whitney Biennial in New York, Beautiful Lies You Could Live In at the Victoria Miro Gallery in London, Domestic Porn at the Foksal Foundation Gallery in Warsaw and The New Gothic at Cokkie Snoei in Rotterdam. His first solo exhibition in Europe was curated by Daniel Schmidt in Cologne in 2003. In 2006, he had his first museum solo exhibition The Terms of Endearment at the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami. He is represented by Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York, Victoria Miro in London, and Galleria Massimo De Carlo in Milan.\\nIn the New York Times, critic Roberta Smith wrote that \"Mr. Holstad is a one-artist collective, equally at ease with knitting, quilting, collage, drawing and sculpture; his work has a multimedia mix.\"\\nIn an Artforum review of a 2006 solo exhibition, critic Christopher Bollen wrote that \"Holstad\\'s artistic career has often centered on the public spectacle and campy aestheticizing of sexual dissonance ... [In this show], Holstad seemed to ask whether s/m codes of thirty years ago have lost their deviant power. More provocatively, he asked what happened to the spiritual and physical liberation once accessed through these forms.\" [1]\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHis work is included in collections at the Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Astrup Fearnley Museet for Moderne Kunst in Oslo, Norway.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nChristian Holstad\\nHolstad at Massimo De Carlo\\nHolstad at Victoria Miro\\nHolstad–Saatchi Gallery',\n",
              "  'Albert Oehlen (born 17 September 1954) is a German painter, installation artist and musician. He lives and works in Bühler, Switzerland and Segovia, Spain.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Krefeld, West Germany, in 1954, Oehlen moved to Berlin in 1977, where he worked as a waiter and decorator with his friend, the artist Werner Büttner. He graduated from the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg in 1978. Along with Martin Kippenberger and Georg Herold, Oehlen was a member of Berlin \"bad boy\" group.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nClosely associated with the Cologne art scene, Oehlen was a member of the Lord Jim Lodge, along with Martin Kippenberger among others. His art is related to the Neue Wilde movement. He has more recently been described as a \\'free radical\\'.\\n\\nInfluenced by other German painters such as Georg Baselitz, Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter, Oehlen focuses on the process of painting itself. During the 1980s he began combining abstract and figurative elements of painting in his works, as part of a reaction to the prevailing Neo-Expressionist aesthetic of the time. In the following years, he worked within self-imposed, often absurd, parameters. He used only gray tones for his \"Grey\" paintings and limited himself to red, yellow, and blue for another series of what he calls \"bad\" paintings that included his infamous 1986 portrait of Adolf Hitler. In his paintings of the late 1990s, each piece consists of smears and lines of paint Oehlen brushed and sprayed over collaged imagery that had been transferred to canvas by the type of gigantic inkjet printers used to manufacture billboards.\\nIn 2002, Oehlen exhibited the \"Self-Portraits\" series which included eight self-portraits among them  Frühstück Now (Self-Portrait)(1984), Self-Portrait With Open Mouth (2001) and Self-Portrait as a Dutch Woman (1983).\\nIn Oehlen\\'s recent work, flat, figurative cut-outs-all the products of computer-aided design (CAD), and gestural strokes of oil paint trade places in the service of collage. In his recent Finger Paintings, color-blocked advertisements are an extension of the canvas, providing fragmented, readymade surfaces for Oehlen\\'s visceral markings, made with his hands, as well as brushes, rags, and spray-cans.\\nIn 2014 Skarstedt Gallery, New York hosted Oehlen\\' \"Fabric Paintings\" exhibition, featuring fourteen of the twenty paintings made from 1992 to 1996, and mostly kept in his studio. In 2015 Oehlen had his first major New York exhibition, \"Albert Oehlen: Home and Garden\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art a self-portraits selection from 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nIn the 1990s, Oehlen briefly ran his own independent label, Leiterwagen, putting out experimental electronica. Since the late 1990s Oehlen has played in the bands Red Krayola and Van Oehlen. References to music are frequent in his paintings and drawings. His artwork is on CDs by Gastr del Sol, Arthur Russell, and Brooklyn-based band Child Abuse.\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\nOehlen was Professor of Painting at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 2000 to 2009.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nOehlen is the brother of fellow artist Markus Oehlen, and their father was also an artist. He lives with his wife, Esther Freund, and their three children in a village near Bühler.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Criticism ===\\nIn 2013 ArtDaily described Oehlen as \"one of the most influential, but also one of the most controversial of contemporary painters\". His paintings are also frequently compared with David Salle\\'s. However his work has not been met with universal approval. Philippe Dagen, writing in Le Monde about Oehlen\\'s 2011 exhibition in Nîmes, concluded that he was \"of only limited importance. With about 30 canvases he reveals his system with absolute, but unfortunately appalling, clarity.\" His paintings were devoid of \"any form of expression or psychic density\". His 2007 painting, Loa, is now part of the UK\\'s Tate Collection.\\n\\n\\n=== Art market ===\\nThe Galerie Max Hetzler gave Oehlen his first solo show in 1981. At a 2014 Christie\\'s auction in London, one of Oehlen\\'s self-portraits from 1984 was sold for $1.8 million, roughly three times its $670,000 high estimate. At a March 2017 Christie\\'s auction, Albert\\'s Self-Portrait with Palette sold for $3,623,230. In June 2019, at a Sotheby\\'s auction in London, his Self-Portrait with Empty Hands sold to dealer Per Skarstedt for $7,542,157, a new record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nOehlen has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including I Will Always Champion Good Painting at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London (2006), Grounswell at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (2005), Provins – Legende at Museet for Samtidskunst in Roskilde, Denmark and Spiegelbilder 1982–1985 at Max Hetzler gallery in Berlin (2005). In 2013 a retrospective of his entire oeuvre from the 1980s to 2005 consisting of over 80 works was held at MUMOK, Vienna. Oehlen\\'s work was included in the 2013 Venice Biennale. A survey of more than 30 years of work was exhibited at the Cleveland Museum of Art from 4 December 2016 until 12 March 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\nThe works of Albert Oehlen are held, among others, in the following public collections:\\n\\nArt Institute of Chicago\\nFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris\\nFonds National d\\'Art Contemporain, Puteaux\\nHamburger Kunsthalle, Hamburg\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Paris\\nMuseum für Moderne Kunst (MMK), Frankfurt/Main\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Chicago\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\\nMuseum Ludwig, Cologne\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid\\nPinakothek der Moderne, Munich\\nSaatchi Gallery, London\\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art\\nTate Modern, London\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nAlbert Oehlen at Gagosian Gallery\\nGalerie Max Hetzler, Artist Page\\nArtist\\'s page at Gary Tatintsian Gallery\\nAlbert Oehlen exhibition catalogue to accompany his show at Thomas Dane Gallery, London in 2008\\n(O\\'Brien, Glen) Interview Magazine article\\nThe Saatchi Gallery; About Albert Oehlen and his art',\n",

The slogans are usually humorous musing on art, politics, popular culture, Britain and the world in general and they often support his activist campaigns, such as his 2002 amnesty on bad art at Pierogi Gallery, New York.\\nNoted for sign painting, Smith also makes sculpture using cement, as in his 2005 Cement Soup Kitchen at Beaconsfield Gallery, London. A sculpture he proposed was shortlisted for the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London.\\n\\n[Smith] grew attracted to postures of amateurism and failure. His more recent work has suggested an interest in the utopian impulse of art as an agent for social change, although this often seems hedged with doubt or irony\\nIn March 2005 he was commissioned to curate a series of five public art projects in the Thames Gateway housing estates of Essex. The projects were collectively named Art U Need and were documented in a diary-format book by Smith in 2007. Writing of a launch event in \"glittering Notting Hill Gate\" (i.e. in fashionable and central Kensington), Lynn Barber said of Smith: \"It was a startlingly unsuitable subject for such a glossy audience, but he held them spellbound. I see him as a sort of Ian Dury of the art world, someone who keeps on trucking, doing his own thing, making absolutely no concessions to fashion or marketability, but generally giving pleasure to everyone who comes across him.\"\\nA feature documentary about the work of Bob and Roberta Smith, Make Your Own Damn Art: the world of Bob and Roberta Smith, directed by John Rogers, premiered at the East End Film Festival in 2012.\\nIn 2013, he was on the Museum of the Year selection panel. He is on the Tate board as an artist member.\\nIn October 2021, Brill contributed to World Wildlife Fund\\'s campaign, Art For Your World.\\n\\n\\n=== Speaker, writer and advocate ===\\nHe has spoken as an advocate for art education and the arts and has been a keynote speaker at symposia and conferences. A recent example of his gift for merging art and politics was illustrated in the 2006 exhibition, \"Peace Camp.\" Smith took part in and curated the show held at The Brick Lane Gallery that explored artists\\' perceptions of peace. Gavin Turk, Wolfgang Tillmans, and more than 100 other artists were featured. He created a project, the Art Party, in 2013 to make contemporary art more accessible, demonstrate its ability to influence meaningful conversation and political thought. It was launched at the Pierogi Gallery in New York and at the Hales Gallery. An Arts Council sponsored a two-day conference at Crescent Arts in North Yorkshire that year. It brought more than 2000 people who attended discussions of art education in schools and lectures, listened to music and attended performances.\\nBrill writes for The Guardian.\\n\\n\\n=== Educator ===\\nBrill is an associate professor at the School of Art, Architecture and Design at London Metropolitan University, teaching undergraduate and post-graduate students. He leads the Master of Fine Arts programme, researches and co-leads with Oriana Fox of the Public Acts studio, and tutors in fine art.\\n\\n\\n=== Musician ===\\nBrill performs music, often with a group he co-founded, The Ken Ardley Playboys, who had their first 45 released by Billy Childish on his label Hangman Records. Brill hosts The Bob & Roberta Smith Radio Show called Make Your Own Damn Music on Resonance FM.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015 election ===\\nBrill stood in the Surrey Heath constituency in the 2015 general election, under his working name, Bob and Roberta Smith. He won the fewest votes in the constituency, receiving 273 votes (0.5%) and losing his deposit. The seat was won by incumbent MP Michael Gove.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nArts Council Collection, London\\nBritish Council, London\\nGoss Michael Foundation, Dallas, Texas\\nSammlung Fiede, Aschaffenburg, Germany\\nSouthampton City Museum & Art Gallery, Southampton, England\\nTate Collection, London\\nThe New Art Gallery Walsall, Walsall, UK\\n\\n\\n== Published works ==\\nAuthor\\nArt u need: my part in the public art revolution.

              "  \"Peter Ford Young (born January 2, 1940) is an American painter.  He is primarily known for his abstract paintings that have been widely exhibited in the United States and in Europe since the 1960s. His work is associated with Minimal Art, Post-minimalism, and Lyrical Abstraction. Young has participated in more than a hundred group exhibitions and he has had more than forty solo exhibitions in important contemporary art galleries throughout his career. He currently lives in Bisbee, Arizona.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nHe began his career as an abstract painter in New York City during the mid-1960s. During the 1960s and 1970s his paintings were included in two annual exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Leo Castelli Gallery among several other important venues. In April 1971 his work was discussed at length and appeared on the cover in Artforum magazine, written by art historian and professor of modern art at Oberlin College, Ellen H. Johnson.\\nDuring the summer and early fall of 2007 Young had a major retrospective exhibition of his paintings from the period from 1963 through 1977 at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens and at the Mitchell Algus Gallery in Chelsea in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n1968 : National Endowment for the Arts Grant.\\n1969 : Theodoran Award, Solomon R.

              "  'Nancy Goldin (born September 12, 1953) is an American photographer and activist. Her work often explores LGBT subcultures, moments of intimacy, the HIV/AIDS crisis, and the opioid epidemic. Her most notable work is The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986). The monograph documents the post-Stonewall, gay subculture and includes Goldin\\'s family and friends. She is a founding member of the advocacy group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now). She lives and works in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nGoldin was born in Washington, D.C. in 1953 to middle-class Jewish parents, and grew up in the Boston suburb of Swampscott, moving to Lexington in her teens. Goldin\\'s father worked in broadcasting and served as the chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission. Goldin had early exposure to tense family relationships, sexuality, and suicide, as her parents often argued about Goldin\\'s older sister Barbara who ultimately died by suicide when Goldin was 11:This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early sixties, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behavior, beyond control. By the time she was eighteen, she saw that her only way to get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will.Goldin began to smoke marijuana and date an older man. She left home by age 13 or 14 and subsequently lived in various foster homes. At 16 she enrolled at the Satya Community School in Lincoln, MA. A Satya staff member (existential psychologist Rollo May\\'s daughter) introduced Goldin to the camera in 1969 when she was sixteen years old. Still struggling from her sister\\'s death, Goldin used the camera and photography to cherish her relationships with those she photographed. She also found the camera as a useful political tool, to inform the public about important issues silenced in America. Her early influences included Andy Warhol\\'s early films, Federico Fellini, Jack Smith, French and Italian Vogue, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nGoldin\\'s first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city\\'s gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend David Armstrong. While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin \"fell in with the drag queens,\" living with them and photographing them. Among her work from this period is Ivy wearing a fall, Boston (1973). Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, \"My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can re-create themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it\\'s brave\".\\nGoldin admitted to being romantically in love with a queen during this period of her life in a Q&A with Bomb \"I remember going through a psychology book trying to find something about it when I was nineteen. There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so ... I don\\'t know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that\\'s where I was at that time in my life\".\\nGoldin describes her life as having been completely immersed in that of the queens. \"I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did – that\\'s who I was all the time. And that\\'s who I wanted to be\". However, upon attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, when her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with Cibachrome prints. Her work from this period is associated with the Boston School of Photography.\\nFollowing graduation, Goldin moved to New York City. She began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene, along with the city\\'s vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her slideshow The Ballad of Sexual Dependency—a title taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht\\'s Threepenny Opera. Later published as a book with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these snapshot aesthetic images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. In her foreword to the book she describes it as a \"diary [she] lets people read\" of people she referred to as her \"tribe\". Part of Ballad was driven by the need to remember her extended family. Photography was a way for her to hold onto her friends, she hoped.\\nThe photographs show a transition through Goldin\\'s travels and her life. Most of her Ballad subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to drug overdose or AIDS; this tally included close friends and often-photographed subjects Greer Lankton and Cookie Mueller. In 2003, The New York Times nodded to the work\\'s impact, explaining Goldin had \"forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years.\" In addition to Ballad, she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: I\\'ll Be Your Mirror and All By Myself.\\nGoldin\\'s work is most often presented in the form of a slideshow, and has been shown at film festivals; her most famous being a 45-minute show in which 800 pictures are displayed. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. In the book Auto-Focus, her photographs are described as a way to \"learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her\". The book speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling and references one of Goldin\\'s photographs \"Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984\" as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life.\\nGoldin\\'s work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: collaborative book projects with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki; New York City skylines; uncanny landscapes (notably of people in water); her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life.\\nIn 2000, her hand was injured and she currently retains less ability to turn it than in the past.\\n\\nIn 2006, her exhibition, Chasing a Ghost, opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation Sisters, Saints, & Sybils. The work involved her sister Barbara\\'s suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films.\\nAfter some time, her photos moved from portrayals of dangerous youthful abandonment to scenes of parenthood and family life in progressively worldwide settings. Goldin currently resides and works in New York, Paris, as well as London.\\n\\n\\n== Fashion ==\\nGoldin has undertaken commercial fashion photography—for Australian label Scanlan & Theodore\\'s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign, shot with model Erin Wasson; for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta\\'s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign with models Sean O\\'Pry and Anya Kazakova, evoking memories of her Ballad of Sexual Dependency; for shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2011 with model Linda Vojtova; and for Dior in 2013, 1000 LIVES, featuring Robert Pattinson.\\nIn March 2018, clothing brand Supreme released a collaborative range with Goldin as part of their Spring/Summer 2018 collection. This consisted of jackets, sweatshirts and t-shirts in various colors, with designs titled \"Misty and Jimmy Paulette\", \"Kim in Rhinestone\" and \"Nan as a dominatrix\".\\n\\n\\n== Activism ==\\n\\nIn 2017, in a speech in Brazil, Goldin revealed she was recovering from opioid addiction, specifically to OxyContin, after being prescribed the drug after wrist surgery. She had sought treatment for her addiction and battled through rehab. This led to her setting up a campaign called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (P.A.I.N.) pursuing social media activism directed against the Sackler family for their involvement in Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of OxyContin. Goldin has said the campaign attempts to contrast the philanthropic contributions of the Sackler family to art galleries, museums and universities with a lack of responsibility taken for the opioid crisis. Goldin became aware of the Sackler family in 2017.\\nIn 2018, she organized a protest in the Sackler Wing\\'s Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The protest called for museums and other cultural institutions not to accept money from the Sackler family.\\n\\nAlso in 2018, she was one of several artists who participated in a $100 sale organized by Magnum Photos and Aperture to raise funds for Goldin\\'s opioid awareness group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now).\"I\\'ve started a group called P.A.I.N. to address the opioid crisis. We are a group of artists, activists and addicts that believe in direct action. We target the Sackler family, who manufactured and pushed OxyContin, through the museums and universities that carry their name. We speak for the 250,000 bodies that no longer can.\"In February 2019, Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim Museum in New York over its acceptance of funding by the Sackler family.\\nShe also said that she would withdraw from a retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Portrait Gallery in London if they did not turn down a gift of £1 million from the Sacklers. The gallery subsequently said it would not proceed with the donation.\\nTwo days after the National Portrait Gallery statement, the Tate group of British art galleries (Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool) announced it would no longer accept any gifts offered by members of the Sackler family, from whom it had received £4m. Tate Modern had been planning to display its copy of Goldin\\'s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency slideshow, for a year from April 15, 2019. Goldin had not discussed the show with Tate.\\nGoldin identified that Tate, which has received Sackler money, paid her for one of the ten copies of The Ballad of Sexual Dependency in 2015, when she was deeply addicted to OxyContin. She says she spent some of the money on buying black market OxyContin, as doctors would no longer prescribe her the drug.\\nIn July 2019, Goldin and others from the group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a protest in the fountain at the Louvre in Paris. The protest was to try to persuade the museum to change the name of its Sackler wing, which is made up of 12 rooms.\\nIn November 2019, Goldin campaigned at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\\nSome critics have accused Goldin of making heroin use appear glamorous and of pioneering a grunge style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as The Face and I-D. However, in a 2002 interview with The Observer, Goldin herself called the use of \"heroin chic\" to sell clothes and perfumes \"reprehensible and evil.\" Goldin admits to having a romanticized image of drug culture at a young age, but she soon saw the error in this ideal: \"I had a totally romantic notion of being a junkie. I wanted to be one.\" Goldin\\'s substance usage stopped after she became intrigued with the idea of memory in her work, \"When people talk about the immediacy in my work, that\\'s what its about: this need to remember and record every single thing\"\\nGoldin\\'s interest in drugs stemmed from a sort of rebellion against parental guidance that parallels her decision to run away from home at a young age, \"I wanted to get high from a really early age. I wanted to be a junkie. That\\'s what intrigues me. Part was the Velvet Underground and the Beats and all that stuff. But, really, I wanted to be as different from my mother as I could and define myself as far as possible from the suburban life I was brought up in.\"\\nGoldin denies the role of voyeur; she is instead a queer insider sharing the same experiences as her subjects: \"I\\'m not crashing; this is my party. This is my family, my history.\" She insists her subjects have veto power over what she exhibits. In Fantastic Tales Liz Kotz criticizes Goldin\\'s claim that she is just as much a part of what she is photographing rather than exploiting her subjects. Goldin\\'s insistence on intimacy between artist and subject is an attempt to relegitimize the codes and conventions of social documentary, presumably by ridding them of their problematic enmeshment with the histories of social surveillance and coercion, says Kotz. [Her] insider status does nothing to alter the way her pictures convert her audience into voyeurs.\\nGoldin\\'s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency critiques gender norms (\"clichés\" as she calls them) by highlighting the collective human desire to form connections regardless of the emotional or physical cost. Throughout Ballad, Goldin showcases some difficult moments for both herself and her friends, especially in relation to their codependency in search of genuine connection. Her friends are a diverse cast consisting of many non-conforming gender identities and sexualities; Goldin\\'s photography exposes many narratives that most would turn a blind eye to, such as the  intense intimacy and pain of same-sex relationships. The AIDS epidemic cost most of Goldin\\'s friends their lives, now preserved in time through the photos that she captured of them. Throughout this period of loss, the desire for connection was further perpetuated and Goldin and her remaining friend group found it essential to remain in close contact with one another. This constant desire for intimacy and connection highlights the similarities amongst people, despite their more obvious differences, emphasizing the societally upheld \"differences\" between men and women.\\nIn November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, hundreds of members and supporters of Jewish Voice for Peace–New York City (JVP-NYC) took part in a sit-in protest in front of New York\\'s Statue of Liberty demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Goldin addressed the demonstration, saying, \"As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us.\" Goldin also canceled a photo shoot with the New York Times Magazine due to concerns about the New York Times\\' reporting on the Gaza crisis, accusing the newspaper of complicity with Israel in its reporting and further questioning its handling of Palestinian perspectives.\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship ===\\nAn exhibition of Goldin\\'s work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature. The main reason was that some of the photographs contained children in bed with their parents, who are naked and caressing each other. In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography.\\nThe sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin\\'s work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nAugust Sander, Peter Hujar, Larry Clark, David Wojnarowicz, and Claude Cahun are all major influences to Goldin\\'s work. \\n\\n\\n=== Diane Arbus ===\\nBoth Goldin and Diane Arbus celebrate those who live marginal lives. Stills from Variety are compared to Arbus\\' magazine work; the Variety series portray \"the rich collision of music, club life, and art production of the Lower East Side pre and post AIDS period\". Both artists ask to reexamine artists\\' intentionality. \\n\\n\\n=== Michelangelo Antonioni ===\\nOne of the reasons Goldin began photographing was Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s Blow Up (1966). The sexuality and glamour of the film exerted a \"huge effect\" on her. Referring to images shown in Ballad, \"the beaten down and beaten up personages, with their gritty, disheveled miens, which populate these early pictures, often photographed in the dark and dank, ramshackle interiors, relate physically and emotionally to the alienated and marginal character types that attracted Antonioni.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Larry Clark ===\\nThe youths in Larry Clark\\'s Tulsa (1971) presented a striking contrast to any wholesome, down-home stereotype of the heartland that captured the collective American imagination. He turned the camera on himself and his lowlife amphetamine-shooting board of hanger-ons. Goldin would adopt Clark\\'s approach to image-making.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books by Goldin ===\\nThe Ballad of Sexual Dependency. New York: Aperture, 1986.

Artists represented included David Armstrong, Tom Chesley, Dorit Cypis, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Jane Dickson, Darrel Ellis, Allen Frame, Peter Hujar, Greer Lankton, Siobhan Liddel, Mark Morrisroe, James Nares, Perico Pastor, Margo Pelletier, Clarence Elie-Rivera, Vittorio Scarpati, Jo Shane, Kiki Smith, Janet Stein, Stephen Tashjian, Shellburne Thurber, Ken Tisa, and David Wojnarowicz. Goldin noted that artists\\' works varied in response, as \"out of loss comes memory pieces, tributes to friends and lovers who have died; out of anger comes explorations of the political cause and effects of the disease.\"\\nDavid Wojnarowicz\\'s essay \"Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell\" in the exhibition\\'s catalogue criticized conservative legislation that Wojnarowicz believed would increase the spread of HIV by discouraging safe sex education. Additionally, Wojnarowicz speaks about the efficacy of making the private public via the model of outing, as he and Goldin believed empowerment begins through self-disclosure. Embracing personal identities then becomes a political statement that disrupts oppressive rules of behavior of bourgeois society – though Wojnarowicz does admit outing may lock a subject into a single frozen identity. Goldin\\'s show, and in particular Wojnarowicz\\'s essay, was met with criticism, leading to the National Endowment of Arts rescinding its support for the publication.\\n\\n\\n=== From Desire: A Queer Diary ===\\nGoldin\\'s second curated show, From Desire: A Queer Diary (March 29 – April 19, 1991), was held at the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery at St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY. Artists who were exhibited included David Armstrong, Eve Ashcraft, Kathryn Clark, Joyce Culver, Zoe Leonard, Simon Leung, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Windrum, and David Wojnarowicz.\\n\\n\\n=== Nan\\'s Guests ===\\nRencontres d\\'Arles festival, Arles, France. This included the work of thirteen photographers including Antoine d\\'Agata, David Armstrong, JH Engström, Jim Goldberg, Leigh Ledare, Boris Mikhailov, Anders Petersen and Annelies Strba.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNan Goldin on Instagram\\nNan Goldin at theCollectiveShift',\n",
              "  'NEVERCREW is a Swiss street art group composed of Christian Rebecchi (born 1980) and Pablo Togni (born 1979). NEVERCREW create large format murals, installations and urban interventions that emerge from their analysis of the relationship between humankind and nature.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe group was founded in 1996 by Christian Rebecchi and Pablo Togni while they were both students in the art school in Lugano, Switzerland. Following this, they attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan. They went on to realize public artworks worldwide in Grenoble, New Delhi, Manchester, Torino, Lucerne, Vancouver, Cairo, Aalborg, Rochester, Miami, Satka, Kyiv, Los Angeles and Phoenix.\\nThey were awarded by the Bally Cultural Foundation as \"artists of the year 2012\" and they were included in Graffiti Art Magazine\\'s  100 most influent urban artists of the year in \"The Urban Contemporary Art Guide 2015\".\\n\\n\\n== Style and contents ==\\nAccording to Julien Vittores, on Graffiti Art Magazine issue #28 (2016), Nevercrew\\'s style is based on their mutual communication as duo. They work on the concept of \"comparison\" and in fact it\\'s through comparison that they graphically and conceptually express their thoughts about humankind condition and about the relationship mankind has with the natural environment.\\nNevercrew\\'s work ranges from mural painting to installation, sculpture and small format paintings, including hyperrealistic subjects, graphical elements, site specific interactions, often mixed together. The concept of their artworks is related to environmental and social issues, with a tendency towards a wider vision of the human condition and human attitudes. Their subjects are natural and mechanical, put in a terse confrontation between them within the space in which the artworks are realized.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==']}"
