She is a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Rome Tor Vergata.\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nTarantello was born in Pratola Peligna. She did her undergraduate studies at the University of L'Aquila, earning a bachelor's degree there in 1982. She then came to New York University for graduate study at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, earning a master's degree in 1984 and completing her Ph.D. there in 1986. Her dissertation, Some Results on the Minimal Period Problem for Nonlinear Vibrating Strings and Hamiltonian Systems; and on the Number of Solutions for Semilinear Elliptic Equations, was supervised by Louis Nirenberg.\nAfter postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Study and a visiting assistant professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, she joined the Carnegie Mellon University faculty in 1989.\nShe returned to Italy as an associate professor at Tor Vergata in 1993, moved to the University of Basilicata as a full professor in 1994, and returned to Tor Vergata as a full professor in 1995.\n\n\n== Books ==\nTarantello is the author of the book Selfdual Gauge Field Vortices: An Analytical Approach (Progress in Nonlinear Differential Equations and Their Applications 72, Birkh\u00e4user, 2008). With Matthew J. Gursky, Ermanno Lanconelli, Andrea Malchiodi, and Paul C. Yang, she is a co-author of Geometric Analysis and PDEs: Lectures given at the C.I.M.E. Summer School held in Cetraro, Italy, June 11\u201316, 2007 (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1977, Springer, 2009).\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2014, Tarantello won the Lucio & Wanda Amerio Gold Medal Prize of the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere.\nShe became a member of the Academia Europaea in 2020.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page\nGabriella Tarantello publications indexed by Google Scholar", "Mary Elizabeth Flahive (born 1948) is a professor of mathematics at Oregon State University. Her research interests are in number theory;\nshe is the author of two books on difference equations and Diophantine approximation, and is also interested in the geometry of numbers and algebraic coding theory.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFlahive graduated from St. Joseph's College in New York in 1969.\nShe completed her Ph.D. at the Ohio State University in 1976. Her dissertation, On The Minima Of Indefinite Binary Quadratic Forms, was supervised by Alan C. Woods, and cites the mentorship of another Ohio State mathematician, Jill Yaqub. She published it under the name Mary Flahive Gbur, and some of her journal papers from this period use the name Mary E.

Cusick, Mathematical Surveys and Monographs 30, American Mathematical Society, 1989). She is also the author of an undergraduate textbook on difference equations, Difference Equations: From Rabbits to Chaos (with Paul Cull and Robby Robson, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 2005).\n\n\n== Activism ==\nFlahive has also been active in the promotion of women in mathematics. She served a five-year term on the Joint Committee On Women In the Mathematical Sciences from 1996 to 2000. With Marie A. Vitulli, she wrote an influential study on patterns of job offers to women with new U.S. Ph.D.s in 1997, and updated the study in 2010. The major differences that both studies found were that, at academic institutions whose highest degree in mathematics is a bachelor's degree, women were initially employed  at a substantially higher rate than men, and in business and industry men were initially employed at a considerably higher rate than women. Their study found small differences in hiring at doctorate-granting institutions between men and women, indicating that other points in the career are more critical in explaining the gender gap between men and women in mathematics.\n\n\n== References ==", "Claudia Zaslavsky (January 12, 1917 \u2013 January 13, 2006) was an American mathematics teacher and ethnomathematician. \n\n\n== Life ==\nShe was born Claudia Natoma Cohen (later changed to Cogan) on January 12, 1917, in Upper Manhattan in New York City and grew up in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

Her field work on a trip to East Africa in 1970 was assisted by the photography of her husband Sam and travel guidance from her son Alan, then teaching in Kenya.\nZaslavsky wrote the book Africa Counts about mathematics in African culture to sum up her discoveries up to that time. \nHer work was welcomed into the burgeoning field of ethnomathematics, which studies the ways in which mathematical concepts are expressed and used by people in diverse cultures in the course of everyday life. As she wrote, \"scholars of ethnomathematics examine the practice of mathematics from an anthropological point of view.\"\nZaslavsky was a lifelong activist for civil rights, peace and social justice. She also mentored many new scholars and activists in the field of ethnomathematics, always remembering the importance of discovering and recognizing the mathematical accomplishments of groups currently underrepresented, including women. As a Jew, Zaslavsky had experienced her own struggles with discrimination against women and Jewish people during her formative years in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nOne of her children, Alan Zaslavsky, became a teacher in Kenya, a progressive activist, and later a statistician.

She was the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Chicago, and became Clark Professor of Mathematics at Oberlin College.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSinclair was born on September 27, 1878, in Worcester, Massachusetts; she was the fourth of five children of John Elbridge Sinclair and Marietta S. Fletcher Sinclair. Her father was a mathematics professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and also had two daughters from an earlier marriage. Her mother, originally from Worcester, taught English and modern languages at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute but stopped when her children were born. After graduating in 1896 from the Worcester Classical High School, Mary Emily Sinclair became a student at Oberlin, and as a student served as president of the Oberlin branch of the YWCA. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1900 with an A.B.\nWhile working as a teacher at a seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, Sinclair continued her studies through the University of Chicago, earning a master's degree in mathematics in 1903. After briefly teaching at Lake Erie College in 1903, she taught at the University of Nebraska from 1904 through 1907, while continuing her graduate study at the University of Chicago. She completed her Ph.D. in 1908, with the dissertation On a Compound Discontinuous Solution Connected with the Surface of Revolution of Minimum Area in the calculus of variations, supervised by Oskar Bolza. She became the first woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics at the University of Chicago, and her doctorate marked the beginning of a period in which the university gave over 50 doctorates to women through 1946, likely the most of any American university.\n\n\n== Career and later life ==\nMeanwhile, in 1907, Sinclair had taken a position as instructor at Oberlin College, where she would remain for the rest of her career, teaching there for 37 years. The next year, on receiving her doctorate, she was promoted to associate professor. Although unmarried, she adopted two children as infants in 1914 and 1915. Also in 1915, she became one of the founding members of the Mathematical Association of America. She was promoted to professor in 1925, and became head of the mathematics department at Oberlin in 1939. In 1941 she was named Clark Professor of Mathematics. She retired in 1944, but continued to teach mathematics to US Navy students for two more years through Berea College.\nShe returned to Oberlin in 1947, but was heavily injured in a carjacking incident in 1950. She moved to Belfast, Maine, in 1953, living there with her daughter-in-law, and died there on June 3, 1955.\n\n\n== Sinclair's discriminant surface ==\nSinclair's 1903 master's thesis was Concerning the discriminantal surface for the quintic in the normal form: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          u\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        +\n        10\n        x\n        \n          u\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        +\n        5\n        y\n        u\n        +\n        z\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u^{5}+10xu^{3}+5yu+z=0}\n  \n.\nIn it, she uses Tschirnhaus transformations to put quintic functions with real coefficients into the form given in the title, and uses the discriminant, a polynomial of the coefficients \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        z\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle z}\n  \n, to classify polynomials of this form by their numbers of real roots.

Morawetz's research was mainly in the study of the partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow. She was professor emerita at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the New York University, where she had also served as director from 1984 to 1988.

Her mother also studied mathematics for a time. Her uncle was Edward Hutchinson Synge who is credited as the inventor of the Near-field scanning optical microscope and very large astronomical telescopes, based on multiple mirrors.\nHer childhood was split between Ireland and Canada. Both her parents were supportive of her interest in mathematics and science, and it was a woman mathematician, Cecilia Krieger, who had been a family friend for many years and later encouraged Morawetz to pursue a PhD in mathematics. Morawetz said her father was influential in stimulating her interest in mathematics, but he wondered whether her studying mathematics would be wise (suggesting they might fight like the Bernoulli brothers).\n\n\n== Education ==\nA 1945 graduate of the University of Toronto, she married Herbert Morawetz, a chemist, on October 28, 1945. She received her master's degree in 1946 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Morawetz got a job at New York University where she edited Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves by Richard Courant and Kurt Otto Friedrichs. She earned her Ph.D. in 1951 at New York University, with a thesis on the stability of a spherical implosion, under the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs. Her thesis was entitled Contracting Spherical Shocks Treated by a Perturbation Method\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter earning her doctorate, she spent a year as a research associate at MIT before returning to work as a research associate at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, for five more years. During this time she had no teaching requirements and could focus purely on research. She published work on a variety of topics in applied mathematics including viscosity, compressible fluids and transonic flows. Even if an aircraft remains subsonic, the air flowing around the wing can reach supersonic velocity. The mix of air at supersonic and subsonic velocity creates shock waves that can slow the airplane.\nTurning to the mathematics of transonic flow, she showed that specially designed shockless airfoils could not, in fact, prevent shocks.  Shocks developed in response to even small perturbations, such as a gust of wind or an imperfection in a wing. This discovery opened up the problem of developing a theory for a flow with shocks. Subsequently, the shocks she predicted mathematically now have been observed in experiments as air flows around the wing of a plane.\nIn 1957 she became an assistant professor at Courant.  At this point she began to work more closely with her colleagues publishing important joint papers with Peter Lax and Ralph Phillips on the decay of solutions to the wave equation around a star shaped obstacle. She continued with important solo work on the wave equation and transonic flow around a profile until she was promoted to full professor by 1965.\nAt this point her research expanded to a variety of problems including papers on the Tricomi equation the nonrelativistic wave equation including questions of decay and scattering. Her first doctoral student, Lesley Sibner, was graduated in 1964. In the 1970s she worked on questions of scattering theory and the nonlinear wave equation. She proved what is now known as the Morawetz Inequality. She died on August 8, 2017, in New York City.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nIn 1980, Morawetz won a Lester R. Ford Award. In 1981, she became the first woman to deliver the Gibbs Lecture of The American Mathematical Society, and in 1982 presented an Invited Address at a meeting of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. She received honorary degrees from Eastern Michigan University in 1980, Brown University, and Smith College in 1982, and Princeton in 1990. In 1983 and in 1988, she was selected as a Noether Lecturer. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984. She was named Outstanding Woman Scientist for 1993 by the Association for Women in Science. In 1995, she became the second woman elected to the office of president of the American Mathematical Society. \nIn 1996, she was awarded an honorary ScD degree by Trinity College Dublin, where her father JL Synge had been a student and later a faculty member. That same year, she was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1998 she was awarded the National Medal of Science; she was the first woman to receive the medal for work in mathematics. In 2004, she received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement. In 2006, she won the George David Birkhoff Prize in Applied Mathematics.

She gave the name to Schur complements and is the namesake of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula. She was known for the \"absolute originality\" of her mathematical formulations, her \"strong and independent mind\", her \"fine sense of mathematical elegance\", and her \"strong mixture of the traditional and unconventional\".\n\n\n== Education and career ==\nHaynsworth was born and died in Sumter, South Carolina. She competed in mathematics at the statewide level in junior high school, and graduated in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Coker College. She earned a master's degree in 1939 from Columbia University in New York City, and became a high school mathematics teacher. As part of the war effort for World War II, she left teaching to work at the Aberdeen Proving Ground; after the war, she became a lecturer at an extension program of the University of Illinois in Galesburg, Illinois.\nShe began her doctoral studies at Columbia University in 1948, but soon transferred to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she completed her doctorate in 1952. Her dissertation, Bounds for Determinants with Dominant Main Diagonal, was supervised by Alfred Brauer.\nIn 1951, Haynsworth took a faculty position at Wilson College (Pennsylvania). She moved to the National Bureau of Standards in 1955, and returned to academia in 1960 as a faculty member in mathematics at Auburn University. According to Haynsworth, the interview with department chair William Vann Parker at which she was offered the job consisted entirely of working on a research problem in linear algebra with Parker.\nAt Auburn, Haynsworth eventually became the doctoral advisor to 17 graduate students. She was named a research professor in 1965, and chaired the Southeastern Section of the Mathematical Association of America for 1976\u20131977. She retired in 1983.\n\n\n== Research ==\nHaynsworth's early research, including her dissertation, concerned the determinants of diagonally dominant matrices, and variants of the Gershgorin circle theorem for bounding the locations of the eigenvalues of matrices. Her later work involved cones of matrices.\nIt is for two works that she published in 1968 that Haynsworth is particularly known. One of these identified and named the Schur complement, a concept that Haynsworth had already been using in her own work since 1959. In a second paper in 1968 she used this concept to prove what is now known as the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula. This formula provides a decomposition of the triple of numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a matrix into a sum of the triples defined in the same way for a block and its Schur complement in a partitioned Hermitian matrix.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDavis, Philip J.

She attended the lyc\u00e9e in Tarbes, the nearest town large enough for that level of school, and then spent two years in a preparatory mathematics course for entrance to the grandes \u00e9coles in Toulouse, where her sister worked as a teacher.\nShe became a student at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1965. Her instructors included Gustave Choquet, Henri Cartan, and Laurent Schwartz. After her son was born in 1967, her mother came to live with her in Paris to help take care of him. At approximately the same time, she became interested in model theory through a book by Georg Kreisel and Jean-Louis Krivine. She took part in a student protest in 1968, part of the May 1968 events in France, in which most of the students refused to take the oral part of the agr\u00e9gation exam, but their resistance to the exam did not last and she completed her agr\u00e9gation in 1969.\nFollowing this she became a student at the University of Paris, studying mathematical logic, and when it split into multiple universities in 1970 she chose to go to Paris Diderot University. She completed her doctorate there in 1972.\n\n\n== Career ==\nWhile still a doctoral student, Artigue became a faculty member at what would become Paris Diderot University in 1969. In part as fallout from the student protests, in the same year, the Institute of Research in Mathematics Education (IREM) was founded at the university, with Andr\u00e9 Revuz as its director, and Revuz invited Artigue to become one of its members. Through her involvement with the institute, her interests shifted from logic to mathematics education.\nArtigue directed IREM from 1985 to 1988. She then moved to the University Institute for Teacher Education of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, where she took a full professorship and became head of the mathematics department. She returned to Paris Diderot University and to the directorship of IREM in 1999, and retired as an emeritus professor in 2010.\nShe also served as president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\n== Research ==\nArtigue's early work in mathematics education focused on derivatives and integrals and on the graphical representation of functions. Later, she became interested in educational technology and its integration into the teaching of mathematics. Her research also included work on pedagogical theory.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nArtigue was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians twice, in 1998 and 2006.\nIn 2012, her collaborators organized a conference in her honor in Paris, and a festschrift from the conference, The Didactics of Mathematics: Approaches and Issues: A Homage to Mich\u00e8le Artigue, was published in 2016.\nArtigue won the F\u00e9lix Klein medal of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction in 2013.

Lax received a bachelor's degree in 1942 from Adelphi University and her doctorate in 1956. She was a professor of mathematics at New York University's Courant Institute. She was married to the mathematician Peter Lax.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Career ===\nIn 1942, she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics at Adelphi University in Long Island. In 1956, she earned a PhD from New York University with the dissertation Cauchy's Problem for a Partial Differential Equation with Real Multiple Characteristics with thesis adviser Richard Courant.\nShe became a mathematics professor at NYU and was the editor of the Mathematics Association of America's New Mathematical Library Series.\nIn 1961, the series started, with 36 published volumes by 1995. It was planned, by Professor Lax and others, to make mathematics accessible to the average reader while still being technically accurate. The first two books were, Numbers: Rational and Irrational by Ivan Niven and What Is Calculus About? by W. W. Sawyer.\nIn 1977, she won the George P\u00f3lya Award for her article: Linear Algebra, A Potent Tool, Vol. 7 (1976), 3\u201315. In 1980, the mathematics department of New York University assigned Lax to design a remedial course in mathematics for freshmen. The course she devised and called \"Mathematical Thinking\" presented mathematics not as a body of facts but as a set of problems to be analyzed and resolved.\n\"There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about the nature of mathematics\", she said, in a 1979 interview. \"They consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of thinking.\" The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.\nShe teamed up with John Devine, working with teachers in inner-city New York schools. Together they got funding from the Ford Foundation to train teachers from these schools in the methods Lax had pioneered at New York University.\nThough she was involved with reforming mathematics education for high school and college students in New York, she didn't like panel discussions at conferences, especially when she was meant to reply immediately to preceding remarks by fellow panelists. Anneli said she was a slow listener and reader. She believed her responses were \u201cnot ready for public consumption when my turn comes.\u201d\nAn insert from her writing at the Mathematics as a Humanistic Discipline Session stated:\n\"I am convinced that the use of language- reading, writing, listening and speaking is essential part of learning anything, and especially mathematics.\" \nAnneli knew from her experience as teacher, that students learn new material easily when they are able to connect to their past experiences or the outside world. She looked at the mandated syllabi from 6th-8th grade New York middle schools for \u201cintegrated math sequences\u201d and she found that because so many topics covered, there was little time for students to connect mathematics outside of the classroom before they were tested.\nA keystone in Lax's work of reforming education was the emphasis on listening. She taught pre-calculus classes by asking her students to explain the meaning behind exponential functions orally and written accounts of how they solved the problem. She believed listening to the students\u2019 ideas would improve students\u2019 performance and attitude about mathematics.\nShe was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. In 1993, one of the last projects Lax worked on with her husband was the Parent's Guide. Parent's Guide constructed a basic mathematics list for adults to use to help their children with their schoolwork.\nIn 1995, the Mathematical Association of America awarded Lax its highest recognition, the Gung-Hu Award for Distinguished Service, for her contributions to mathematical publishing and education in a broad sense.\nIn 1998, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Anneli Cahn died on September 24, 1999, at the age of 77.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nIn 1948, Anneli Cahn married her second husband, the mathematician Peter Lax. Anneli Cahn had two sons, John Lax and James Lax. The John Lax Memorial Lecture was created in 1982 by Anneli and Peter, in memory of their son, who taught at Mount Holyoke and died at the age of 27. The Lax Lecture is given by a historian of the highest distinction to commemorate the work and spirit of John Lax by making the latest advances in history accessible to the public.

After the Bolsheviks took control of Georgia, the family lived in Austria from 1922 to 1924, for a brief period in 1924 in Berlin, and finally moved to Langenhorn, Hamburg, where they remained until 1937. Natascha Jasny attended the progressive Lichtwark school. While still in school, she photographed with a simple box camera and processed her own pictures in the bathroom at home, which served as a makeshift darkroom.\nNatascha graduated in 1928. She hoped to study architecture at the Bauhaus Dessau, but the family's financial situation made this impossible. She instead studied mathematics at the University of Hamburg, where she also took courses in art history from Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky. She graduated from the university in 1930 with a Magister degree.\nOn August 29, 1929 she married her mathematics professor Emil Artin, who had been teaching in Hamburg since 1923. In 1933, the Artins had a daughter, Karin, and in 1934 a son, Michael.\nBecause his wife was of Jewish descent, Emil Artin was forced into early retirement from his teaching position under the Nazi Party Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. On September 27, 1934, Artin already had to sign a declaration that his wife was not \"Aryan\". The Artin family managed to leave Germany for the United States on October 21, 1937. Since they were prohibited from taking larger sums of money with them, the Artins shipped their entire household, which reflected their modernist sensibilities.\n\n\n== Life in the United States ==\nNatascha's husband first obtained a teaching position at the University of Notre Dame, and in 1938 moved to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. The Artins had their third child, son Thomas (Tom), in 1938. During World War II, Natascha Artin was classified an enemy alien. The United States Army nevertheless hired her in 1942 to teach Russian to soldiers under Army Specialized Training Program at Indiana University.\nIn 1946, Emil was hired by Princeton University, and the Artins moved to Princeton, New Jersey. They divorced in 1958, after which Emil Artin returned to Hamburg. Natasha Artin remarried in 1960. Her second husband was composer Mark Brunswick.\nShe lived in Princeton until her death in 2003.\n\n\n== Work as a mathematics editor ==\nAfter her move to Princeton, Natascha Artin joined the group around Richard Courant at the mathematics department of New York University. She became the technical editor of the journal Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, founded at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1948, and in 1956 became the primary translation editor for the journal Theory of Probability and Its Applications, a position she held until 1989. In recognition of her long-standing membership of over 50 years, she was made an Honorary Member of the American Mathematical Society.\n\n\n== Work as photographer ==\nArtin Brunswick never saw herself as a professional photographer. She considered it a \"private passion, nevertheless, it was a bit more than just taking snapshots.\"\nAfter they married in 1929, Emil Artin, who shared her passion for photography, presented her as a gift a precious Leica compact camera. She was encouraged in her photography by the painter Heinrich Stegemann, a family friend. She first took pictures of family members, friends, and landscapes, but later explored Hamburg and photographed scenes such as the Port of Hamburg, the Jungfernstieg, and the main railway station. She was particularly interested in architecture, and, influenced by the ideas of the Bauhaus, preferred clear, bright lines in her photographs.\nAs she was classified an enemy alien during World War II, her camera was provisionally confiscated by police in 1942. By the time it was returned to her, she had lost her passion for photography. Her prints from the time in Hamburg, however, survived through her emigration. Her son Tom rediscovered them about forty years later in a cabinet.  He recognized their importance and contacted galleries in Hamburg. Artin Brunswick's photographs were first shown at the Kunstgenuss gallery in Hamburg-Eppendorf in 1999.  In 2001, the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe organized an exhibition of 227 original prints under the title Hamburg, As I Saw It. Photographs from the 1920s and 30s. Despite her advanced age of 91 years, Natascha Brunswick took the trip from New York to attend the opening. The museum now holds 230 original prints; the negatives are in the possession of the Artin family.\n\n\n== References ==", "Karen Amanda Yeats (born 1980) is a Canadian mathematician and mathematical physicist whose research connects combinatorics to quantum field theory.

Although born in Lebanon, Hatoum was ineligible for a Lebanese identity card and does not identify as Lebanese. As she grew up, her family did not support her desire to pursue art. She continued to draw throughout her childhood, though, illustrating her work from poetry and science classes.\nHatoum studied graphic design at Beirut University College in Lebanon for two years and then began working at an advertising agency. Hatoum was displeased with the advertising work she produced. During a visit to London in 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out and Hatoum was forced into exile.\nShe stayed in London, training at both the Byam Shaw School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art (University College, London) between the years 1975 and 1981. In the years since, \"she has traveled extensively and developed a dynamic art practice that explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity, and being an outsider.\"\n\n\n== Artwork and themes ==\nHatoum explores a variety of different subject matter via different theoretical frameworks. Her work can be interpreted as a description of the body, as a commentary on politics, and on gender and difference as she explores the dangers and confines of the domestic world. Her work can also be interpreted through the concept of space as her sculpture and installation work depend on the viewer to inhabit the surrounding space to complete the effect. There are always multiple readings to her work. The physical responses that Hatoum desired to provoke psychological and emotional responses ensures unique and individual reactions from different viewers.\n\n\n=== Early work ===\nHatoum's early work consisted largely of performance pieces that used a direct physical confrontation with an audience to make a political point. She used this technique as a means of making a direct statement using her own body; the performances often referenced her background and the political situation in Palestine. In her work, she addressed the vulnerability of the individual in relation to the violence inherent in institutional power structures. Her primary point of reference was the human body, sometimes using her own body.\nOne such example was in her 1985 work, Roadworks, in which Hatoum walked barefoot through the streets of Brixton, with black boots tied behind her ankles, a statement on the surveillance and policing of the predominantly-Afro-Caribbean population after the 1981 Brixton riot/uprising and the 1985 Brixton riot/uprising. About this work, she writes: \u2018I found myself in this rare situation of creating work which although personal/autobiographical, had an immediate relevance to the community of people it was addressing. I also found that I was working \u2018for\u2019 the people in the streets of Brixton rather than \u2018against\u2019 the indifferent, often hostile audience I usually encounter.\u2019 Roadworks was curated as part of the 2023 Women in Revolt Exhibition at Tate Modern. \n\n\n=== Measures of Distance ===\nCreated in 1988 as a result of a residency at Western Front in Vancouver, Measures of Distance illustrates Hatoum's early themes of family, displacement, and female sexuality.  The video piece itself is fifteen minutes long and consists of intimate, colored photographs of Hatoum's mother showering. Hatoum overlays the photographs with letters that her mother, living in Beirut during the civil war, wrote to Hatoum, living in London. Handwritten in Arabic, the letters make up the video's narration and themes, and speak to the difficulty of sending letters in a time of conflict. Hatoum reads the letters aloud in Arabic and English. The video roots itself in the brief family reunion that occurred in Beirut between Hatoum and her parents in 1981. While primarily about the mother\u2013daughter relationship, in her mother's letters Hatoum's father is mentioned and thus the father\u2013daughter relationship as well as the husband\u2013wife relationship is examined in this video.\nThe elements of the video\u2014the letters, Hatoum's mother's wish to see her, and mentions of the war by Hatoum's mother\u2014explore how the war in Palestine and the war in Lebanon displaced the identity and the relationships of Hatoum and her family. The video is neither a documentary nor meant to be journalistic. The video critiques stereotypes and remains optimistic, since the narration from the letters is largely positive, except about the distance between the mother and the daughter. Hatoum attempts to recreate the moments when she reunited with her mother in Beirut and when she asked to photograph her in the shower. Instead of directly depicting the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict or the Lebanese Civil War, Hatoum shows how the conflicts affected her family's relationships and her identity. Hatoum both distances and draws in Western audiences through her narration in English and Arabic.\nIn this portrait of a Palestinian woman, Hatoum gives her mother a voice while subverting stereotypes about Arab women. The Tate Modern describes the portrait in the following words: \"It is through the daughter's art-making project that the mother is able to present herself freely, in a form which cements a bond of identity independent of colonial and patriarchal concerns.\" Measures of Distance is one of the few works done by Hatoum that speaks directly to her background. In other works, Hatoum prefers to be more abstract and to leave the work open ended. While not as abstract as many of her other works, the viewer is still forced to work through how to understand the formal elements of the video. They are not easily given by Hatoum, as the narration is here. \"The video transmits the 'paradoxical state of geographical distance and emotional closeness.'\" It underscores her sense of exile and separation caused by war.\nMeasures of Distance was screened at the London Film Festival, AFI National Video Festival, and the Montreal Women's Film and Video Festival.\n\n\n=== Grater Divide ===\nMade in 2002, Grater Divide transforms an everyday object, in this case a common kitchen grater, into a 80 in \u00d7 76 in \u00d7 33 in (203 cm \u00d7 193 cm \u00d7 84 cm) divider, alluding to political alienation, perhaps caused by Israeli-built walls in Palestinian territory.\n\n\n=== Hot Spot III ===\nHot Spot III, created in 2009, is a large installation piece of the globe tilted like the Earth and about as tall as a person. The title connects to the theme of political unrest, imagining conflict in one geographical area upsetting the whole world. The globe is made of cage-like steel that glows luminescent red, as though the world is ablaze, flickering quickly, meant to create an energetic environment that mesmerizes the audience. The installation also invokes a feeling of danger with the hot red lighting outlining the continents. Hatoum challenges whether minimalist or surrealist forms can adequately address the world's issues.\n\n\n=== Later work ===\n\nIn the late 1980s, Hatoum abandoned performances as politically too direct and instead turned her attention to installations and objects, taking up some of the earlier ideas from her student days at the Slade School of Art in London. From then on, she relied on the kind of interactivity that lets the spectator become involved in the aesthetic experience without making the artist as performer the focus of attention.\nSince the 1990s, her work has generally shifted from making statements to asking questions. Much more is required of the viewer as performances were replaced by sculptures and installations that required a level of mental and physical interactivity. Her practice has shifted towards site specificity in, for instance, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and Kunsthalle Hamburg.\nA notable piece exemplifying her turn from performance to physical objects is Keffieh (1993\u20131999), a scarf woven of human hair that juxtaposes ideas of femininity and religion.\nAt the end of the 1980s, she began to focus on common domestic objects\u2014including kitchen utensils and house furnishings. T42 (1993\u201398) is a pair of teacups fused together at the rim.\n\n\n=== The body ===\nMany of Hatoum's early pieces situate the body as the locus of a network of concerns\u2014political, feminist, and linguistic\u2014thereby eliciting a highly visceral response. One of her pieces, a 1994 video installation called Corps etranger, showed color video images of an endoscopic probe of her body. Corps etranger was originally produced for Centre Georges Pompidou and features a partially enclosed, cylindrical structure that viewers are called to enter. The viewer stands on a circular plate of glass, and video close-up images of internal and external parts of the artist's body. The artist hails the viewer to \"walk around\" the inside of her body through the visual sequence taken on the endoscope and colonoscope, scanning and probing her digestive system. The audio is a recording of a heartbeat and bodily movements.\nThe artwork of Hatoum investigates the concept of the 'abjection' introduced by the cultural theorist, Julia Kristeva and the uncanny in her works using body hair.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nThe political possibilities for the uncanny visual motif are relevant to discussions of Hatoum's work, as the disruption achieved at a psychological level can have broad implications involving power, politics, or individual concerns. The allusiveness attained by her work is not always referencing grand political events, or appealing to a generalized cultural consciousness, but instead to a seemingly unattainable threat that is only possible to address on an individual scale.\nHatoum has tied her works to other political movements, especially black struggle. In an interview with Michael Archer in 1997, Hatoum said: \"At the beginning it was important to think about the black struggle as a total political struggle. There are common political forces and attitudes that discriminate against people. In the same way as feminism started off with this totalizing concept of 'sisterhood', and then we ended up with many feminisms, if you like. The black struggle became more diversified once the basic issues were established. And blackness here is not to do with the colour of your skin but a political stance.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHatoum's work was featured in a solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2015. In May 2016, Tate Modern held a \"comprehensive exploration into 35 years of Hatoum's work in Britain, from her early performance and video works to her sculpture and large-scale installation\" The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas organized a solo exhibition titled \"Mona Hatoum: Terra Infirma\" that was on view from 12 October 2017 to 25 February 2018. This exhibition then traveled to the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and was on view from 6 April to 11 August 2018.\nIn March 2018, Hatoum was shortlisted for the Hepworth Prize for Sculpture, alongside Michael Dean, Phillip Lai, Magali Reus and Cerith Wyn Evans.  In January 2020, Hatoum was part of Artpace\u2019s exhibit titled Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace. Also in 2020, she received the Julio Gonz\u00e1lez award, featuring in a solo exhibition at Institut Valenci\u00e0 d'Art Modern in 2021.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2008 \u2013 Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts\n2011 \u2013 Joan Mir\u00f3 Prize, Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3\n2017 \u2013 10th Hiroshima Art Prize, Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, Hiroshima\n2018 \u2013 Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon\n2019 \u2013 Praemium Imperiale for the sculpture category, in recognition of her lifetime achievement in the medium.\n2021 \u2013 Julio Gonz\u00e1lez Price 2020\n\n\n== See also ==\nPalestinian art\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMichael Archer, Guy Brett, and Catherine M.

She took part in documenta (13) and held performances at  MAXXI, Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa, among other places. In 2016 she won the Premio New York. \nFumai in her performance practice centered her artistic focus on the role of women. Her approach involved a combination of deconstruction methods, exploration of freak shows, engagement with metaphysics, transvestism, and DJ sets. This analysis was conducted through an anarcho-feminist lens, also in relation to the art system.She also exhibited under the pseudonym Nico Fumai, a fictitious character inspired by her father\nIn 2019 her works were exhibited in the Italian Pavilion on the occasion of the 58th International Art Exhibition of the Venice Biennale. Her work was the subject of a solo show at the Centre d\u2019Art Contemporain Gen\u00e8ve in 2020.\n\n\n== Death and commemoration ==\nChiara Fumai committed suicide on 16 August 2017, at the age of 39.\nHer archives are held in the Castello di Rivoli in Turin.

In the 1980s, he received international attention for his \"plate paintings\" \u2014 with broken ceramic plates set onto large-scale paintings. Since the 1990s, he has been a proponent of independent arthouse cinema. Schnabel directed Before Night Falls, which became Javier Bardem's breakthrough Academy Award-nominated role, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was nominated for four Academy Awards. For the latter, he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as receiving nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nSchnabel was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family, the son of Esta (n\u00e9e Greenberg) and Jack Schnabel. He moved with his family to Brownsville, Texas in 1965. He received his B.F.A. at the University of Houston. After graduating, he sent an application to the Independent Study Program (ISP) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. His application included slides of his work sandwiched between two pieces of bread. He was admitted into the program and studied there from 1973 to 1975.\nIn 1975, Schnabel visited Galveston and was introduced to the artist Joseph Glasco who had his home and studio in Galveston at that time.  Schnabel and Glasco became close friends and shared many similar interests in the arts. Later in their relationship, Schnabel influenced Glasco to set up his studio in New York, and in the late 1980s introduced Glasco to Leslie Waddington of Waddington Galleries, London where he had an exhibition.\n\n\n=== Art career ===\nSchnabel returned to Houston in 1975 and rented a studio in the Heights neighborhood. Jim Harithas, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, agreed to give him a show after Schnabel reportedly badgered him repeatedly. The eponymously titled exhibit ran from February 20 to March 7, 1976, in the parallelogram building's lower gallery.\nOn seeing the show, ARTnews critic Charlotte Moser wrote, \"Though still formative, Schnabel's paintings possess a palpable presence,\" but found the work \"clearly influenced by post-minimalist artists whose intellectual ideas he might share but whose technical expertise and clarity of vision he has yet to acquire.\"\nIt was with his first solo show, at the Mary Boone Gallery in 1979 that Schnabel had his breakthrough; all his works were sold in advance. He participated at the Venice Biennale in 1980 with Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. By the time he exhibited his work in a show jointly organized by Boone and Leo Castelli in 1981, he had become firmly established and was the youngest artist in the legendary exhibition 'A New Spirit in Painting' in the Royal Academy of Arts. His now famous \"plate paintings\" \u2014 large-scale paintings set on broken ceramic plates\u2014received a boisterous and critical reception from the art world. In 1984, he surprised the art community by moving from working with Mary Boone to exhibit at the Pace Gallery.\nHis wild and expressive works were classed as neo-expressionism by art critics. In the years to follow Schnabel's success on the art market would above all be criticised.\nSchnabel's style is characterised by very large scale paintings. He uses diverse materials such as plaster, wax, photographs, antlers, velvet and ceramics. His paintings make use of canvas, wood, muslin and even surfboards. His paintings often combine abstract and figurative elements. Due to the size, weight, and depth of his works, they are often given sculptural properties.\nIn 2002, Schnabel painted the cover artwork for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' eighth studio album, By the Way. The woman featured on the cover of By the Way is Julian's daughter, Stella Schnabel, who was band member John Frusciante's then-girlfriend.[59] Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: \"My girlfriend's father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn't be offended if we didn't like it, but we loved what he did. He's also given us great covers for all the singles. He's a true artist.\"\nSchnabel had an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which ran from September 1, 2010 to January 2, 2011 and occupied the entirety of the gallery's fifth floor. It examined \"the rich interplay between Schnabel's paintings and films\". In 2011 Museo Correr exhibited Julian Schnabel: Permanently Becoming and the Architecture of Seeing, a selected survey show of Schnabel's career curated by Norman Rosenthal.\nArt critic Robert Hughes was one of the most outspoken critics of his work; he once stated that \"Schnabel's work is to painting what Stallone's is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals.\" In the 2017 Swedish film The Square, set in a museum of modern art, Dominic West plays a character modeled on Schnabel.\n\n\n=== Film career ===\nSchnabel began his film career in the 1990s with the film Basquiat, a biopic on the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat (1996), followed by Before Night Falls (2000), an adaptation of Reinaldo Arenas' autobiographical novel, which he also produced, and which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), an adaptation (with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood) of a French memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly earned him the award for best director at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Globe for best director, the Independent Spirit Award for best director, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nDespite the fact that producing The Diving Bell and the Butterfly might seem like a commission to do someone else's work, Schnabel took on the film. According to Schnabel, I used to go up to read to Fred Hughes, Andy Warhol's business partner, who had multiple sclerosis. And as Fred got worse, he ended up locked inside his body. I had been thinking that I might make a movie about Fred when his nurse, Darren McCormick, gave me Bauby's memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Then, in 2003, when my father was dying, the script arrived from Kennedy. So it didn't feel quite like taking on a commissioned job.\nIn 2007, Schnabel designed Lou Reed's critically acclaimed \"Berlin\" Tour and released Lou Reed's Berlin. In 2010, Schnabel then directed the film Miral. In May 2017, Schnabel announced plans for a film about the painter Vincent van Gogh during his time in Arles and Auvers-sur-Oise, France. The film At Eternity's Gate was released in 2018 and the script was written by Schnabel, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, and Louise Kugelberg. The film stars Willem Dafoe as Van Gogh. Other actors include Mathieu Amalric, Mads Mikkelsen, Niels Arestrup, Oscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Emmanuelle Seigner as \"the woman from Arles\" or L'Arl\u00e9sienne. \nIn September 2023, Schnabel announced plans to direct an adaptation of In the Hand of Dante, based on the book by Nick Tosches. The movie will shoot October 2023 and is set to star Oscar Isaac.\n\n\n=== Writing and recording ===\nSchnabel published his autobiography, CVJ: Nicknames of Maitre D's & Other Excerpts From Life (Random House, New York), in 1987 and released the album Every Silver Lining Has a Cloud on Island Records (Catalog #314-524 111-2) in 1995.\nRecorded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1993, the album features guest musicians including Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Buckethead, and Nicky Skopelitis.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\n\nIn 1980, he married Belgian clothing designer Jacqueline Beaurang. They have three children: two daughters \u2013 Lola, a painter and filmmaker; and Stella, a poet and actress \u2013 and a son, Vito, an art dealer.\nHe has twin sons, Cy and Olmo, with his second wife, Spanish actress Olatz L\u00f3pez Garmendia.\nHis collaboration with Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal, who penned the screenplay and original source novel for Schnabel's film Miral, extended beyond the movie. Schnabel was in a relationship with her from 2007 to 2011.\nSchnabel dated Danish model May Andersen, from whom he parted ways in 2014. They have a son, who was born in June 2013.\nSchnabel lives in New York City with his current wife Louise Kugelberg, a Swedish interior designer. She is also the co-editor and co-writer of At Eternity's Gate. Schnabel maintains studios in New York City and in Montauk at the east end of Long Island. Schnabel resides in a former West Village horse stable that he purchased and converted for residential use, adding five luxury condominiums in the style of a Northern Italian palazzo. It is named the Palazzo Chupi, and it is easy to spot because it is painted pink.\nIn 2009, Schnabel signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2019 Paez Medal of Art, New York City (VAEA).\n\n\n== See also ==\nBruno Bischofberger\nList of artists who created paintings and drawings for use in films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJulian Schnabel at IMDb", "Andy Goldsworthy  (born 25 July 1956) is an English sculptor, photographer, and environmentalist who produces site-specific sculptures and land art situated in natural and urban settings.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGoldsworthy was born in Cheshire on 25 July 1956, the son of Muriel (n\u00e9e Stanger) and F. Allin Goldsworthy (1929\u20132001), a former professor of applied mathematics at the University of Leeds. He grew up on the Harrogate side of Leeds. From the age of 13, he worked on farms as a labourer. He has likened the repetitive quality of farm tasks to the routine of making sculpture: \"A lot of my work is like picking potatoes; you have to get into the rhythm of it.\" He studied fine art at Bradford College of Art from 1974 to 1975 and at Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire) from 1975 to 1978, receiving his BA from the latter.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nAfter leaving college, Goldsworthy lived in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria. He moved to Scotland in 1985, first living in Langholm and then settling a year later in Penpont, where he still resides. It has been said that his gradual drift northwards was \"due to a way of life over which he did not have complete control\", but that contributing factors were opportunities and desires to work in these areas and \"reasons of economy\".\nIn 1993, Goldsworthy received an honorary degree from the University of Bradford. He was an A.D. White Professor-At-Large in Sculpture at Cornell University 2000\u20132006 and 2006\u20132008.\nIn 2003, Goldsworthy produced a commissioned work for the entry courtyard of San Francisco's de Young Museum called \"Drawn Stone\", which echoes San Francisco's frequent earthquakes and their effects. His installation included a giant crack in the pavement that broke off into smaller cracks, and broken limestone, which could be used for benches. The smaller cracks were made with a hammer adding unpredictability to the work as he created it.\n\n\n=== Art process ===\nThe materials used in Goldsworthy's art often include brightly coloured flowers, icicles, leaves, mud, pinecones, snow, stone, twigs, and thorns. He has been quoted as saying, \"I think it's incredibly brave to be working with flowers and leaves and petals. But I have to: I can't edit the materials I work with. My remit is to work with nature as a whole.\"\nRather than interfering in natural processes, his work magnifies existing ones through deliberately minimal intervention in the landscape. Goldsworthy has said \u201cI am reluctant to carve into or break off solid living rock\u2026I feel a difference between large, deep rooted stones and the debris lying at the foot of a cliff, pebbles on a beach\u2026These are loose and unsettled, as if on a journey, and I can work with them in ways I couldn\u2019t with a long resting stone.\u201d Goldsworthy\u2019s commitment to working with available natural materials injects an inherent scarcity and contingency into the work.\nIn contrast to other artists who work with the land, most of Goldsworthy\u2019s works are small in scale and temporary in their installation. For these ephemeral works, Goldsworthy often uses only his bare hands, teeth, and found tools to prepare and arrange the materials. His process reveals a preoccupation with temporality and a specific attention to materials which visibly age and decay, a view which stands in contrast to monumentalism in Land Art.\nFor his permanent sculptures like \"Roof\", \"Stone River\" and \"Three Cairns\", \"Moonlit Path\" (Petworth, West Sussex, 2002) and \"Chalk Stones\" in the South Downs, near West Dean, West Sussex he has employed the use of machine tools. To create \"Roof\", Goldsworthy worked with his assistant and five British dry-stone wallers, who were used to make sure the structure could withstand time and nature.\nGoldsworthy is generally considered the founder of modern rock balancing.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nPhotography plays a crucial role in his art due to its often ephemeral and transient state. Photographs (made primarily by Goldsworthy himself) of site-specific, environmental works allow them to be shared without severing important ties to place. According to Goldsworthy, \"Each work grows, stays, decays \u2013 integral parts of a cycle which the photograph shows at its heights, marking the moment when the work is most alive. There is an intensity about a work at its peak that I hope is expressed in the image. Process and decay are implicit.\"\nPhotography aids Goldsworthy in understanding his works, as much as in communicating them to an audience. He has said, \u201cPhotography is my way of talking, writing and thinking about my art. It makes me aware of connections and developments that might have not otherwise have been apparent. It is the visual evidence which runs through my art as a whole and gives me a broader, more distant view of what I am doing.\u201d\n\n\n=== Documentary films on Goldsworthy ===\nGoldsworthy is the subject of a 2001 documentary feature film called Rivers and Tides, directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer. In 2018, Riedelsheimer released a second documentary on Goldsworthy titled Leaning Into the Wind.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1982, Goldsworthy married Judith Gregson; they had four children together before separating. He now lives in the Scottish village of Penpont with his girlfriend, Tina Fiske, an art historian.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1979 \u2013 North West Arts Award\n1980 \u2013 Yorkshire Arts Award\n1981 \u2013 Northern Arts Award\n1982 \u2013 Northern Arts Award\n1986 \u2013 Northern Arts Bursary\n1987 \u2013 Scottish Arts Council Award\n1989 \u2013 Northern Electricity Arts Award\n2000 \u2013 Appointed officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)\n\n\n== Exhibitions and installations ==\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAndy Goldsworthy (1985).

In the 1970s, he concentrated on photography, returning to paint in the 1980s, when he produced abstract works created by chance through chemical reactions between paint and other products. In the last 20 years of his life, he produced paintings focused on historical events and perceptions of them.\n\n\n== Life ==\nPolke, the seventh in a family of eight children, was born in Oels in Lower Silesia. He fled with his family to Thuringia in 1945, during the expulsion of Germans after World War II. His family escaped from the Communist regime in East Germany in 1953, traveling first to West Berlin and then to West Germany Rhineland.\nUpon his arrival in West Germany, in Willich near Krefeld, Polke began to spend time in galleries and museums and worked as an apprentice in a stained glass factory in D\u00fcsseldorf between 1959 and 1960, before entering the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf (Arts Academy) at age twenty. From 1961 to 1967 he studied at the D\u00fcsseldorf Arts Academy under Karl Otto G\u00f6tz, Gerhard Hoehme and deeply influenced by his teacher Joseph Beuys. He began his creative output during a time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere. During the 1960s, D\u00fcsseldorf, in particular, was a prosperous, commercial city and an important centre of artistic activity. In the early 1970s Polke lived at the Gaspelhof, an artists' commune.\nFrom 1977 to 1991, he was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Hamburg. His students included, among others, Georg Herold. He settled in Cologne in 1978, where he continued to live and work until his death in June 2010 after a long battle with cancer.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 1963, Polke founded the painting movement \"Kapitalistischer Realismus\"\n(\"Capitalist realism\") with Gerhard Richter  and Konrad Fischer (alias Konrad Lueg as artist). It is an anti-style of art, appropriating the pictorial shorthand of advertising. This title also referred to the realist style of art known as \"Socialist Realism\", then the official art doctrine of the Soviet Union and its satellites (from one of which Polke had fled with his family), but it also commented upon the consumer-driven art \"doctrine\" of western capitalism. He also participated in \"Demonstrative Ausstellung\", a store-front exhibition in D\u00fcsseldorf with Manfred Kuttner, Lueg, and Richter. Essentially a self-taught photographer, Polke spent the next three years painting, experimenting with filmmaking and performance art.\n\n\n=== Photography ===\nIn 1966\u201368, during his most conceptual period, Polke used a Rollei camera to capture ephemeral arrangements of objects in his home and studio. In 1968, the year after he left the art academy, Polke published these images as a portfolio of 14 photographs of small sculptures he had made from odds and ends\u2014buttons, balloons, a glove.  From 1968 to 1971, he completed several films and took thousands of photographs, most of which he could not afford to print.\nDuring the 1970s, Polke slowed his art production in favor of travel to Afghanistan, Brazil, France, Pakistan, and the U.S., where he shot photographs (using a handheld 35mm Leica camera) and film footage that he would incorporate in his subsequent works during the 1980s. In 1973 he visited the U.S. with artist James Lee Byars in search of the \"other\" America; the fruit of that journey was a series of manipulated images of homeless alcoholics living on New York's Bowery. He produced an additional series of photographic suites based on his journeys to Paris (1971), Afghanistan and Pakistan (1974) and S\u00e3o Paulo (1975), often treating the original image as raw material to be manipulated in the dark room, or in the artist's studio. Beginning with his 1971 Paris photographs printed using chemical staining to create works full of strange presences while under the influence of LSD, Polke exploited the photographic process as a means to alter \"reality.\" He combined both negatives and positives with images that had both vertical and horizontal orientations. The resulting collage-like compositions take advantage of under- and overexposure and negative and positive printing to create enigmatic narratives. With the negative in his enlarger, the artist developed large sheets selectively, pouring on photographic solutions and repeatedly creasing and folding the wet paper.\nCompleted in 1995 in collaboration with his later wife Augustina von Nagel, a suite of 35 prints entitled \"Aachener Strasse\" combine street photography with images from Polke's paintings, developed using techniques of multiple exposures and multiple negatives.\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nPolke's early work has often been characterised as European Pop art for its depiction of everyday subject matter\u2014sausages, bread and potatoes\u2014combined with images from the mass media. His \"Rasterbilder\" from that period are works that exploit the raster-dot technique of printing as a way as of subverting and bringing into question the apparent truth, validity and purpose of the media images that his paintings appropriate. He imitated the dotted effect of commercial newsprint by painstakingly painting each dot with the rubber at the end of a pencil. In works such as Carl Andre in Delft (1968), the Propellerfrau (1969) or, later, Protective Custody (1978) Polke used a canvas made of furnishing fabric, thus elevating it to the status of a visual motif. His creative output during this time of enormous social, cultural, and artistic changes in Germany and elsewhere, demonstrate most vividly his imagination, sardonic wit, and subversive approach in his drawings, watercolors, and gouaches produced during the 1960s and 1970s. Embedded in these images are incisive and parodic commentaries on consumer society, the postwar political scene in Germany, and classic artistic conventions.\n\nReturning to painting in the 1980s, he maintained his interest in alchemical properties.  In 1980, he began exploring Australia and Southeast Asia, working with materials like arsenic, meteor dust, smoke, uranium rays, lavender, cinnabar and a purple pigment from the mucus excreted by snails. He began to make large, gestural paintings which combined figurative and abstract imagery. During the 1980s he experimented with materials and chemicals, mixing together traditional pigments with solvents, varnishes, toxins and resins to produce spontaneous chemical reactions. These experiments produced elaborate abstract paintings which reflect on the concepts of originality and authorship which underpin the Modernist tradition and, in particular, the mystique of American Abstract Expressionism. A complicated \"narrative\" is often implicit in the multi-layered picture, giving the effect of witnessing the projection of a hallucination or dream through a series of veils. Polke often soaked the fabric for his paintings in resin to make it transparent. He also painted the coloured shapes on the back, so they show through as shadowy forms. By pouring colour substances on a laid out canvas and directing the process only to a restricted degree through swaying the picture's surface, Polke surrenders the task of pictorial invention to the colours themselves.\nIn 1994, he produced The Three Lies of Painting, where a landscape containing a mountain and a tree is intercut with abstract devices before succumbing to the intrusive presence of a large, vertical strip of printed fabric. It is festooned with multicoloured hands, suggesting once again that Polke wants to emphasise the artist's own manipulative. In the mid-1990s Polke began to work on a new series called Druckfehler, or 'Printing Mistakes', inspired by printing errors found in newspapers. Fascinated by the relationship between the random mistake and the original image, Polke would enlarge and manipulate the distorted newsprint. He then paints the image onto a polyester surface with the aid of a projector, and coats it in layers of resin. Buried within this elaborate surface are sheets of gold mesh, creating yet another filter through which the image must be read. In a few cases, Polke \"manufactured\" these so-called mistakes; the elongated figures in Aus 'Lernen neu zu Lernen' (From 'Learning to Learn Anew') (1998) are the result of his having dragged a picture through a photocopier.\nIn 2002, Polke developed a new technique of 'machine painting'. These are his first completely mechanically-produced paintings and are made by tinting and altering images on a computer and then photographically transferring them onto large sheets of fabric. Up until this point Polke had rejected mechanical processes, preferring to explore the visual effects of mechanical technology by hand.\nFrom 2007, Polke continued to develop and refine his \"Lens Paintings\" series. The conceptual framework of the Lens Paintings is grounded in theories set forth by monk Johann Zahn in a 1685 book on a \"teledioptric artificial eye\", a forerunner of the telephoto lens. Polke's painted \"lens\" generates a variety of distortions, mutations and spatial illusions when seen from different viewpoints.\n\n\n=== Films ===\nWhen asked to participate in Konrad Fischer's museum exhibition \"Konzeption/Conception\" (1969) at Museum Morsbroich, Polke suggested he make a film in which he scratches himself and uses a pendulum. The resulting film Der ganze K\u00f6rper f\u00fchlt sich leicht und m\u00f6chte fliegen (The Whole Body Feels Light and Wants to Fly) (1969), made in collaboration with Christof Kohlh\u00f6fer, is a 35-minute piece in which, Polke scratches himself and uses a pendulum. He also reads from the esoteric 19th-century grimoires The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses (almost inaudibly as he keeps giggling all the time) and poses as the letter X, with parallel lines of white string connecting the legs of his trousers with the arms of his shirt.\n\n\n=== Commissioned works ===\nFor the reopening of the Reichstag in Berlin in 1999, Polke created a series of large, three-dimensional lightboxes. Lighted from behind, images seen through the grooved surfaces of these lightboxes change as the viewer moves past them. Drawing on his early glass-painting training, Polke realized a series of stained-glass windows for the Grossm\u00fcnster cathedral in Z\u00fcrich between 2006 and 2009.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nPolke had his first one-person show at Galerie Ren\u00e9 Block, West Berlin, in 1966, and in 1970 he had his first solo exhibition at Galerie Michael Werner. His first solo exhibition in New York, of paintings made at least a decade earlier, was at the Holly Solomon Gallery in SoHo in 1982. Following a 1987 show at the Milwaukee Art Museum grouping Warhol, Beuys and Polke, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago mounted a solo show for Polke in 1991. Polke exhibited at three documenta and several Venice Biennial exhibitions.\nBy the latter years of his life, Polke's artistic achievements were being recognised in large-scale exhibitions around the world, with solo shows at Tate Modern in 2003\u20132004, Tokyo's Ueno Royal Museum in 2005 and the Getty Center in Los Angeles in 2007. In 2007, the \"Museum Moderner Kunst\" (MUMOK) held an exhibition of Polke's work entitled \"Sigmar Polke: Retrospektive\". Also in 2007, Axial Age (2005\u20132007), a monumental cycle of paintings, was shown for the first time at the 2007 Venice Biennale, with the wish explicitly expressed by the artist that the work should remain on display in Venice. Polke is scheduled to have a retrospective \"Alibis: Sigmar Polke 1963\u20132010\" shown at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, from 19 April to 3 August 2014, then travels to Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom and Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThrough his numerous high-profile exhibitions, Polke exerted an international influence, affecting somewhat younger artists such as his compatriots Martin Kippenberger and Albert Oehlen, Lara Schnitger (Dutch-American artist), the Americans Richard Prince, Julian Schnabel and David Salle, and the Swiss duo Fischli & Weiss. The artist John Baldessari described Polke as an \"artist's artist\". Today, Polke is often grouped with Gerhard Richter because both came of age and experimented in West Germany in the 1960s.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nPolke achieved earliest success with his paintings and drawings of consumer goods. His most recognizable works are from the mid-1960s and have performed the best at auction. A first record price for Polke's work at auction was established when Strand (Beach) (1966) sold at Christie's, in London, in 2007, for \u00a32.7 million pounds (then $5.3 million). At a Sotheby's auction in London in 2011, Polke's City Painting II (1968) sold for $7.4 million, and his Jungle (1967) established a new record for the artist at $9.2 million. Meanwhile, Untitled (S\u00e3o Paolo Series) (1975, a series of ten large photographic images which Polke made for the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial in 1975, sold at Christie's London in February 2006 for \u00a3568,000 ($988,000). His Dschungel (Jungle) (1967), a romantic landscape for which he used magnified Benday dots from a newspaper in a style similar to Roy Lichtenstein, sold from the collection of Count Christian Duerckheim to an unidentified telephone bidder for $9.2 million at Sotheby's in 2011; by 2015, it sold again for $27.1 million, the current record for one of his works.\nThe Estate of Sigmar Polke has been established by his heirs\u2014his widow, artist Augustina Baroness von Nagel, daughter Anna Polke, and son Georg Polke\u2014to build up an archive in the artist's Cologne studio. The Estate also administers the artist's intellectual property rights.

He was particularly well known for his large scale Hard-edge paintings. As an artist, multiple stylistic changes occurred throughout his career, however, none of these occurred at the same time as any popular emerging style or acted against a particular art form. In the 1950s his style reflected the abstract expressionist tone and then transitioned to a geometric style in the 1960s.  During the 1980s, there was a shift into painting that emphasized bright geometric space that's deepness reflected infinity. From 1963 to 1980 he was a professor of art at Yale University.\n\n\n== Background and education ==\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, in 1928, he grew up in the East Bronx, the son of a poor Jewish family thrown onto welfare during the depression. Held showed no interest in art until leaving the Navy in 1947. Inspired by his friend Nicholas Krushenick, Held enrolled in the Art Students League of New York. He originally thought about studying in Mexico under the prominent muralist David Siqueiros, who created gigantic pieces that contained intense political material.  However, the G.I. accreditation that he planned on using to help with his travels was not accepted at the school he planned on attending. In 1951, using the support of the G.I. Bill, he went to Paris for two years, to study at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re. In Paris, he decided that realism was not for him and moved into abstraction. During the early 1950s Avant-garde painters in the United States were receiving fresh inspiration from abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning. Together these artists brought a new way of thinking that influenced Held. He returned to New York in 1953.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThe Galerie Huit in Paris was where his first exhibition was set up in 1952. However, the art scene in New York was starting to gain new popularity and Held moved back there. During one of his solo Abstract expressionist exhibitions in 1959, Held's large-scale paintings of colourful, simple abstract geometric forms gained increasing recognition in America and Europe. In 1962, he was appointed to the faculty of Yale School of Art (where he would teach until 1980). In 1965, the critic Irving Sandler curated the critically acclaimed Concrete Expressionism show at New York University featuring the work of painters Al Held and Knox Martin and the sculptors Ronald Bladen, George Sugarman and David Weinrib.\nIn 1964, Held was awarded the Logan Medal of the Arts and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966. Feeling that he'd reached the end of his style's potential, he shifted in 1967 to black and white images that dealt with challenging perspectives and \"spatial conundrums\". Some critics dismissed this work as simply disorienting; others declared it Held's finest achievement to date. By the late 1970s, he had re-introduced color to his work. In 1988 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\nIn his later years, Held earned commissions of up to one million dollars. In 2005, he completed a large, colourful mural in the New York City Subway system, at Lexington Avenue / 51st \u2013 53rd Streets station.\nThree of Held's murals were in the original WTC 7 building.\nAt age 76, Held was found dead in his villa swimming pool near Camerata, Italy, on July 27, 2005. It is believed he died of natural causes.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Pigment paintings ===\nThe most distinguishing part of Held's pigment paintings were the thick brush strokes of paint in random directions that are reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism. These strokes were short, gestural and are commonly referred to as action painting. The colors included earth tones that are muted and spread around chaotically. Typical for many of these paintings was no foreground or background and sections were splashed with drips.  \nAs time went forward in the fifties, Held began to lengthen his gestures and combined strokes into triangles, circles, and rectangles.  This was alluding to the geometric abstractions that started at the end of 1959.\n\n\n=== Hard edge paintings ===\n\nDuring the late 1950s, gestural painting was something that Held had begun to lose interest in.  He and a few other artists such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland felt a growing problem emerge.  The style had brought a large number of mediocre artists and become overdone for them. By 1960 he had succeeded in finding an alternative method given the label hard edge.  In other ways it has been described as post-painterly abstraction, new abstraction, and cool art. The famous exhibition organizer Irving Sandler has been known to characterize it as concrete expressionism. The development of this style also led Held to change his medium from oil to a water-based acrylic.  These paintings had vivid colors geometric configurations around positioned throughout the canvas resembling a mural. All of the paintings were nonobjective meaning the artwork does not represent a person, place or thing.  Untitled from 1964, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's hard-edge style.\n\n\n=== Alphabet paintings ===\nWith these works Held takes concrete abstraction to its extreme.  Around 1961-1966 Held created large abstract letters of the English alphabet.  These paintings were given the titles The Big \u2018N', The Big \u2018X\u2019, etc.   There is a delicate alteration of the letters as Held plays with  viewers perception's by changing the figure to the frame.  The letters themselves take over the canvas and colors within the works make them seem to lean forward and backward at the same time.  It leaves the viewer to think about the ideas of space and form and how dimension plays a key role.\n\n\n=== Geometric abstraction ===\nIn 1967 Held felt that he was being limited by the flatness of previous hard edge abstractions. He wanted a way to create more picture space in some way, however painting shapes onto shapes would constantly hide beneath one another. Therefore, Held believed that adding depth and making the shapes appear three-dimensional on the canvas was his best option. The works Giza Gate II and Flemish IV are good examples of this style. A representative black-and-white mural of volumetric forms in space, Rothko's Canvas, was commissioned for The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.\n\nAll of these works are composed in acrylic black and white. The quasi-geometric structures zigzag in all directions making complex shapes usually cubical. Despite the same consistency of content throughout the works each maintain a unique design of their own. Grid like elements started becoming more apparent suggesting structure similar to that of the framework in buildings.  The paintings are in a way disorienting with their uncentered patterns and no place to gain perspective.  As his art's complexity grew the idea of his art to be deemed minimalistic became less of a dominant label.  Another remarkable characteristic of these works is the scale.  For example, in Philadelphia during 1976 he painted his two largest murals, Order/Disorder and Ascension/Descension. Each mural was 13 x 90 feet and stretches throughout an office building.\nThe P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, holds an example of Held's geometric abstraction series titled Solar Wind I, produced between 1973-74. \n\n\n=== Watercolors ===\nWhile Held was away from his studio in New York during the 1980s, he created a number of watercolor paintings in Rome. The perspective of the shapes created a sense of deep space by expanding into the canvas what seems like forever.  These works test imagination with intersecting planes and large to small forms jutting in the picture.  Held's visual concept of infinity creates a need for the viewer to look inward on themself.  Works such as Pachinko make viewers ask questions to understand how huge the structures actually are in relation to one another in the painting and this leads to more questions.  The understanding of the forms is dynamic as certain objects could be large and far away or small and near the foreground.  The perception of space challenges the audience to see the problem of observing the area around them.\n\n\n=== Contemporary works ===\nMany of Held's modern artwork includes large symmetric non-objective structures with vivid colors.  Using an acrylic medium, he created interlocking scaffolds that overlap with a deep consideration of architecture.  The ancient buildings of Rome and the idea of the renaissance inspired Held as he returned to New York.  Describing Held's images as \"room\" or \"walls\" makes sense, however, the art is non-objective and those may not be the best words to use.  On one hand the work has architectural qualities but at the same time the planes of color are nonrepresentational and in a way cannot be grasped.\nIn 1983, his 15\u2019 by 55\u2019 mural Mantegna\u2019s Edge was completed in Dallas, Texas. The work is less fragmented and a deeper sense of order compared to some of his other works.  Bright colored, grid-like structure exists harmonically in an infinite blue space.  Yet, existing within it also is a sense of paradox and complexity.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nHeld's estate has been represented by White Cube since 2018.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHeld married Giselle Wexler in 1953, with whom he had a daughter, Mara. After the break-up with his wife, he went to San Francisco where he met the soon-to-be postmodern dancer and choreographer Yvonne Rainer. They moved together to New York in 1956, got married in 1957 to split up in 1959. Then in 1969, he married the sculptor, Sylvia Stone.. He later married art historian and museum director, Kathleen Monaghan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbstract expressionism\nArt Students League of New York\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAl Held interviews, 1975 Nov. 19-1976 Jan. 8, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution\nBiography by the Sheldon Gallery\nObituary in The Guardian, 2005\nAl Held Foundation\nAl Held in the National Gallery of Australia's Kenneth Tyler collection", "Richard Prince (born 1949) is an American painter and photographer. In the mid-1970s, Prince made drawings and painterly collages that he has since disowned. His image, Untitled (Cowboy), a photographic reproduction of a photograph by Sam Abell and appropriated from a cigarette advertisement, was the first rephotograph to be sold for more than $1 million at auction at Christie's New York in 2005. He is regarded as \"one of the most revered artists of his generation\" according to The New York Times. \nStarting in 1977, Prince photographed four photographs which previously appeared in The New York Times. This process of rephotographing continued into 1983, when his work Spiritual America featured Garry Gross's photo of Brooke Shields at the age of ten, standing in a bathtub, as an allusion to precocious sexuality and to the Alfred Stieglitz photograph by the same name.  His Jokes series (beginning 1986) concerns the sexual fantasies and sexual frustrations of white, middle-class America, using stand-up comedy and burlesque humor.\nAfter living in New York City for 25 years, Prince moved to upstate New York. His mini-museum, Second House, purchased by the Guggenheim Museum, was struck by lightning and burned down shortly after the museum purchased the House (which Prince had created for himself), having only stood for six years, from 2001 to 2007. In June 2021, the painting Runaway Nurse from 2005 to 2006 fetched a record-breaking 93,986,000 HKD (US$12,121,000) at Sotheby's in Hong Kong. Prince now lives and works in New York City.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Prince was born on the 6th of August 1949, in the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone, now part of the Republic of Panama. During an interview in 2000 with Julie L. Belcove, he responded to the question of why his parents were in the Zone, by saying \"they worked for the government.\" When asked further if his father was involved in the military, Prince responded, \"No, he just worked for the government.\" The Wall Street Journal later reported that Prince's parents worked for the Office of Strategic Services in the Panama Canal before he was born. Prince later lived in the New England city of Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and Provincetown on Cape Cod. In 1973, he moved to New York and joined publishing company Time Inc. His job at the Time Inc. library involved providing the company's various magazines with tear sheets of articles.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPrince was first interested in the art of the American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. \"I was very attracted to the idea of someone who was by themselves, fairly antisocial, kind of a loner, someone who was noncollaborative.\" Prince grew up during the height of Pollock's career, making his work accessible. The 1956 Time magazine article dubbing Pollock \"Jack the Dripper\" made the thought of pursuing art as career possible. After finishing high school in 1967, Prince set off for Europe at age 18.\nHe returned home and attended Nasson College in Maine, which he described as without grades or structure. From Maine he moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, and for a brief time lived in Provincetown. Ultimately he was drawn to New York City. Prince has said that his attraction to New York was instigated by the famous photograph of Franz Kline gazing out the window of his 14th Street studio. Prince described the picture as \"a man content to be alone, pursuing the outside world from the sanctum of his studio.\"\nPrince's first solo exhibition took place in June 1980 during a residency at the CEPA gallery in Buffalo, New York. His short book Menthol Wars was published as part of the residency. In 1981 Prince had his first West Coast solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1985, he spent four months making art in a rented house in Venice, Los Angeles.\nIn late 2007, Prince had a retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, a comprehensive show hung in chronological order along the upward spiraling walls. The show continued onto the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Maria Morris Hamburg, the curator of photography at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, asserted, \"He is absolutely essential to what's going on today, he figured out before anyone else\u2014and in a very precocious manner\u2014how thoroughly pervasive the media is. It's not just an aspect of our lives, but the dominant aspect of our lives.\"\nPrince has built up a large collection of Beat books and papers. Prince owns several copies of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, including one inscribed to Kerouac's mother, one famously read on The Steve Allen Show, the original proof copy of the book and an original galley, as well as the copy owned by Neal Cassady (the Dean Moriarty character in the book), with Cassady's signature and marginal notes.\nDescribing his career and methodology in a 2005 New York magazine interview, Prince said, \"It's about knocking about in the studio and bumping into things.\"\n\n\n=== Rephotography ===\nRe-photography uses appropriation as its own focus: artists pull from the works of others and the worlds they depict to create their own work. Appropriation art became popular in the late 1970s. Other appropriation artists such as, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Vikky Alexander, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger and Mike Bidlo also became prominent in the East Village in the 1980s. This grouping of artists became known as the \"Pictures Generation.\" All of these artists were greatly influenced by the work of John Baldessari and Robert Heinecken, both of whom have worked extensively with found or readymade print photography since the 1960s, Baldessari working mainly with Hollywood film stills and Heineken mainly with magazine advertisements and print pornography. Both artists taught at UCLA and the California Institute for the Arts in Southern California throughout the 1970s, when many of these artists attended school there.\nDuring the early period of his career, Prince worked in Time magazine's tear sheets department. At the end of each work day, he would be left with nothing but the torn out advertising images from the eight or so magazines owned by Time-Life. On the topic of found photographs, Prince said, \"Oceans without surfers, cowboys without Marlboros\u2026Even though I\u2019m aware of the classicism of the images. I seem to go after images that I don\u2019t quite believe. And, I try to re-present them even more unbelievably.\"\n\nPrince had very little experience with photography, but he has said in interviews that all he needed was a subject, the medium would follow, whether it be paint and brush or camera and film. He compared his new method of searching out interesting advertisements to \"beachcombing.\" His first series during this time focused on models, living room furniture, watches, pens, and jewellery.  Pop culture became the focus of his work. Prince described his experience of appropriation thus: \"At first it was pretty reckless. Plagiarizing someone else\u2019s photograph, making a new picture effortlessly. Making the exposure, looking through the lens and clicking, felt like an unwelling . . . a whole new history without the old one. It absolutely destroyed any associations I had experienced with putting things together. And of course the whole thing about the naturalness of the film\u2019s ability to appropriate. I always thought it had a lot to do with having a chip on your shoulder.\"\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Patrick Cariou copyright infringement suit ===\n\nIn December 2008, photographer Patrick Cariou filed suit against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Lawrence Gagosian and Rizzoli International Publications in Federal district court for copyright infringement in work shown at Prince's Canal Zone exhibit at the Gagosian gallery. Prince was charged with wrongfully appropriating 35 photographs made by Cariou. Several of the pieces were barely changed by Prince.  Prince also made 28 paintings that included images from Cariou's Yes Rasta book. The book featured a series of photographs of Rastafarians that Cariou had taken in Jamaica.\nOn March 18, 2011, US District Judge Deborah A. Batts ruled against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Inc., and Lawrence Gagosian.  The court found that the use by Prince was not fair use (his primary defence), and Cariou's issue of liability for copyright infringement was granted in its entirety.  The court cited much case law including the Rogers v. Koons case of 1992. On April 25, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Batts's ruling, stating that Prince's use of the photographs in 25 works was transformative and thus fair use. Five less transformative works were sent back to the lower court for review. The case was settled in 2014.\n\n\n=== Appropriation of Emily Ratajkowski's Image ===\nIn 2014, Prince appropriated one of Emily Ratajkowski's Instagram posts without her consent and included the image in his \"New Portraits\" exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in New York. Seven years later, Ratajkowski took a photograph of herself standing in front of the painting, and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it. The NFT sold at auction at Christie's for $175,000. \"I hope to symbolically set a precedent for women and ownership online, one that allows for women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution,\" Ratajkowski wrote on Twitter. Ratajkowski describes the event in the popular essay for The Cut, titled \"Buying Myself Back\". The controversy raises questions about personality rights and who gets to benefit from the use of one's image.\n\n\n=== Eric McNatt and Donald Graham infringement suits ===\nIn 2016, photographer Donald Graham sued Prince for violating the copyright on his 1998 photograph, Rastafarian Smoking a Joint by including the photograph in his \"New Portraits\" series. In May of 2023, a New York judge ruled that Prince's artwork Untitled (Portrait of Rastajay92) was not \"transformative\" enough to shield Prince from litigation, and that Graham's copyright infringement case can proceed to trial. Photographer Eric McNatt similarly sued Prince in 2016 for infringing on his copyright to his portrait of Kim Gordon, co-founder of the band Sonic Youth. On January 26 2024, the two linked cases were settled, with damages awarded to Graham and McNatt, but without any admission of infringement by Prince. [1]\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Cowboys ===\nPrince's series known as the Untitled Cowboys, produced from 1980 to 1992, and ongoing, is his most famous group of rephotographs. Taken from Marlboro cigarette advertisements of the Marlboro Man, they represent an idealized figure of American masculinity. The Marlboro Man was the iconic equivalent of later brands like Ralph Lauren, which used the polo pony image to identify and associate its brand. \"Every week. I'd see one and be like, Oh that's mine, Thank you,\" Prince stated in an interview.\nPrince's Cowboys displayed men in boots and ten-gallon hats, with horses, lassos, spurs and all the fixings that make up the stereotypical image of a cowboy. They were set in the Western U.S., in arid landscapes with stone outcrops flanked by cacti and tumbleweeds, with backdrops of sunsets. The advertisements were staged with the utmost attention to detail.\nPrince's rephotographs of the Marlboro Man advertisements attempt to question how original and realistic the commercial depiction of a \"macho man on the horse\" is. Prince described his process in a 2003 interview by Steve Lafreiniere in Artforum: \"I had limited technical skills regarding the camera. Actually I had no skills. I played the camera. I used a cheap commercial lab to blow up the pictures. I made editions of two. I never went into a darkroom.\"\nWhile Prince re-contextualizes images by others to redefine them, he has also failed to acknowledge those preceding photographers whose work he appropriates. For the Untitled (Cowboy) Series, this includes Norm Clasen and a handful of others. Clasen has expressed being aggrieved over the failure to attribute his work saying: \"If you see somebody's copied your work, there's something deep down in you that says \"I'm the author of that.\"'\nUntitled (Cowboy) has since been credited by Time Magazine as one of the \"Top 100 most influential images of all time.\"\n\n\n=== Jokes, Gangs, and Hoods ===\nPrince's rephotographs led to his series known as the Gangs, which followed the same technique of appropriating images from magazines as the Cowboys did, but now the subjects moved from advertisements and mass media toward niches in American society.\nPrince in this series paid homage to \"sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll\" in American niches, seen through magazines. He depicted the bizarre in subcultures such as the motorcycle-obsessed, hot rod enthusiasts, surfers, and heavy metal music fans. These Gangs are recognized in his series Girlfriends, featuring biker girls. A motorcycle magazine he used featured photographs of motorcyclists' girlfriends, were sprawled on their boyfriends' bikes. Prince's Gangs works are single sheets of white paper covered with a grouping or \"ganging\" of 9\u00d712, 35 mm photographs. Prince did not intend any distinct relationship between the \"ganged\" photographs. An example can be seen in such works as his 1984 Velvet Beach, twelve Ektacolor-printed photographs of massive waves, clearly from a surf magazine. Another example is his 1986 Live Free or Die, gathering nine images of loosely dressed women on motorcycles.\nPrince's made his first Joke painting circa 1985, in New York, when he was living in the back room of 303 Gallery located on Park Avenue South. The first joke represented was about psychiatrists, a subject he later worked with often. Prince described the discovery of the idea for the Joke Paintings beginning when he posted a small 11 \u00d7 14 inch handwritten joke on paper. He realized that if he had walked into a gallery and had seen it hanging from the wall, he would have been envious. Prince's Jokes come in several forms. His first Jokes were hand written, taken from joke books. His jokes grew into more substantial works as he began to incorporate them with images, often pairing jokes with images that had no relevance with one another, creating an obscure relationship. An example of one of these peculiar combinations can be seen in his 1991 Good Revolution, which depicted black and white images of a male torso in boxing shorts set amongst doodles of a kitchen stove. These were set above the text \"Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman that will give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong home, that's what it means.\" Another one of Prince's most well-known Joke paintings is an 80s-style red canvas painting he did in 2004 that says, \"Two psychiatrists, one says to the other: I was having lunch with my mother the other day and I made a Freudian slip. I meant to say, 'Please pass the butter,' and instead it came out, 'You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.'\"\nIn the late 1980s, Prince, like his contemporaries Lorna Simpson and Barbara Kruger, as well as many of his Conceptual Art precursors, played with image and text in a strategy that was becoming increasingly popular. Prince put jokes among cartoons, often from The New Yorker. Prince described his early discovery of jokes and his sense of humor, as \"I never really started telling, I started telling them over. Back in 1985, in Venice, California, I was drawing my favorite cartoons in pencil on paper. After this I dropped the illustration or image part of the cartoon and concentrated on the punch line.\" Prince's jokes were primarily satirical one-liners, poking fun at topics such as religion, the relationship between husband and wife, his relations with women. The jokes are simple, often relying on a punch line: \"I took my wife to a wife-swapping party, I had to throw in some cash\" or \"I never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name.\"\nJokes became the complete subject of his prints, set atop monochromatic backgrounds red, orange, blue, yellow, etc. These works range in size from 56 \u00d7 48 inches as seen in his 1994 Untitled, to 112 \u00d7 203.5 inches, as seen in his 2000 work Nuts. His early jokes were modestly sized, but as they caught on he executed larger pieces. These Monochromatic Jokes question the importance of the unique, in high art. What is it that set these jokes apart from one another, the background color, the color of the text, the jokes themselves? Compared to other Appropriation Artists working in the same time period, Prince has a distinct quality between works and series. Works are distinguishable from one another or identifiable as a particular artist, but with Prince's Monochromatic Jokes, we are presented with yellow text upon a blue background as in his 1989 Are You Kidding? Differing from Jeff Koons, for example, are not only technique and style, but also the significance given to making the artwork identifiable. In 1988 Koons was working with porcelain sculptures like his Michael Jackson and Bubbles and Pink Panther. These are two works produced in this year that are distinguishable. In the same year, 1988, are Prince's Fireman and the Drunk and his Untitled (Joke), which raise the serious question of what sets these two works apart. In a 2000 interview with Julie L. Belcove, Prince called the joke paintings \"what I wanted to become known for.\" When asked to identify the artistic genre of his Jokes, Prince responded, \"the Joke paintings are abstract. Especially in Europe, if you can't speak English.\"\nWhile developing his Gang photographs and Joke paintings Prince was also making sculptural facsimiles of muscle car hoods that merged muscle car culture as a particularly American state of mind. Prince ordered classic vehicle car hoods from within custom car restoration networks and then used the hoods to cast Fiberglas molds which he washed in different colors.\n\n\n=== Celebrities ===\nCelebrities is a series that plays with the American obsession with movie stars. Following Warhol's lead, Prince would search out actors' headshots, promotional photographs which frequently lack copyright protection. Prince signed them himself, using the actor's name.\n\n\n=== Check Paintings ===\nThe Check Paintings series is like the Celebrities. It was made possible by Prince's own interest in collecting. Prince began to seek out canceled checks from famous figures in history ranging from Jack Kerouac to Andy Warhol. He put these checks onto paint-covered canvases and often paired them with images of the individual they once belonged to.\n\n\n=== Nurse Paintings ===\nThe Nurse Paintings are a series inspired by the covers and titles of inexpensive novels that were commonly sold at newspaper stands and delis (pulp romance novels). Prince scanned the covers of the books on his computer and used inkjet printing to transfer the images to canvas, and then personalized the pieces with acrylic paint. They debuted in 2003 at Barbara Gladstone Galleries, who along with Larry Gagosian, represents Prince. They received mixed responses, not all selling at the asking prices of $50,000 to $60,000. Titles include Surfer Nurse, Naughty Nurse, Millionaire Nurse, and Dude Ranch Nurse, the books from which they were copied. Prince said, \"The problem with art is, it's not like the game of golf, where you put the ball in the hole or you don't put the ball in the hole. There's no umpire. There's no judge. There are no rules. It's one of the problems, but it's also one of the great things about art: it becomes a question of what lasts.\" The Sonic Youth album Sonic Nurse used Nurse paintings, and included a song called \"Dude Ranch Nurse\". \nIn the series of paintings, the nurses all wear caps and their mouths are covered by surgical masks, although in some of the paintings the red lips bleed through the masks. The final presentations preserve the title and nurse image from each of the book covers, though almost all else is obscured. Titles include A Nurse Involved, Aloha Nurse, Bachelor Nurse, Danger Nurse at Work, Debutant Nurse, and Doctor's Nurse.\nPrince's Nurse paintings have become by far his most expensive series, accounting for his 17 biggest results at auction as of September 2021.\n\n\n=== Later works ===\nPrince's series of paintings from 2007 on appear to be a throwback to more traditional genres of figurative art, and a departure from the pulpy and kitschy content of the Nurse and Jokes series. They are pornographic ink-jet prints overlaid with acrylic paint in a style trying to imitate Willem de Kooning. Prince makes the most direct treatment to the faces, hands and feet, which are bulged and distorted. These works lack the obvious linguistic re-contextualizing of the Jokes series, opting instead for a purely visual idiom.\nIn 2007, Prince collaborated with the fashion designer Marc Jacobs on his Spring 2008 collection for the French label Louis Vuitton.\nAn untitled work consists of the body of a 1970 Dodge Challenger and high-performance parts such as a 660 hp Hemi engine, custom interior, black wheel wells, 14-inch tires in the front and 16 inch in the back, a pale orange paint job with a flat black T/A hood, as well as various decals and emblems. Another car sculpture, called American Prayer, is a 1968 Dodge Charger that has been completely emptied of any engine parts and interiors and is stripped of any paint and then powder coated. In place of the engine block there is a cement block.\nIn Untitled (Covering Pollock), a series of 27 works made between 2009 and 2011, Prince printed black-and-white photos of Jackson Pollock taken by Hans Namuth on canvas and pasted grids of photographs showing Sid Vicious, Kate Moss, Stephanie Seymour and pornographic imagery on top. Prince adds his own Pollock-style gestures in paint around the grids.\nIn 2014, Prince continued his appropriation theme with an exhibit of 38 portraits at the Gagosian gallery in New York City, entitled \"New Portraits.\" Each image was taken from his Instagram feed and included topless images of models, artists, and celebrities. Underneath the images, Prince provided comments like, \"Don't du anything. Just B Urself \u00a9 \u00ae\", with the copyright and registered trademark symbols likely being references to his interests in authorship. \"Possible cogent responses to the show include naughty delight and sheer abhorrence\", wrote art critic Peter Schjeldahl in The New Yorker. \"My own was something like a wish to be dead.\" As with previous appropriated Prince works, the Instagram prints draw attention to the intersection of art and copyright infringement. Some of the unwilling subjects of his art, notably members of SuicideGirls, have started selling their own derivative works based on Prince derivative works of their original works.\nIn 2015, Prince would repeat his exhibit from Gagosian with a new exhibit for the Frieze Art Fair in NYC. However, Prince would end up making headlines due to selling the portraits for profit\u2014at the fair, Prince sold enlargements of his Instagram feed and comments for $90,000.\nIn 2017, he generated controversy by returning a $36,000 payment he had received in 2014 for his portrayal of Ivanka Trump, claiming that he could not live with the idea of one of his works being in the collection of the Trump family.\n\n\n== Museum exhibitions ==\nPrince has been the subject of major survey exhibitions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1992); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1993); Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993); Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst, Basel (2001, traveled to Kunsthalle Z\u00fcrich and Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg); Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2007, traveled to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 2008); and Serpentine Gallery, London (2008). \"Richard Prince: American Prayer,\" an exhibition of American literature and ephemera from the artist's collection, was on view at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Paris in 2011. Prince's work has also appeared numerous group exhibitions, including in Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo (1983), Whitney Biennial (1985, 1987, 1997, and 2004), Biennale of Sydney (1986), Venice Biennale (1988 and 2007), and documenta 9 (1992).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPrince lives in New York with his wife, the artist Noel Grunwaldt.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nO'Brien, Glenn et al.

These words also serve as the basis for his work on canvas.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBorn in Normandy to a French father and a British mother, Seb Toussaint made his first creations as a teenager with the Malherbe Normandy Kop (creation of tifos, banners and fan merchandise), a group of supporters of football supporters from his hometown. At the same time, he started to paint graffiti in the streets of his region.\nIn 2011 and 2012, he cycled around the world with two childhood friends and took the opportunity to perfect his art on the walls of the countries he visited. This trip gave him the idea to create Share the Word Project.\nIn 2023, he joined the collections of the Museum of Impressionism in Giverny.\n\n\n== Share the Word Project ==\nIn 2013, he created Outsiders Krew, an art collective with Norman photographer Spag Bertin and started Share the Word Project.\nDuring each episode of this project, Seb Toussaint spends a month in a marginalized community (slums, favelas, refugee camps, etc.) and asks the inhabitants to choose words which he then paints on their houses. The murals produced then serve as a support to tell the stories of these anonymous people and their neighborhoods.\n\n\n=== Project host countries ===\n(From 2013 to today; the city and district of residence are listed in parentheses)\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== PAZ in Colombia ==\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Seb Toussaint returned to Bogot\u00e1 in the district of Mariscal Sucre (the location of the 4th episode of Share the Word Project two years earlier) to paint a mega mural on sixteen dwellings. The inhabitants choose together the word PAZ (\u201cPeace\u201d in Spanish) to express their wish for the future of the district.\nAt the same time, the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC were in major negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement between the two parties. This  combination of circumstances then gave a spotlight on Seb Toussaint's mural who will shortly after receive joint public congratulations from the Colombian president and the FARC.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n\n=== 2020 ===\nEsposizione Share The Word, Favara, Sicily (Italy)\n\n\n=== 2019 ===\nPartage de mots, Abidjan, Ivory Coast\n\n\n=== 2018 ===\nChromatic Voices, Nablus, Palestine\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nQuand Seb Toussaint fait parler les murs, Niamey, Niger\nPeace, Le Mur, Cherbourg, France\nBogot\u00e0, Visaje Grafitti, Bogot\u00e0, Colombia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSeb Toussaint Website\nSeb Toussaint Instagram", "Marina Abramovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, pronounced [mar\u01d0\u02d0na abr\u01ce\u02d0mo\u028bit\u0255]; born November 30, 1946) is a Serbian conceptual and performance artist. Her work explores body art, endurance art, the relationship between the performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Being active for over four decades, Abramovi\u0107 refers to herself as the \"grandmother of performance art\". She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on \"confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body\". In 2007, she founded the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute (MAI), a non-profit foundation for performance art.\n\n\n== Early life, education and teaching ==\nAbramovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, on November 30, 1946. In an interview, Abramovi\u0107 described her family as having been \"Red bourgeoisie\". Her great-uncle was Varnava, Serbian Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Both of her Montenegrin-born parents, Danica Rosi\u0107 and Vojin Abramovi\u0107, were Yugoslav Partisans during World War II. After the war, Abramovi\u0107's parents were awarded Order of the People's Heroes and were given positions in the postwar Yugoslavian government.\nAbramovi\u0107 was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old. Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramovi\u0107 \"spent [her] childhood in a church following [her] grandmother's rituals\u2014candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions\". When she was six, her brother was born, and she began living with her parents while also taking piano, French, and English lessons. Although she did not take art lessons, she took an early interest in art and enjoyed painting as a child.\nLife in Abramovi\u0107's parental home under her mother's strict supervision was difficult. When Abramovi\u0107 was a child, her mother beat her for \"supposedly showing off\". In an interview published in 1998, Abramovi\u0107 described how her \"mother took complete military-style control of me and my brother. I was not allowed to leave the house after 10 o'clock at night until I was 29 years old. ... [A]ll the performances in Yugoslavia I did before 10 o'clock in the evening because I had to be home then. It's completely insane, but all of my cutting myself, whipping myself, burning myself, almost losing my life in 'The Firestar'\u2014everything was done before 10 in the evening.\"\nIn an interview published in 2013, Abramovi\u0107 said, \"My mother and father had a terrible marriage.\" Describing an incident when her father smashed 12 champagne glasses and left the house, she said, \"It was the most horrible moment of my childhood.\"\n\n\n== Education and teaching career ==\nShe was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade from 1965 to 1970. She completed her post-graduate studies in the art class of Krsto Hegedu\u0161i\u0107 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, SR Croatia, in 1972. Then she returned to SR Serbia and, from 1973 to 1975, taught at the Academy of Fine Arts at Novi Sad while launching her first solo performances.\nIn 1976, following her marriage to Ne\u0161a Paripovi\u0107 (between 1970 and 1976), Abramovi\u0107 went to Amsterdam to perform a piece and then decided to move there permanently.\nFrom 1990 to 1995, Abramovi\u0107 was a visiting professor at the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and at the Berlin University of the Arts. From 1992 to 1996 she also served as a visiting professor at the Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg and from 1997 to 2004 she was a professor for performance-art at the Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Braunschweig.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Rhythm 10, 1973 ===\nIn her first performance in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramovi\u0107 explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"\n\n\n=== Rhythm 5, 1974 ===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star or pentagram represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large pentagram. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"\n\n\n=== Rhythm 2, 1974 ===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from catatonia, to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.\n\n\n=== Rhythm 4, 1974 ===\nRhythm 4 was performed at the Galleria Diagramma in Milan. In this piece, Abramovi\u0107 knelt alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan. She approached the fan slowly, attempting to breathe in as much air as possible to push the limits of her lungs. Soon after she lost consciousness.\nAbramovi\u0107's previous experience in Rhythm 5, when the audience interfered in the performance, led to her devising specific plans so that her loss of consciousness would not interrupt the performance before it was complete. Before the beginning of her performance, Abramovi\u0107 asked the cameraman to focus only on her face, disregarding the fan. This was so the audience would be oblivious to her unconscious state, and therefore unlikely to interfere. Ironically, after several minutes of Abramovi\u0107's unconsciousness, the cameraman refused to continue and sent for help.\n\n\n=== Rhythm 0, 1974 ===\n\nTo test the limits of the relationship between performer and audience, Abramovi\u0107 developed one of her most challenging and best-known performances. She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force that would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences. At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\" As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you. ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\" \nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.\n\n\n=== Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen) ===\n\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the West German performance artist Uwe Laysiepen, who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration, the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\". This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\". They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, since it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self made available for self-scrutiny\".\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation, and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"\n\nIn Relation in Space (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".\nRelation in Movement (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\nIn Relation in Time (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.\nTo create Breathing In/Breathing Out the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Nineteen minutes after the beginning of the performance they pulled away from each other, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\nIn Imponderabilia (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.\nIn AAA-AAA (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths. This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.\nIn 1980, they performed Rest Energy, in an art exhibition in Dublin, where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upper hand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were Ulay aiming a bow at Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed Nightsea Crossing in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey that would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500 km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.\" She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending ... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\" She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \"dragon of energy\". It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by which time their relationship had completely dissolved.\nAt her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramovi\u0107 performed The Artist Is Present, in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her. Although \"they met and talked the morning of the opening\", Abramovi\u0107 had a deeply emotional reaction to Ulay when he arrived at her performance, reaching out to him across the table between them; the video of the event went viral.\nIn November 2015, Ulay took Abramovi\u0107 to court, claiming she had paid him insufficient royalties according to the terms of a 1999 contract covering sales of their joint works and a year later, in September 2016, Abramovi\u0107 was ordered to pay Ulay \u20ac250,000. In its ruling, the court in Amsterdam found that Ulay was entitled to royalties of 20% net on the sales of their works, as specified in the original 1999 contract, and ordered Abramovi\u0107 to backdate royalties of more than \u20ac250,000, as well as more than \u20ac23,000 in legal costs. Additionally, she was ordered to provide full accreditation to joint works listed as by \"Ulay/Abramovi\u0107\" covering the period from 1976 to 1980, and \"Abramovi\u0107/Ulay\" for those from 1981 to 1988.\n\n\n=== Cleaning the Mirror, 1995 ===\n\nCleaning the Mirror consisted of five monitors playing footage in which Abramovi\u0107 scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the different parts of the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. Cleaning the Mirror #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum for five hours.\n\n\n=== Spirit Cooking, 1996 ===\nAbramovi\u0107 worked with Jacob Samuel to produce a cookbook of \"aphrodisiac recipes\" called Spirit Cooking in 1996. These \"recipes\" were meant to be \"evocative instructions for actions or for thoughts\". For example, one of the recipes calls for \"13,000 grams of jealousy\", while another says to \"mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk.\" The work was inspired by the popular belief that ghosts feed off intangible things like light, sound, and emotions.\nIn 1997, Abramovi\u0107 created a multimedia Spirit Cooking installation. This was originally installed in the Zerynthia Associazione per l'Arte Contemporanea in Rome, Italy, and included white gallery walls with \"enigmatically violent recipe instructions\" painted in pig's blood. According to Alexxa Gotthardt, the work is \"a comment on humanity's reliance on ritual to organize and legitimize our lives and contain our bodies\".\nAbramovic also published a Spirit Cooking cookbook, containing comico-mystical, self-help instructions that are meant to be just poetry. Spirit Cooking later evolved into a form of dinner party entertainment that Abramovic occasionally lays on for collectors, donors, and friends.\n\n\n=== Balkan Baroque, 1997 ===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 vigorously scrubbed thousands of bloody cow bones over a period of four days, in reference to the ethnic cleansing that had taken place in the Balkans during the 1990s. This performance piece earned Abramovi\u0107 the Golden Lion award at the Venice Biennale.\nAbramovi\u0107 created Balkan Baroque as a response to the war in Bosnia. She remembers other artists reacting immediately, creating work and protesting about the effects and horrors of the war. Abramovi\u0107 could not bring herself to create work on the matter so soon, as it was too close to home for her. Eventually, Abramovi\u0107 returned to Belgrade, where she interviewed her mother, her father, and a rat-catcher. She then incorporated these interviews into her piece, as well as clips of the hands of her father, her father holding a pistol and her mother showing empty hands then crossed hands. Abramovi\u0107 is dressed as a doctor recounting the story of the rat-catcher. While this is happening, Abramovi\u0107 sits among a large pile of bones and tries to wash them.\nThe performance occurred in Venice in 1997. Abramovi\u0107 remembered the horrible smell \u2013 for it was extremely hot in Venice during the summer \u2013 and that worms emerged from the bones. She has explained that the idea of scrubbing the bones clean, trying to remove the blood, is impossible. The point Abramovi\u0107 is trying to make is that blood can't be washed from bones and hands, just as the war can't be cleansed of shame. She wanted to allow the images from the performance to speak for not only the war in Bosnia, but for any war, anywhere in the world.\n\n\n=== Seven Easy Pieces, 2005 ===\n\nBeginning on November 9, 2005, Abramovi\u0107 presented Seven Easy Pieces at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to re-performing her own Thomas Lips and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist. Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of Gina Pane's The Conditioning, which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of Vito Acconci's 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramovi\u0107 re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals. All seven performances were dedicated to Abramovi\u0107's late friend Susan Sontag.\nA full list of the works performed is as follows:\n\nBruce Nauman's Body Pressure (1974)\nVito Acconci's Seedbed (1972)\nValie Export's Action Pants: Genital Panic (1969)\nGina Pane's The Conditioning (1973)\nJoseph Beuys's How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (1965)\nAbramovi\u0107's own Thomas Lips (1975)\nAbramovi\u0107's own Entering the Other Side (2005)\n\n\n=== The Artist Is Present: March\u2013May 2010 ===\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramovi\u0107's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history, curated by Klaus Biesenbach. Biesenbach also provided the title for the performance, which referred to the fact that during the entire performance \"the artist would be right there in the gallery or the museum.\"\nDuring the run of the exhibition, Abramovi\u0107 performed The Artist Is Present, a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. Ulay made a surprise appearance at the opening night of the show.\nAbramovi\u0107 sat in a rectangle drawn with tape in the floor of the second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovi\u0107. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less, a few sat with her for an entire day. The line attracted no attention from museum security until the last day of the exhibition, when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed, Alan Rickman, Jemima Kirke, Jennifer Carpenter, and Bj\u00f6rk; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovi\u0107 concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.\nA support group for the \"sitters\", \"Sitting with Marina\", was established on Facebook, as was the blog \"Marina Abramovi\u0107 made me cry\". The Italian photographer Marco Anelli took portraits of every person who sat opposite Abramovi\u0107, which were published on Flickr, compiled in a book and featured in an exhibition at the Danziger Gallery in New York.\nAbramovi\u0107 said the show changed her life \"completely \u2013 every possible element, every physical emotion\". After Lady Gaga saw the show and publicized it, Abramovi\u0107 found a new audience: \"So the kids from 12 and 14 years old to about 18, the public who normally don't go to the museum, who don't give a shit about performance art or don't even know what it is, started coming because of Lady Gaga. And they saw the show and then they started coming back. And that's how I get a whole new audience.\" In September 2011, a video game version of Abramovi\u0107's performance was released by Pippin Barr. In 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked The Artist Is Present ninth (along with Rhythm 0) in his list of the greatest performance art works.\nHer performance inspired Australian novelist Heather Rose to write The Museum of Modern Love and she subsequently launched the US edition of the book at the Museum of Modern Art in 2018.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn 2009, Abramovi\u0107 was featured in Chiara Clemente's documentary Our City Dreams and a book of the same name. The five featured artists \u2013 also including Swoon, Ghada Amer, Kiki Smith, and Nancy Spero \u2013 \"each possess a passion for making work that is inseparable from their devotion to New York\", according to the publisher. Abramovi\u0107 is also the subject of an independent documentary film entitled Marina Abramovi\u0107: The Artist Is Present, which is based on her life and performance at her retrospective \"The Artist Is Present\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. The film was broadcast in the United States on HBO and won a Peabody Award in 2012. In January 2011, Abramovi\u0107 was on the cover of Serbian ELLE, photographed by Du\u0161an Reljin. Kim Stanley Robinson's science fiction novel 2312 mentions a style of performance art pieces known as \"abramovics\".\nA world premiere installation by Abramovi\u0107 was featured at Toronto's Trinity Bellwoods Park as part of the Luminato Festival in June 2013. Abramovi\u0107 is also co-creator, along with Robert Wilson of the theatrical production The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi\u0107, which had its North American premiere at the festival, and at the Park Avenue Armory in December.\nIn 2007 Abramovi\u0107 created the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute (MAI), a nonprofit foundation for performance art, in a 33,000 square-foot space in Hudson, New York. She also founded a performance institute in San Francisco. She is a patron of the London-based Live Art Development Agency.\nIn June 2014 she presented a new piece at London's Serpentine Gallery called 512 Hours. In the Sean Kelly Gallery-hosted Generator, (December 6, 2014) participants are blindfolded and wear noise-canceling headphones in an exploration of nothingness.\nIn celebration of her 70th birthday on November 30, 2016, Abramovi\u0107 took over the Guggenheim museum (eleven years after her previous happening there) for her birthday party entitled \"Marina 70\". Part one of the evening, titled \"Silence,\" lasted 70 minutes, ending with the crash of a gong struck by the artist. Then came the more conventional part two: \"Entertainment\", during which Abramovi\u0107 took to the stage to make a speech before watching English singer and visual artist ANOHNI perform the song \"My Way\" while wearing a large black hood.\nIn March 2015, Abramovi\u0107 presented a TED talk titled, \"An art made of trust, vulnerability and connection\".\nIn 2019, IFC's mockumentary show Documentary Now! parodied Abramovi\u0107's work and the documentary film Marina Abramovi\u0107: The Artist Is Present. The episode, titled \"Waiting for the Artist\", starred Cate Blanchett as Isabella Barta (Abramovi\u0107) and Fred Armisen as Dimo (Ulay).\nOriginally set to open September 26, 2020, her first major exhibition in the UK at the Royal Academy of Arts has been rescheduled for autumn 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Academy, the exhibition will \"bring together works spanning her 50-year career, along with new works conceived especially for these galleries. As Abramovi\u0107 approaches her mid-70s, her new work reflects on changes to the artist's body, and explores her perception of the transition between life and death.\"\nIn 2021, she inaugurated a monument, Crystal wall of crying, at the site of a Holocaust massacre in Ukraine of Babi Yar memorials.\nIn 2022, she condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn 2023, she was the first woman in 255 years to be invited to give a solo show in the main galleries of the Royal Academy.\n\n\n=== Refused proposals ===\nAbramovi\u0107 had proposed some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One such proposal was titled \"Come to Wash with Me\". This performance would take place in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramovi\u0107. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.\nIn 1970 she proposed a similar idea to the same gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramovi\u0107 would stand in front of the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. \"From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger.\" The performance had two possible outcomes.\nThe list of Mother's clothes included:\n\nHeavy brown pin for the hair\nWhite cotton blouse with red dots\nLight pink bra \u2013 2 sizes too big\nDark pink heavy flannel slip \u2013 three sizes too big\nDark blue skirt \u2013 mid-calf\nSkin color heavy synthetic stockings\nHeavy orthopedic shoes with laces\n\n\n== Films ==\nAbramovi\u0107 directed a segment, Balkan Erotic Epic, in Destricted, a compilation of erotic films made in 2006. In 2008 she directed a segment Dangerous Games in another film compilation Stories on Human Rights. She also acted in a five-minute short film Antony and the Johnsons: Cut the World.\n\n\n== Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute ==\nThe Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute (MAI) is a performance art organization with a focus on performance, long durational works, and the use of the \"Abramovic Method\".\nIn its early phases, it was a proposed multi-functional museum space in Hudson, New York. Abramovi\u0107 purchased the site for the institute in 2007. Located in Hudson, New York, the building was built in 1933 and has been used as a theater and community tennis center. The building was to be renovated according to a design by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of OMA. The early design phase of this project was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign was funded by more than 4,000 contributors, including Lady Gaga and Jay-Z. The building project was canceled in October 2017 due to its high anticipated cost,\nThe institute continues to operate as a traveling organization. To date, MAI has partnered with many institutions and artists internationally, traveling to Brazil, Greece, and Turkey.\n\n\n== Collaborations ==\nIn her youth, she was a performer in one of Hermann Nitsch's performances which were part of the Viennese actionism.\nAbramovi\u0107 maintains a friendship with actor James Franco, who interviewed her for The Wall Street Journal in 2009. Franco visited her during The Artist Is Present in 2010, and the two also attended the 2012 Met Gala together.\nIn July 2013, Abramovi\u0107 worked with Lady Gaga on the pop singer's third album Artpop. Gaga's work with Abramovi\u0107, as well as artists Jeff Koons and Robert Wilson, was displayed at an event titled \"ArtRave\" on November 10. Furthermore, both have collaborated on projects supporting the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute, including Gaga's participation in an 'Abramovi\u0107 Method' video and a nonstop reading of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's sci-fi novel Solaris.\nAlso that month, Jay-Z showcased an Abramovi\u0107-inspired piece at Pace Gallery in New York City. He performed his art-inspired track \"Picasso Baby\" for six straight hours. During the performance, Abramovi\u0107 and several figures in the art world were invited to dance with him standing face to face. The footage was later turned into a music video. She allowed Jay-Z to adapt \"The Artist Is Present\" under the condition that he would donate to her institute. Abramovi\u0107 stated that Jay-Z did not live up to his end of the deal, describing the performance as a \"one-way transaction\". However, two years later in 2015, Abramovi\u0107 publicly issued an apology stating she was never informed of Jay-Z's sizable donation.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAbramovi\u0107 sparked controversy in August 2016 when passages from an early draft of her memoir were released, in which\u2014based on notes from her 1979 initial encounter with Aboriginal Australians\u2014she compared them to dinosaurs and observed that \"they have big torsos (just one bad result of their encounter with Western civilization is a high sugar diet that bloats their bodies) and sticklike legs\". She responded to the controversy on Facebook, writing, \"I have the greatest respect for the Aborigine people, to whom I owe everything.\"\nAmong the Podesta emails was a message from Abramovi\u0107 to Podesta's brother discussing an invitation to a spirit cooking, which was interpreted by conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones as an invitation to a satanic ritual, and presented by Jones and others as proof that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had links with the occult. In a 2013 Reddit Q&A, in response to a question about occult in contemporary art, she said: \"Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not\". \nOn April 10, 2020, Microsoft released a promotional video for HoloLens 2 which featured Abramovi\u0107. However, due to accusations by right-wing conspiracy theorists of her having ties to Satanism, Microsoft eventually pulled the advertisement. Abramovi\u0107 responded to the criticism, appealing to people to stop harassing her, arguing that her performances are just the art that she has been doing for 50 years of her life.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAbramovi\u0107 claims she feels \"neither like a Serb, nor a Montenegrin\", but an ex-Yugoslav. \"When people ask me where I am from,\" she says, \"I never say Serbia.

He is known for his erotically charged images of pubescent girls, but also for the refined, dreamlike quality of his imagery.\nThroughout his career, Balthus rejected the usual conventions of the art world. He insisted that his paintings should be seen and not read about, and he resisted attempts to build a biographical profile. Nevertheless, towards the end of his life he took part in a series of dialogues with the neurobiologist Semir Zeki, conducted at his chalet at Rossini\u00e8re, Switzerland and at the Palazzo Farnese (French Embassy) in Rome. They were published in 1995 under the title La Q\u00fbete de l'essentiel, and in them he gives some of his views on art, painting and some other painters.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nBalthus was born in Paris, in 1908, to Prussian expatriate parents. His given name was Balthasar Klossowski \u2013 his sobriquet \"Balthus\" was based on his childhood nickname, alternately spelled Baltus, Baltusz, Balthusz or Balthus.\nHis father, Erich Klossowski, was an art historian who wrote a noted monograph on Honor\u00e9 Daumier. Erich grew up in the town of Ragnit in East Prussia, now part of Russia but then in the German Empire. Unlike his brother or parents, Balthus claimed that he belonged to the former Polish petty nobility (the drobna szlachta) and his family bore the Rola coat of arms. Balthus later fancifully elaborated on his family background, using the surname \"Klossowski de Rola,\" and  adding the term \"count\" to this title, which no one in his family's documented history had ever done. Balthus even had the Rola arms embroidered onto many of his kimono, in the style of a Japanese kamon.\nBalthus's mother Elisabeth Doroth\u00e9e Spiro Klossowska (known as Baladine Klossowska) was descended from Lithuanian Jews who had emigrated to East Prussia. In the catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1984 Balthus exhibition, she was described as the daughter of a cantor from Korelitz in Novogrudok district in the Russian Empire. However, Balthus told his biographer Nicholas Fox Weber that this was erroneous, and that his mother came \"apparently from a Protestant family in the south of France\". But according to Weber, this was a confabulation on Balthus's part. In fact, Balthus would often embroider upon his story of his mother's ancestry, saying that she was also related to the Romanovs and the Narischkins, powerful aristocratic families of Russia. In another confabulatory twist, Weber reports that Baladine's lover, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, had said that the Spiros were descended from one of the richest families of Sephardic Jews, that is that they were of Spanish, not Eastern European origin. Weber doubted this story too, since Balthus's son Fumio, born in the late 1960s, had Tay\u2013Sachs disease, a genetic disorder commonly associated with Eastern European Jews.\n\n \nBalthus's older brother Pierre Klossowski (1905\u20132001) became a noted writer and philosopher.\nThe Klossowski children grew up in an art-world environment, with frequent visits to their household by famous artists and writers, including Rilke, Andr\u00e9 Gide (who mentored Pierre), and Jean Cocteau (who would depict the family in scenes of his 1929 novel Les Enfants Terribles). The artists Maurice Denis and Pierre Bonnard were also visitors. The children had a Scottish nanny, and Balthus would later say that his first language was English, although his parents spoke German to one another.\nOverall, Balthus had an idyllic memory of these early childhood years, which were disrupted when, shortly after the First World War began in 1914, the family were forced to leave Paris in order to avoid deportation due to their German citizenship. They settled first in Switzerland, later in Berlin.\nIn 1917 his parents separated, and his mother moved with the two boys to Geneva. They lived in a modest flat at 11, rue Pr\u00e9-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, a comfortable neighborhood. About a year later his mother became the lover of Rilke. Rilke was very impressed with the young \"Baltusz\"'s artistic talent, and helped him to publish his first work in 1921, at the age of 13. This was a book titled Mitsou which included forty drawings by Balthus and a preface by Rilke. The comic-book-style pictures depict the story of a young boy who loses his beloved cat. The themes of the story foreshadowed Balthus's lifelong fascination with cats, along with a feeling of loss or disappearance.\nAt Christmas of 1921, Baladine, financially destitute, moved to Berlin with her children in order to live with her brother.\n\n\n=== Young adulthood ===\nIn 1926 Balthus visited Florence, where he copied many frescos by the Renaissance master Piero della Francesca. This inspired an early ambitious work of his: the tempera wall paintings of the Protestant church of the Swiss village of Beatenberg which he executed in 1927.\nFrom 1930 to 1931 Balthus served in the French army in Morocco. He was drafted into the Moroccan infantry in Kenitra and Fes, worked as a secretary, and sketched his painting La Caserne (1933).\nIn 1933 he moved to Paris, taking a studio in the Rue de Furstemberg. Later he would move to another studio at the nearby Cour de Rohan. Balthus showed no interest in modernist styles such as Cubism. His paintings were realistic but introverted, in the manner of the second generation of Surrealist painters such as Salvador Dal\u00ed, who often used realistic techniques to depict psychological motifs or dream images. Balthus often depicted pubescent girls in erotic and voyeuristic poses. One of the most notorious works from his first exhibition in Paris was The Guitar Lesson (1934), which caused controversy due to its sadistic and sexually explicit imagery. It depicts a young girl arched on her back over the lap of her female teacher, whose hands are positioned on the girl as if to play her like a guitar: one hand near her exposed vulva, and the other hand grasping her hair. Other works from the same exhibition included The Street (1933), Cathy Dressing (1933) and Alice (1933).\n\n \nEarly on his work was admired by writers and fellow painters, especially by Andr\u00e9 Breton and Pablo Picasso. His circle of friends in Paris included the novelists Pierre Jean Jouve, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Joseph Breitbach, Pierre Leyris, Henri Michaux, Michel Leiris and Ren\u00e9 Char, the photographer Man Ray, the playwright and actor Antonin Artaud, and the painters Andr\u00e9 Derain, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Alberto Giacometti (one of the most faithful of his friends). In 1948, another friend, Albert Camus, asked him to design the sets and costumes for his play L'\u00c9tat de Si\u00e8ge (The State of Siege, directed by Jean-Louis Barrault). Balthus also designed the sets and costumes for Artaud's adaptation for Percy Bysshe Shelley's The Cenci (1935), Ugo Betti's Delitto all'isola delle capre (Crime on Goat-Island, 1953) and Barrault's adaptation of Julius Caesar (1959\u20131960).\nIn 1937 he married Antoinette de Watteville, who was from an influential aristocratic family from Bern. He had met her as early as 1924, and she was the model for the aforementioned Cathy Dressing and for a series of portraits. Balthus had two children from this marriage, Stanislas (born 1942) and Thaddeus Klossowski (born 1944), who recently published books on their father, including the letters by their parents. Stanislas, known as \"Stash\", became a figure in swinging London and Paris in the 1960s.\n\n\n=== Champrovent to Chassy ===\nIn 1940, with the invasion of France by German forces, Balthus fled with his wife Antoinette to Savoy to a farm in Champrovent near Aix-les-Bains, where he began work on two major paintings: Landscape near Champrovent (1942\u20131945) and The Living Room (1942). In 1942, he escaped from Occupied France to Switzerland, first to Bern and in 1945 to Geneva, where he became a friend of the publisher Albert Skira as well as the writer and member of the French Resistance, Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Balthus returned to France in 1946 and a year later traveled with Andr\u00e9 Masson to Southern France, meeting figures such as Picasso and Jacques Lacan, who eventually became a collector of his work. With Adolphe Mouron Cassandre in 1950, Balthus designed stage decor for a production of Mozart's opera Cos\u00ec fan tutte in Aix-en-Provence. Three years later he moved into the Chateau de Chassy in the Morvan, living with his step-niece Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Tison and finishing his large-scale masterpieces La Chambre (The Room 1952, possibly influenced by Pierre Klossowski's novels) and Le Passage du Commerce Saint-Andr\u00e9 (1954).\n\n\n=== Later years ===\n\nAs international fame grew with exhibitions in the gallery of Pierre Matisse (1938) and the Museum of Modern Art (1956) in New York City, he cultivated the image of himself as an enigma. \nIn 1964, he moved to Rome where he presided over the Villa de Medici as director (appointed by the French Minister of Culture Andr\u00e9 Malraux) of the French Academy in Rome. He became a friend of the filmmaker Federico Fellini and the painter Renato Guttuso.\n\nIn 1977, he moved to Rossini\u00e8re, Switzerland. That he had a second, Japanese wife Setsuko Ideta whom he married in 1967 and was thirty-five years his junior, simply added to the air of mystery around him (he met her in Japan, during a diplomatic mission also initiated by Malraux). A son, Fumio, was born in 1968 but died two years later.\nThe photographers and friends Henri Cartier-Bresson and Martine Franck (Cartier-Bresson's wife) both portrayed the painter and his wife and their daughter Harumi (born 1973) in his Grand Chalet in Rossini\u00e8re in 1999.\nBalthus was one of the few living artists to be represented in the Louvre, when his painting The Children (1937) was acquired from the private collection of Pablo Picasso.\nHe co-authored a book of dialogues with the neurobiologist Semir Zeki, entitled La Qu\u00eate de l'essentiel.\nHe died in Rossini\u00e8re, Switzerland. Prime ministers and rock stars alike attended his funeral. Bono, lead singer of U2, sang for the hundreds of mourners at the funeral, including the President of France, the Prince Sadruddhin Aga Khan, supermodel Elle Macpherson, and Cartier-Bresson.\n\n\n=== Style and themes ===\nBalthus's style is primarily classical. His work shows numerous influences, including the writings of Emily Bront\u00eb, the writings and photography of Lewis Carroll, and the paintings of Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Simone Martini, Poussin, Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard, Joseph Reinhart, G\u00e9ricault, Ingres, Goya, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Courbet, Edgar Degas, F\u00e9lix Vallotton and Paul C\u00e9zanne. Although his technique and compositions were inspired by pre-Renaissance painters, there also are eerie intimations of contemporary surrealists like de Chirico. Painting the figure at a time when figurative art was largely ignored, he is widely recognised as an important 20th-century artist.\nMany of his paintings show young girls in an erotic context. Balthus insisted that his work was not erotic but that it recognized the discomforting facts of children's sexuality. In 2013, Balthus's paintings of adolescent girls were described by Roberta Smith in The New York Times as both \"alluring and disturbing\".\n\n\n== Influence and legacy ==\nHis work has influenced several contemporary artists, notably Duane Michals and \u00c9mile Chambon. He has also influenced the filmmaker Jacques Rivette of the French New Wave, whose film Hurlevent (1985) was inspired by Balthus's drawings made at the beginning of the 1930s: \"Seeing as he's a bit of an eccentric and all that, I am very fond of Balthus (...) I was struck by the fact that Balthus enormously simplified the costumes and stripped away the imagery trappings (...)\".\nHis widow, Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, heads the Fonds Balthus, the archives of the painter, which is accessible to scholars as a long term deposit in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lausanne.\nA reproduction of Balthus's Girl at a Window (a painting from 1957) prominently appears in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's film Domicile Conjugal (Bed and Board, 1970). The two principal characters, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) and his wife Christine (Claude Jade), are arguing. Christine takes down from the wall a small drawing of about 25\u00d725 cm and gives it to her husband: Christine: \"Here, take the small Balthus.\" Antoine: \"Ah, the small Balthus. I offered it to you, it's yours, keep it.\"\nDuring December 2017, a public petition was circulated requesting that Balthus's painting Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming be removed from display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York due to its alleged explicit content and suggestive portrayal. Philip Kennicott, writing for The Washington Post on 5 December 2017, in an article titled \"This painting might be sexually disturbing. But that's no reason to take it out of a museum\", summarized the museum's long-standing position against censorship. The painting had previously been on display at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany in 2007 without incident.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nSouth African novelist Christopher Hope wrote My Chocolate Redeemer around a painting by Balthus, The Golden Days (1944), which appears on the book jacket.\nStephen Dobyns's book The Balthus Poems (Atheneum, 1982) describes individual paintings by Balthus in 32 narrative poems.\nHarold Budd's 1988 album The White Arcades includes a track titled \"Balthus Bemused by Color\".\nRobert Dassanowsky's book Telegrams from the Metropole: Selected Poems 1980\u20131998 includes \"The Balthus Poem\".\nThomas Harris's book Hannibal (1999, Delacorte Press) says that the character Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist, cannibal, and genius, is Balthus's cousin.\nWilliam Minor's book The Balthus Poems (Coracle, 2018) is a minimalist, absurdist approach to his life and work.\nJoyce Carol Oates's 2018 book Beautiful Days: Stories contains the story \"Les beaux jours,\" which contains lyrical descriptions of Balthus's paintings and imagines the life of an eleven-year-old model of Balthus.\nMaya Hawke's 2022 single \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\" from her second studio album Moss is inspired by Balthus's painting entitled \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming\".\nThe UK print edition of Philip Pullman's short work The Collectors features Portrait de la jeune fille en costume d'amazone (1932) by Balthus as a cover image and inside print. The UK adult cover of Northern Lights (Pullman novel)  also features another work by Balthus, Girl in Green and Red (1944).\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nBalthus held his first exhibition at Galerie Pierre, Paris, in 1934. Following the ensuing scandal, he exhibited at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York, from 1938 to 1977, although he never visited the United States. Balthus's first major museum exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art in 1956. Other museum exhibitions of note include Mus\u00e9e des Arts Decoratifs, Paris (1966); Tate Gallery, London (1968); La Biennale di Venezia (1980); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1980); Mus\u00e9e cantonal des beaux-arts de Lausanne (1993); Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1984, traveled to Metropolitan Museum, Kyoto);  Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1984); and Palazzo Grassi, Venice (2001). \"Balthus: Cats and Girls: Paintings and Provocations\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (September 25, 2013 \u2013 January 12, 2014) was the first U.S. museum survey of the artist's work in 30 years. A major retrospective overseen by the artist's wife, Ideta Setsuko, was held in 2014 at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum. An exhibition of Polaroid photographs taken by Balthus at the Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany, was canceled over accusations of pedophilia. The German newspaper Die Zeit called the images, which depict a model named Anna from ages eight to 16, \u201cdocuments of pedophile greed.\u201d\nSince then, despite attempts, no planned exhibition of Balthus\u2019s work was censored or cancelled for such allegations.\n\n\n== Films on Balthus ==\nDamian Pettigrew, Balthus Through the Looking Glass (72', Super 16, PLANETE/CNC/PROCIREP, 1996). Documentary on and with Balthus filmed at work in his studio and in conversation at his Rossini\u00e8re chalet. Shot over a 12-month period in Switzerland, Italy, France and the Moors of England.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAubert, Rapha\u00ebl (2005). Le Paradoxe Balthus.

DeVille's sculptures and installations often focus on themes of the history of racist violence, gentrification, and lost regional history. Her work often involves a performance element that brings the artwork out of its exhibition space and into the streets; DeVille has organized these public events, which she calls \"processionals,\" in several U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York. Deville likes to use her own family as inspiration for her art work. She decided to use her grandmother as inspiration because of her vibrant personality, to help her articulate ideas from the neighborhoods of the Bronx. Deville is pleased that her art works are unique, as many people see trash as useless to them, while DeVille instead sees an opportunity.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDeVille was born in New York and lives and works in the Bronx, New York. DeVille tries to direct attention to historical realities that are largely unknown; she tries to illuminate truths, which people give little care or thought to, from the history of a group of people seen through the light of violence. She attended the High School of Art & Design (1999) and the Cooper Union Saturday Program. DeVille  teaches at the Maryland Institute College of Art. She earned a B.F.A. from the Fashion Institute of Technology (2007) and an M.F.A. from Yale University (2011) and studied at Pratt Institute (2000) and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (2007). She has held residencies at the Studio Museum in Harlem (2013\u20132014) and the International Studio and Curatorial Program, Brooklyn (2012).\nDeVille took part in the reality television series Artstar (2006), the first art-based reality show.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nDeVille has received awards from the Joan Mitchell Foundation (2012), the Edward and Sally Van Lier Fund of the New York Community Trust (2012), and Creative Capital (2015). In 2015, she also received the Obie Award for design for her work as a scenic and costume designer on Prophetika: An Oratorio, a production at La Mama Experimental Theatre Club. In 2016, she was awarded a Rome Prize of the American Academy in Rome (for 2017\u20132018).\n\n\n== References ==", "Wu Guanzhong (simplified Chinese: \u5434\u51a0\u4e2d; traditional Chinese: \u5433\u51a0\u4e2d; pinyin: W\u00fa Gu\u00e0nzh\u014dng; 29 August 1919 \u2013 25 June 2010) was a contemporary Chinese painter widely recognized as a founder of modern Chinese painting. He is considered to be one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. Wu's artworks display both Western and Eastern influences, such as the Western style of Fauvism and the Eastern style of Chinese calligraphy. Wu painted various aspects of China, including its architecture, plants, animals, people, as well as many of its landscapes and waterscapes, in a style reminiscent of the impressionist painters of the early 1900s. He was also a writer on contemporary Chinese art.\n\n\n== Life ==\nWu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province, in 1919. His family wanted him to become a teacher, as his father had been. In 1935, Wu passed the entrance exam and studied electrical engineering at Zhejiang Industrial School (\u6d59\u6c5f\u516c\u7acb\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e13\u95e8\u5b66\u6821, a technical school of Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou. While in engineering school, Wu met an art student named Zhu Dequn who was studying at the National Hangzhou Academy of Art.  During a trip to Zhu\u2019s school, Wu got his first look at art and fell \"madly in love\" with it. Against his father\u2019s wishes, in 1936 he transferred to the art academy, studying both Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897\u20131971), Fang Ganmin (1906\u20131984) and Li Chaoshi (1893-1971). \nWu went through many trials and challenges during his years in college before he could master his craft. In 1937 the Sino-Japanese War began and the campus had to pick up and relocate in order to get out of the way of the invading Japanese army. During the constant movement during the war, Wu was able to see many different locations. He considered the adventures as a necessary journey to becoming a man and building his character. Wu benefitted greatly from the many teachers who taught him to paint and the rough journey to becoming a man.  \nIn 1942 he graduated from Hangzhou National Academy of Art and tried to find a job. During the war jobs were hard to find and Wu took a part-time job as a substitute teacher. He later found a job as a watercolor and drawing teacher in the Architecture Department of Chongqing University.\nAfter Wu graduated he continued to hone his craft and studied with some of his old colleagues from school, like Zhu Dequn, Li Lincan and Zheng Wei. Each of these friends continued their art careers and left their mark on the art scene.  \nIn 1946 Wu applied for one of the two art study abroad spots and was the best applicant who applied; this was in part to his French language studies. 1947 traveled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts on the government scholarship. Even though France was still recovering from World War II, Wu was completely enthralled with the art he saw there. He visited all of the city's major museums within the first few days of his arrival. Wu was always a tremendous fan of French and European art. While in Europe, Wu realized that the many cultural and religious differences between Europe and China made it difficult for him to understand and appreciate some of the art. He took great interest in the modern art of France, especially Post-Impressionists such as van Gogh, Gauguin and C\u00e9zanne.  Wu loved van Gogh the most because of van Gogh\u2019s passion for art and the internal torment he endured. He also identified with the hardships that Gauguin felt when he left Paris for a South Pacific island in order to find his own personal ideal. Wu's trip to France helped him grasp the idea of form and the basic meaning of art. The study abroad trip also led to formalism becoming the basic underlying element of his art and studying in France helped him better understand formalism.\nWu returned to China in the summer of 1950 to the excitement that was brought by the new People\u2019s Republic of China government. The government assigned jobs to all of the returning students who came back after the new government took control. Everyone felt anxious and excited to contribute to the building of a new nation. Wu introduced aspects of Western art to his students at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing, where he taught from 1950 to 1953. He was excited to be the first Chinese artist to return from France with knowledge and theoretical framework for French modernism. While teaching, many peers criticized him because of jealousy over his job and because he was the only painter practicing formalism. The Academy was known to have been dominated by social realism, and Wu was called \"a fortress of bourgeois formalism\". The issues became so bad he could no longer stay at the Central Academy and transferred. Between 1953 and 1964 he taught at Tsinghua University, and then Beijing Fine Arts Normal College. As a professor Wu was able to take many trips around the country and discover the expanse that was the new China.  Wu was full of ambition and energy and travelled to many locations where his peers wouldn\u2019t go. He enjoyed the freedom of travel, which allowed him to paint or sketch wherever and whenever he wanted. This is when Wu made a transition to landscape since he travelled all over the country. He was later appointed a Professor at the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts, Beijing in 1964.\nIn August 1966, at the outset of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, Wu was prohibited from painting and writing about art, and many of his early works were destroyed. In 1970, at the age of 51, he and his wife were separated and assigned to almost 3 years of hard labor in the countryside as part of the Communist Party's vast re-education program.  Wu stated, \u201cLife was only planting rice, carrying coal, criticizing one another, and fighting one another\u2026The only thing that no one was allowed to do was paint.\u201d \nFollowing that period, he was only allowed to paint on Sundays (his day off from the fields) or on holidays.  He heard of artists being persecuted and even killed, so he burned his nude paintings since they would be severely criticized and frowned upon. Wu did not suffer too much physical harm, because he had destroyed many of his own paintings, but this caused him much emotional harm. Finally in 1972, he was allowed to return to Beijing to paint hotel murals and decorations.\nDuring the 1970s, Wu changed his style based on what others were doing at the time. He started painting with oil and watercolor in a Western style until he returned to Beijing and saw other artists using watercolor in the traditional Chinese style. In 1975 a Chinese art association in Japan wanted some traditional Chinese ink paintings to exhibit. Once again Wu changed his style to match the specifications, and his work became a great hit. From here Wu moved on to another phase where he painted with oil and concentrated on the human body and the beauty of form. Wu also realized he could achieve the same beauty and form through landscape while using Chinese ink and color on paper.\nIt was not until after Mao's death in 1976 that Wu, like many of his peers, was able to return to his art-making. This opened up the door for artists to branch out international.  Unfortunately for most of the artists, there was an immense gap in artistic ideas between China and the rest of the world.  The only one who seemed able to bridge this artistic gap was Wu. With the newfound freedom, Wu was able to break away from the old constraints and get back to the formalism style he originally loved.  Along with being able to paint again, he was able to be more of a public figure in the art scene without fear of retribution.  He wrote an essay for a May 1979 issue of Meishu titled \u201cThe Beauty of Form in Painting\u201d. He discussed his theory of formalism in the article as \n\u201cA vast number of workers in art now hope for the opening of European modern painting to them, to discuss the scientific nature of the beauty of form. It is the microscope and surgical knife of formal art as a means to enrich and develop heritage. Oil painting must be nationalized; Chinese painting must be modernized. It seems that only after we have seen the Japanese painter Higashiyama Kai\u2019s explorations have we come to have a clear understanding about the problems of uniting the East and West.\u201d \nWu has written many other articles based on his version of form and how it applies to modernism.  He considered himself primarily a painter and not a theorist. He had the approach of going out and looking at nature to find something that piqued his interest. Then he would start with a preliminary sketch of what it was that he saw. Next he spent a great deal of time in the studio trying to figure out the best way to show the power of the form of the object. He would then paint quickly and impulsively with whatever European of Chinese brush felt right. Wu would go on painting for hours until he was too emotionally drained to continue.\nHe had his first professional solo exhibition in 1979, and his career took off in the 1980s.  He has been the solo exhibitionist in over ten and been part of a joint exhibition in over ten others.\nIn 1991 Wu was made an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.\nEarly in his career Guanzhong adopted the pen name Tu, which he used to sign his work.\nWu died at the age of 90, during the night of June 25, 2010, in Beijing Hospital.\n\n\n== Paintings ==\n\n\n=== Twin Swallows ===\nAmong many of Wu Guanzhong\u2019s paintings, Twin Swallows was the most outstanding and representative of his search for a synthesis of Western elements into traditional Chinese painting. It is a painting that captures both the static form of traditional Jiangnan architecture and the motion of two swallows as they fly toward a tree. Geometric shapes, especially rectangles, dominate half of the painting. For example, the front walls of the houses are horizontally placed white rectangles with simple black and gray lines to depict the edges and rooftop of each building. Doorways were painted in the same minimalistic manner, yet the contrast between the darkness inside the building with the lighter door frame is prominent enough to create a sense of depth. Wu\u2019s attention to perspective and depth in Twin Swallow is a factor that distinguishes himself from many other traditional guohua painters. Although the white walls in Twin Swallows may seem like the dominating elements in this painting, it is in fact the pair of swallows that reveals Wu\u2019s intention behind this painting. In the 1950s, Wu returned from France to his homeland. It was also a time when Chinese art entered the phase of socialist realism. This artistic movement had encouraged many artists to create artwork in order to contribute to the Chinese society. Similarly, Wu felt obligated to pass on the knowledge that he had gained in France to the younger generations in China in order to promote the idea of a synthesis among Western and traditional Chinese art.\n\n\n=== Lion Grove Garden ===\nLion Grove Garden was painted in 1983. The subject of this painting, Lion Grove, is the largest rockery in Suzhou. Wu Guanzhong had successfully incorporated the use of lines, planes, and dots in this painting. The lines were used to express a sense of freedom, which was also what Chinese artists enjoyed after the Cultural Revolution. Unlike traditional guohua artists, Wu\u2019s ink outlines no longer suggest the physical form of the rocks, but instead seem to suggest how Wu perceive this landscape. The forms of the rocks are shaped in diverse ways, some being round, uneven, and hollow. He paid careful attention to the ups and downs, concave and convex, caverns and peaks, and sizes of the rocks. Although the structure of the rockery is hardly identifiable in this painting, this sense of ambiguity further encourages viewers to use their imagination and look beyond what is presented in front of their eyes. About two-thirds of the paintings consist of sinuous lines and splashes of ink and colored dots, of green, yellow, purple and red, that reinforces the spontaneity and fluidity of the painting as each dot sparkles across the painting. Artistic element of planes, such as the rooftop of Suzhou-style pavilion, the bridge, and the cloister add a hint of realistic element. The foreground of this painting is a lightly shaded pale grey water where the fish reside. Although the foreground isn\u2019t as eye-catching as the rockery, it grounds the complex elements in a stable dimension.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nMost of Wu\u2019s early works were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  It is difficult to track down works from his early days.  Wu had an exhibit in 1942 when he was in school and it was hosted by the Sha Ping Youth Palace.\nWu Guanzhong has had solo exhibitions in major art galleries and museums around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, Korea, France, England and the USA. His paintings were exhibited at the British Museum in 1992; Wu was the first living Chinese artist to have an exhibition there. One of his paintings, Seascape at Beidaihe (1977), was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of an exhibition of paintings from the collection of art dealer Robert H. Ellsworth [1].   His work may also be seen in the collection of the Hong Kong Museum of Art.\nIn 2008, Wu donated 113 works to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). This donation is the largest Wu Guanzhong donation to a public museum.  In 2010, Wu donated works to the Hong Kong Art Museum.\n\n\n== Quotes by Wu Guanzhong ==\n\u201cThrough painting landscapes I have grown to love my motherland even more and wish to be forever intoxicated in her embrace.\u201d \nThis particular quote gives us deeper insight to the deep appreciation for China and the land that Wu Guanzhong had.\n\u201cFor people\u2019s hearts to communicate, there must be genuine emotion to strike a chord. Whether the feelings and perceptions of modern Chinese can find resonance in the West depends on the emotions, if they are true or false. Intelligent viewers can discern what is real and what is false.\u201d \nHere, Wu Guanzhong explains that in order for people (such as those of the East and the West) to communicate there must be real emotions that can strike a chord with the other's audience.\n\u201cAbstract beauty is the heart of the beauty of figurative art. It is a natural thing to which we all respond. As a child loves to play with a kaleidoscope, so everyone likes pure form and color.\u201d \nWu Guanzhong explains abstract beauty, which shows his appreciation for abstract art along with his traditional Chinese training.\n\"So often there is conflict between them, and this is my greatest sorrow....Whatever I have written is to try to help our own people to understand and to get rid of their fear and suspicion of abstraction in Western art. So I can only start talking from a point of semi-abstract art, which is easier to understand. But even when I talked this away, recently there were lots of argument and objections.\u201d \nThis specific quote shows how difficult it was in China to integrate abstract Western art as a result of their fears and how this impedes Wu Guanzhong's ability to freely discuss it.\n\u201c\u2019Image\u2019 exists in the objective world. Not all images are beautiful. The discerning power of the artists eye lies in its ability to recognize the beauty in images, to grasp the elements that constitute this beauty, and to bring this beauty out in his expression, thus creating a sense of sympathy in the audience!\u201d\nThis quote explains Wu Guanzhong's belief that the audience should feel a sense of sympathy with the painting.\n\u201cIn searching for all the marvelous peaks to make sketches, for thirty years during winter, summer, spring, and autumn, I carried on my back the heavy painting equipment and set foot in the river towns, mountain villages, thick forests, and snowy peaks \u2013 from the farthest corner of the Eastern Sea to the border towns of Tibet, from the ruins of ancient Greek Gaochang (in Xinjiang) to the isles of seagulls, I stayed in truck stops, courtyards of fishermen\u2019s homes, factory buildings, and broken temples....In all of these I trained myself to develop endurance.\u201d \nWe see through this quote Wu Guanzhong's struggles on his journey of becoming a landscape painter and how this resulted in him becoming stronger.\nAll of the above quotes are from the same source\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWu Guanzhong and his paintings at China Online Museum\nDavid Barbosa, Once denounced, painter has China's eye, The New York Times, 6 October 2005.", "Monika Weiss (born 1964, in Warsaw) is a Polish-American contemporary artist based in New York City. She works primarily with Installation, video projection, performance, sound and drawing. Her transdisciplinary approach investigates relationships between body and history, and evokes ancient rituals of lamentation.\n\n\n== Education ==\nWeiss, the daughter of a concert pianist, studied piano and classical music from 1970-1984. She attended The Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw from 1984-1989, where she studied painting and drawing under Ryszard Winiarski, Stefan Gierowski and Marian Czapla. She was an Artist in Residence at The Academy of Fine Arts In \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1994-1995), Spelman College in Atlanta (1996), the Georgia State University School of Art and Design (1997-1998), The University of Maryland (1999) and at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago (2002).\n\n\n== Career ==\nWeiss's early works from the 1980s and early 90s consisted mostly of drawings and paintings of human figures. The drawings were made with ink mixed with paint and she often built collages on large sheets of paper from them. Later the artist's work expanded to include installations, video and sound projects.\nHer work has been exhibited in over twenty solo exhibitions and numerous group exhibitions internationally. In 2005, Lehman College Art Gallery organized and published a retrospective of the artist's work since 1999, Monika Weiss: Five Rivers. In 2006, Weiss was commissioned to create Drawing Lethe at the World Financial Center, a large scale public project curated by the Drawing Center in New York. Her work has been featured at Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation CIFO, Miami (Forms of Classification: Alternative Knowledge and Contemporary Art, 2007; The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma: Selections from the Ella Fontanals-Cisneros Collection, 2009), and she was part of Prague's Muzeum Montanelli (MuMo)\u2019s inaugural show in 2010.\nSome other notable exhibitions include Moment by Moment: Meditations of the Hand at North Dakota Museum of Art, Grand Forks (2006); On the Absence of Camps at Kunsthaus Dresden (2006); POZA: On the Polishness of Polish Contemporary Art at Real Art Ways, Hartford (2008); and Frauen bei Olympia at Frauenmuseum, Bonn (2009). Weiss has exhibited alongside and collaborated with artists such as Carolee Schneemann, Mona Hatoum, Francis Alys, and Stephen Vitiello among others.\nWeiss has given lectures on her work at institutions around the world and her writings have appeared in numerous publications, including New Realities: Being Syncretic (Springer, Wien/New York) and Technoetic Arts (Intellect, London).\nIn 2009 she received the New York Foundation for the Arts award in the interdisciplinary art category. She splits her time between New York and St. Louis, where she is an associate professor at the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis and faculty affiliate in the Performing Arts Department.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Lamentation ===\nA recurring motif in the artist\u2019s work is the exploration of the ancient ritual of lament. Group mourning, she states, is more than a response to a specific grief; it can act as a political force. Historically a feminine expression, lamentation stands \"in opposition to heroic, masculine fantasies of conquest and power.\" Through lamentation she draws attention to the complexities of history, incorporating \"those who have been perennially absent: the victims and the defeated.\" According to art critic Adriana Valdes, lamentation is both an expression and a silence; it lacks articulation. Weiss's work focuses on this lack of articulation, \"the moment when language collapses in face of the loss of the ability to signify.\"\n\n\n=== Body ===\nWeiss uses her body as an artistic tool, as a vehicle and a palette. Often she employs her body in repetitive and monotonous movements within specific limitations, such as submerging herself at long lengths in a concrete receptacle filled with water (Ennoia) or by rolling around, tracing her silhouette on materials such as sheets of canvas (Leukos) or a bed of books (Phlegethon-Milczenie).\n\n\n=== Performance ===\nHer performances lack dramaturgical plot. They are noted for their syncopated rhythms, which serve to \u201cboth disrupt and, paradoxically, prolong time.\u201d She \u201cprovides an alternative experience of space and time, which is not end-driven but steady and enduring.\u201d\n\n\n=== Drawing ===\nDrawing has been described as the touchstone of her art. It often ties together the various aspects of her art, the technological with the corporeal, the communal with the solitary.\n\n\n== Featured works ==\n\n\n=== Ennoia ===\nEnacted in 2002 at the Diapason Gallery in New York, the installation involved the artist immersing herself in a concrete basin full of water, emerging only periodically throughout the 6-hour duration of the performance. A camera suspended from the ceiling recorded the performance and the image of her submerged, curled up body was projected on a nearby wall, accompanied by sounds from below the surface of the water. As described by critic James D. Campbell, \u201cThe artist seemed to meld her own body to the contours of the water-filled sculpted basin in which it was submersed as though it were a secondary skin; a shell-like armature for her vulnerable body, providing protection. Like an embryo in vitro, the font was interpretable as exoskeleton containing a nourishing vat of amniotic fluid, replete with the waters of her life.\u201d\n\n\n=== Leukos ===\n\u201cLeukos\u201d was an outdoor performance installation created on the grounds of Lehman College in the Bronx. It was part of a series of works titled \u201cIntervals,\u201d in which drawings were made by the artist and other participants by tracing their bodies. Over the course of two days the artist and other contributors rolled around on large sheets of cotton, for several hours at a time, tracing their silhouettes with crayons, graphite, and pigments, while wind and rain darkened and blurred the drawings. The cotton canvas was then installed in the gallery with a video of the performance projected on the wall behind it, accompanied by a soundtrack of opera arias. The New York Times wrote of the piece: \u201cPartly, the work helps make us look at and think differently about the body, as an inert object, and partly it is all about collapsing together artistic genres - sculpture, installation, performance and drawing - in a way so wayward as to almost obviate art altogether.\u201d\n\n\n=== Phlegethon \u2013 Milczenie ===\nFor this installation in Potsdam, books - philosophical and literary publications from pre-war Germany \u2013 served as objects on which the artist crawled and drew, outlining her body while her eyes remained shut. In an adjacent room a continuous video was projected, based on the performance. In a review for The Gazette (Montreal), Henry Lehmann wrote, \u201cSomething that happens in Weiss's work, in what seems an objective manner, is that at some point the books quit being just books and become primarily art forms. They no longer ask to be read, but ask rather that we bear witness to their existence and perhaps see their yellowing pages as measures of time.\u201d\n\n\n=== Sustenazo ===\nFirst installed in the cellars of the Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw, the multi-media installation was inspired by an event that took place at the castle shortly after the onset of the Warsaw Uprising. In August 1944, the occupying German army ordered an immediate evacuation of nearly two thousand hospital patients. Many of the seriously ill patients died shortly thereafter. Weiss used original documents related to the hospital's evacuation along with other images and sounds. In the video, voices in Polish are broken up, overlaid with voices in German. An eighty-year-old Polish woman, who was a young nurse at the hospital, tells the story of her experience in Polish while another woman's voice reads passages in German from Faust II. The title, Sustenazo, is a Greek word, meaning \u201cto sigh, to lament inaudibly together.\u201d In her own words, \u201cThe act of \u2018throwing out\u2019 a hospital contradicts everything a hospital ought to be: a place where human lives are saved. Sustenazo evokes that event as a metaphor for war in general.\u201d\nThe artist does not perform in Sustenazo and has not performed in other recent works as to avoid autobiographical interpretations. She also stresses that it is not solely about Polish or European history either. She explains, \u201cIt is more broadly about the loss of lives inflicted by war and by other political and organized acts of violence and oppression. For me, war is not only devastating: it is unacceptable.\u201d \nBeginning in December 2012 one of the three videos from the exhibition, Sustenazo (Lament II), is being exhibited at the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, Chile in a solo exhibition that includes an installation from antique books, medical instruments and artist's drawings. An accompanying catalogue of essays and interviews, Monika Weiss: Sustenazo (Lament II), was published in conjunction with the show.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtist\u2019s website", "Robert Graham (August 19, 1938 \u2013 December 27, 2008) was a Mexican-born American sculptor based in the state of California in the United States. His monumental bronzes commemorate the human figure, and are featured in public places across America.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGraham was born in Mexico City, Mexico on August 19, 1938, to Roberto Pena and Adelina Graham. Roberto Pena died when his son was six years old, and the boy, his mother Adelina, his grandmother Ana, and his aunt Mercedes left Mexico and moved to San Jose, California.\nRobert Graham received his formal art training at San Jos\u00e9 State University and the San Francisco Art Institute. He continued his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute in California, finishing in 1964.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBy the late 1960s, Graham had one-man exhibitions of his sculpture at important contemporary art galleries in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Cologne, and Essen, Germany. He, along with family members Joey and Steven, lived in London for a period before settling in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. His first solo exhibition in a museum was at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1972. Since then he has had dozens of one-man shows, including several at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\nGraham used a range of materials and scales in his work. In the 1970s he created very small wax sculptures (circa 4 inches (10 cm)) in miniature dioramas, depicting people interacting in various contemporary environments, such as a living room or a beach scene.  Some of these interactions included sexual congress. Graham's 1986 monument to the boxer Joe Louis is a 24-foot (7.3 m) bronze fist and forearm. He has created hundreds of nude figures and groupings in intermediate scales.\nGraham's first major monumental commission was the ceremonial gateway for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the occasion of the 1984 Olympics. He also designed the commemorative silver dollar for the event. The gateway featured two bronze torsos, male and female, modeled on contestants in the games. The gateway was a major design element of an Olympiad noted for its lack of new construction. To the surprise of many, the nudity of the torsos became an issue in the media.\nAfter 1984, Graham received many other commissions for monumental works, such as The Great Bronze Doors of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles (2002).\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGraham married his first wife Joey Graham in 1959. They have one son, Steven, born in 1963.\nHe married actress Anjelica Huston in 1992, and they resided in an unusual dwelling in Venice, Los Angeles. Huston refused to move to the bohemian area, where he'd been living for years, unless Graham designed a custom home that balanced security with beauty. The result was a remarkable home behind a long, solid cement wall to separate them from the well-traveled sidewalks: it was nicknamed the fortress.\nGraham made a cameo appearance in Huston's movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, as the Venezuelan general near the beginning of the film standing on the deck of the ship. Wes Anderson mentions in the movie's commentary that Graham has some aspects in common with Steve Zissou.\nHe was interviewed in Visiting... with Huell Howser Episode 411.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nIn 1983, Graham was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008, that Graham would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place on December 15, 2008, but he was too ill to attend. His son Steven accepted the award on his behalf as he was inducted alongside 11 other legendary Californians.\n\n\n== Death ==\nAfter an illness of about six months, Graham died on December 27, 2008, at Santa Monica \u2013 UCLA Medical Center, in Los Angeles. His funeral was held at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which has bronze doors that Graham created for the cathedral.

McGinley began making photographs in 1998. In 2003, at the age of 25, he was one of the youngest artists to have a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was named Photographer of the Year in 2003 by American Photo Magazine. In 2007, McGinley was awarded the Young Photographer Infinity Award by the International Center of Photography. In 2009, he was honored at The Young Collectors Council's Artists Ball at the Guggenheim Museum. A 2014 GQ article declared McGinley, \"the most important photographer in America.\"\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMcGinley was born in Ramsey, New Jersey, and is the youngest of eight children. From an early age his peers and mentors were skateboarders, graffiti artists, musicians, and artists that were considered to be on the fringes of society. As a teenager, McGinley was a snowboard instructor at Campgaw Mountain, NJ, and competed in the east coast amateur circuits from 1992 to 1995. He enrolled as a graphic design student at Parsons School of Design in New York in 1997. In 1998, he moved to the East Village, and covered the walls of his apartment with Polaroid pictures of everyone who visited him there.\n\n\n== Work ==\nAs a student at Parsons, McGinley began experimenting with photography. In 1999, he put these early images together in a handmade, self-published book called The Kids Are Alright, titled after a film about The Who. McGinley had his first public exhibition in 2000 at 420 West Broadway in Manhattan in a DIY opening. One copy of The Kids Are Alright was given to scholar and curator Sylvia Wolf, who later organized McGinley's solo exhibition at the Whitney. In an essay about McGinley, Wolf wrote, \"The skateboarders, musicians, graffiti artists and gay people in Mr. McGinley's early work 'know what it means to be photographed. [...] His subjects are performing for the camera and exploring themselves with an acute self-awareness that is decidedly contemporary. They are savvy about visual culture, acutely aware of how identity can be not only communicated but created. They are willing collaborators.\" While he was a student at Parsons, McGinley was also the acting photo editor at Vice magazine from 2000 to 2002.\nMcGinley has been long time friends with fellow Lower Manhattan artists Dan Colen and the late Dash Snow. McGinley said of Snow, \"I guess I get obsessed with people, and I really became fascinated by Dash.\"\nAriel Levy, writing in New York magazine about McGinley's friend and collaborator, Snow, said, \"People fall in love with McGinley\u02bcs work because it tells a story about liberation and hedonism: Where Goldin and Larry Clark were saying something painful and anxiety producing about Kids and what happens when they take drugs and have sex in an ungoverned urban underworld, McGinley started out announcing that 'The Kids Are Alright,' fantastic, really, and suggested that a gleeful, unfettered subculture was just around the corner\u2014'still'\u2014if only you knew where to look.\"\nMcGinley's early work was primarily shot on 35mm film and using Yashica T4s and Leica R8s. Since 2004, McGinley's style has evolved from documenting his friends in real-life situations towards creating envisioned situations that can be photographed. He casts his subjects at rock \u2018n\u2019 roll festivals, art schools, and street castings in cities. In describing the essence of youth and adventure central to McGinley's work, Jeffrey Kluger wrote in TIME, \"Photography is about freezing a moment in time; McGinley's is about freezing a stage in a lifetime. Young and beautiful is as fleeting as a camera snap\u2014 and thus all the more worth preserving.\" In 2007, critic Philip Gefter wrote, \"He was a fly on the wall. But then he began to direct the activities, photographing his subjects in a cinema-verite mode. 'I got to the point where I couldn't wait for the pictures to happen anymore,' he said. 'I was wasting time, and so I started making pictures happen. It borders between being set up or really happening. There's that fine line.'\" This transition to creating work with an emphasis on heavy pre-production is embodied in McGinley's famous summer cross-country road trip series. In a 2014 feature, GQ wrote, \"His road trips, legendary among city-dwelling creatives under 30 (they all know someone who knows someone who went on one), have been annual summer occasions for almost a decade. McGinley and his assistants start planning the journey in January. They consult maps, newspapers, travel books. It usually starts with a specific desire\u2014wanting to shoot kids in a cypress tree with Spanish moss, say\u2014and the trip itself is plotted according to where such a setting can be found.\" As McGinley continued this series, he began incorporating different elements into his photos, such as shooting with fireworks, animals, and in extreme locations like caves.\nIn conversation with filmmaker Gus Van Sant, McGinley described his practice of making photographs on the road and outside of his New York City based studio, \"Such a big part of what I do is removing myself and other people from the city. Taking people to these beautiful and remote locations, being together for long periods of time, getting that intimacy, and doing all these intense activities together every day. In a way, it's like a bizarre summer camp or like touring in a rock band or traveling circus. It's all those things combined. Just taking everyone out of their element so you have their full attention.\"\nIn 2009, McGinley returned to the studio as he began experimenting within the confines of traditional studio portraiture. This was also the beginning of what would by 2010 become an all entirely digital photography practice. The result was his 2010 exhibition, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, at Team Gallery in NYC, where he displayed his first collection of black and white nudes. This series marked a significant shift in the style and production of McGinley's photographs. His continued work within the realm of digital studio portraiture eventually evolved into his Yearbook series. Team Gallery describes the 2014 installation as, \"(...) a single artwork that consists of over five hundred studio portraits of some two hundred models, always in the nude, printed on vinyl and adhered to every available inch of the gallery's walls and ceilings. The installation's effect is hugely impressive in its standalone visual power, an enveloping entity flooding the entire space with bold color and form. Although the sheer abundance of available images renders a total \"reading\" impossible, there is never any sense of incompleteness, as each individual image functions autonomously, granting the viewer access to a delicate, once-private moment.\" Yearbook is a traveling exhibition, and while it has evolved in size and application process, it has been exhibited internationally in various forms in San Francisco, Amersfoort, Basel, and Tokyo.\nThroughout his career, McGinley has worked with various high-profile charities. Influenced by the death of his brother in 1995 due to HIV/AIDS-related complications, McGinley is vocally passionate about raising funds for HIV/AIDS awareness and treatment research. At the 2014 amfAR Gala, a photograph donated by McGinley was purchased by Miley Cyrus, who narrowly outbid Tom Ford, for a record breaking price. Also in 2014 McGinley photographed Ines Rau, a transgender person, fully nude for a spread in Playboy magazine called \"Evolution.\"\nIn recent years, McGinley has become well known for the circle of successful younger artists surrounding him and his studio, prompting the New York Times to refer to him as, \"The Pied Piper of the Downtown Art World\". McGinley describes his mentorship practices as, \"In a way, it's a curriculum, as I can give people advice because I\u2019ve been through it.\"\nIn 2014, McGinley delivered the commencement address at Parsons School of Design. To graduating students he offered the advice, \"Say yes to almost everything and try new things. Don't be afraid to fail, and don't be afraid to work hard. Do your pictures\u2014don't try and do somebody else's pictures. Don't get lost inside your head, and don't worry what camera you\u2019re using.\" He continued, \"I once heard the legendary indie director Derek Jarman had three rules for making his art films: 'Show up early, hold your own light, and don\u2019t expect to get paid.' That always stuck with me. Approach art like it's your job. Show up for photography every day for eight hours. Take it as seriously as a doctor would medicine.\" Since 2005, McGinley has periodically lectured and done critiques with MFA photography students at Yale University. He has also been a member of the School of Visual Arts Mentors program.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nMcGinley is credited for the formation of the New York City based band The Virgins after introducing and photographing two of its members in Tulum in 2004. McGinley said of the band, \"Their lyrics are really poetic and very much about New York and the life that we live.\"\nIn 2008, the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur R\u00f3s used one of McGinley's images for their fifth album Me\u00f0 su\u00f0 \u00ed eyrum vi\u00f0 spilum endalaust. The video for the first track from the album, \"Gobbledigook\", was inspired by his work. In 2012, McGinley reunited with the band to direct the video for \"Var\u00fa\u00f0\". The non-profit Art Production Fund partnered with the NYC Taxi Commission to show the film in 3,000 cabs. The following year, it was screened in Times Square as part of Art Production Fund's Midnight Moment series, in which every night at midnight for one month the video played simultaneously on electronic billboards and newspaper kiosks throughout Times Square.\nMcGinley has photographed musicians for both album artwork and editorial projects. In 2012, he provided the artwork for Bat for Lashes's album The Haunted Man. In 2013, he created images for Katy Perry's fourth studio album, Prism. He had also photographed musicians Beyonce for BEAT Magazine, Lady Gaga for Rolling Stone, and Lorde for Dazed and Confused.\n\n\n=== Commercial and Editorial work ===\nMcGinley has contributed editorial assignments to The New York Times Magazine, including his 2004 Olympic Swimmers, 2008 Oscars Portfolio, and 2010 Winter Olympics.\nHe has worked in fashion editorial and advertising. In 2009, McGinley helped launch Levi's \"Go Forth\" campaign. In 2012 and 2013, he worked with U2 singer Bono on producing a short film and photographs for fashion brand EDUN. Additionally, he has made photographs for beauty and fragrance campaigns by Calvin Klein, Dior, Herm\u00e8s, and Stella McCartney.\nMcGinley has also been featured as a model in campaigns by The Gap, Marc Jacobs, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Uniqlo.\n\n\n=== Short films ===\n2010: Friends Forever\n2010: Entrance Romance\n2010: Pringle of Scotland \u2013 Spring Summer 2010, with Tilda Swinton (7:59 min.)\n2012: Beautiful Rebels\n2012: Var\u00fa\u00f0, for Sigur R\u00f3s\n2012: The Virgins: Prima Materia\n2013: Mind of its own, for Mercedes-Benz\n2015: We Three, with David Armstrong and Jack Pierson\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIn 2003, the Whitney Museum gave McGinley a solo show as part of their First Exposure series. He has also had solo shows at MoMA P.S.1 in New York (2004), and at the MUSAC in Leon, Spain (2005). In 2005, he was the laureate of the Rencontres d'Arles Discovery Award.\nIn 2007 McGinley exhibited Irregular Regulars at Team Gallery in SoHo. Art critic David Velasco, in his review of the show, wrote, \"McGinley went on a two-year road trip, traveling to dozens of Morrissey concerts in the US, the UK, and Mexico. The resultant photos, many of which are densely saturated in the concerts\u2019 colored lights, feature candid shots of fans, regularly zooming in for seductive close-ups of enamored youngsters\u2014a celebration of the ecstatic cult of fame and its ardent enablers.\"\nIn 2008 he exhibited I Know Where the Summer Goes, also at Team Gallery. Kluger, writing in Time magazine, said, \"But his favorite subject remains youth, as his 2008 exhibit, 'I Know Where the Summer Goes,' proves. In that collection, McGinley's troupe travels the country as he photographs them, sometimes clothed and often not, while they leap fences, lounge in a desert, play together in a tree.\"\nIn 2010, McGinley debuted his first collection of black and white studio nudes, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, at Team Gallery in New York. Later in 2010, McGinley's exhibition Life Adjustment Center was held at Ratio 3 in San Francisco. There he debuted two new portfolios of black and white portraits and color photographs.\nIn 2012, McGinley had simultaneous shows at Team Gallery's two SoHo locations. Animals and Grids juxtaposed two new series of photographs: nudes with animals and large grids of intimate portraits of young concert-goers.\nIn 2013, McGinley exhibited his largest project to date,Yearbook. A collection of hundreds of colorful studio portraits but conceived as a single artwork, the installation covered every available inch of the walls of San Francisco's Ratio 3. In 2014, the exhibition grew larger, this time staged at Team Gallery. Yearbook continued to travel in 2015, showing at Kunsthal kAdE in Amersfoort and Art Unlimited at Art Basel.\nIn 2015, McGinley's work further departed from his summer road trip series with bicoastal exhibitions Fall and Winter, at Team Gallery's SoHo and Venice Beach locations.\nMcGinley's work was also featured in the Guggenheim Museum's 2015 exhibition, Storylines. The show was described as \"an expansive view of the new paradigms for storytelling forged during the past ten years to communicate ideas about race, gender, sexuality, history, and politics, among other trenchant themes.\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nMcGinley's work is held in the following public collections:\n\nSolomon R.

Her work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions and is held in the permanent collections of many major museums. Her media include painting, works on paper, film and video. Some of her pieces refer to issues of race, and may combine formality with racial stereotypes and depict \"ordering principles\" society imposes.\n\n\n== Background and education ==\nGallagher was born on December 16, 1965, in Providence, Rhode Island. Referred to as African American, she is of biracial ethnicity; her father's heritage was from Cape Verde, in Western Africa (but he was born in the United States), and her mother's background was Caucasian Irish Catholic. Gallagher's mother was a working-class Irish-American and her father was a professional boxer.\nIn Rhode Island, Gallagher attended Moses Brown, an elite, Quaker college preparatory school. At sixteen, Gallagher entered her first year at Oberlin College in Ohio (1982\u20131984) and studied writing. Gallagher did not finish her education at Oberlin College and ended up joining a carpenters' union in Seattle. Before her art career, Gallagher worked as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and Maine. In 1989 she attended Studio 70 in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, before earning a degree in fine arts from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1992. Her art education further continued in 1993 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGallagher gained recognition as an artist in 1995. Prior to her Gagosian showing, Gallagher had solo shows at Mary Boone in Soho, New York, and Anthony D'Offay in London. As her first solo show in New York, Gallagher chose Mary Boone's space because of its neutrality, in which she stated, \"because there the abstract qualities of my work stand out first\".\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nGallagher is an abstract painter and multimedia artist creating minimalist work with subject narratives. Gallagher's influences include the paintings of Agnes Martin and the repetitive writings of Gertrude Stein. Some of Gallagher's work involves repetitively modifying advertising found in African American focused publications such as Ebony, Sepia, and Our World, including images from Valmor Products ads, as in her DeLuxe series. Her most famous pieces are her grid-like collages of magazines grouped together into larger pieces. Examples of these are eXelento (2004), Afrylic (2004), and DeLuxe (2005). The series DeLuxe showed multiple creative methods, from photogravure to digital printing. Gallagher used oils to combine different sheets together and add texture. Gallagher pushed the limit between two and three dimensions in her series. She used new technologies to create plates in many layers. Each of these works contains as many as or more than 60 prints employing techniques of photogravure, spit-bite, collage, cutting, scratching, silkscreen, offset lithography and hand-building. Gallagher also glues notebook paper drawings onto her canvas to create textured surfaces.\nIn her artwork, she combines different traits of three art movements. Two of them mentioned by her are Abstract expressionism and Minimalism., but by observing her use of specific materials like magazines, newspapers, etc. The use of patterns and repetition series as well as the many printing techniques she uses can relate to her work with Pop-art. With stylized allusions to cartoons and childhood toys or via transformed and manipulated advertisements Gallagher's work \u201cseduces the viewer into visceral engagement with images about which we have learned to feel numb.\nEven though Gallagher does not describe her artwork as any of these art styles individually, not only her but other art-related individuals and regular audiences describe Gallagher's work as singular and interesting. Very contrasting styles combined to give life to meticulously unique Pop-abstract-minimalist artworks\nSome of Gallagher's early influences while attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston were the Darkroom Collective, a group of poets living and working out of Inman Square in Cambridge, MA and would go on to become the art coordinator of the collective. The Darkroom collective allowed Gallagher to explore her talent and apply her culture as an African-American woman to her work. One of her first exhibits took place at the Dark Room in 1989. Some other influences at the Museum School were Susan Denker, Ann Hamilton, Kiki Smith and Laylah Ali.\n\nThemes related to race are often evident in Gallagher's work, sometimes using pictographs, symbols, codes and repetitions. \"Sambo lips\" and \"bug eyes,\" references to the Black minstrel shows, are often scattered throughout Gallagher's works. Additionally, Gallagher would use these symbols in her collage pieces, inspired by lined yellow paper schoolchildren use. Certain characters are also used repeatedly, such as the image of the nurse or the \"Pegleg\" character that sometimes populate her page's iconography. Gallagher made Wiglette from Deluxe 2004 to 2005, which contains a collection of vintage beauty ads from the 1930s to 70s intended for black American women. Through this art piece Ellen Gallagher is once again exploring the intersection of identity, race and culture. When asked about Wiglette in an interview Gallagher said, \u201cThe wig ladies are fugitives. Conscripts from another time and place, liberated from the 'race' magazines of the past. But I transformed them-here on the pages that once held them captive.\u201d  Some of her pieces may explicitly reference the issue of race while also having a more subtle undercurrent related to race. She was inspired by the New Negro movement as well as modernist abstraction. Gallagher also uses found historical images in her work. She combines formality (grid lines, ruled paper) with the racial stereotypes to depict the \"ordering principles\" society imposes.\"Blackface minstrel is a ghost story, \" Gallagher has noted. \"It's about loss; there's a black mask and sublimation...[B]lackface minstrel was the first great American abstraction, even before jazz. It's the literal recording of the African body into American public culture. Disembodied eyes and lips float, hostage, in the electric black of the minstrel stage, distorting the African body into American blackface.\" As well as using racially charged imagery, Gallagher is known to portray bodies and include elements of poetry and pop culture in her work. She uses golden tones to portray the racial binary in society. Her media includes paintings, works on paper, film and video. She has made innovative use of materials, such as creating a unique variation on scrimshaw by carving images into the surface of thick sheets of watercolor paper and drawing with ink, watercolor and pencil. Her extensive ongoing series begun in 2001 and titled, Watery Ecstatic, consists of paintings, sculptural objects, and animations to depict sea life through Afrofuturist aesthetics. Gallagher creates different sea creatures to symbolize slave ancestors who died during the transatlantic slave trade across the Atlantic Ocean. These works depict sea creatures, of the mythical undersea world of Drexciya, which were the progeny of slaves who had drowned. This mythology had been conceived by a musical duo of that name, from Detroit. Gallagher commented upon the process of creating these pieces: \"The way that these drawings are made is my version of scrimshaw, the carving into bone that sailors did when they were out whaling. I imagine them in this overwhelming, scary expanse of sea where this kind of cutting would give a focus, a sense of being in control of something.\" Some of Gallagher's work would also consist of codes made from cut out letters. In some of her early pieces, she painted and drew on sheets of penmanship paper (ruled paper used for handwriting practice) she had pasted onto canvas. Her choice of penmanship paper is significant, in an interview with Jessica Morgan, she says \"the sense of a neutral surface that can accommodate any mark seems an ideal way of communicating freedom,\" which is described by her as \"idiosyncratic\" and \"inscrutable\". As her previous work has been critiqued for being too racially charged, her newer work contains less explicit racial images to challenge viewers.\nIn 1995, Gallagher's work was exhibited at the Whitney Biennial and the Venice Biennale in 2003. Artist Chuck Close created a 2009 tapestry portrait of Gallagher. Gallagher is represented by Gagosian Gallery (New York) and Hauser & Wirth (London). She is based in the United States (New York City) and the Netherlands (Rotterdam).\n\n\n== Awards and fellowships ==\nAmong the honors that Gallagher has earned are:\n\nAnn Gund Scholarship, Skowhegan School of Art, Skowhegan, ME (1993)\nTraveling Scholar Award, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA (1993)\nProvincetown Fine Arts Work Center Fellow (1995)\nMacDowell Colony, New Hampshire (1996)\nJoan Mitchell Fellowship (1997)\nAmerican Academy Award in Art (2000)\nMedal of Honor, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2001)\nElected Honorary Royal Academician (HonRA) (2021)\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\nEllen Gallagher's work has been featured in solo exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions including:\n\nDrawing Center, New York City, Preserve (2001)\nInstitute of Contemporary Art, Boston USA, \"Watery Ecstatic\" (2001)\n\n\n== Publications ==\nMurmur.

He has contributed to the New York School of painting since the late 1960s. Viewed as a member of the Third Generation of American Abstract Expressionists, his work is associated with Abstract Expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, Process Art, \nPostminimalism, Bio-morphic Cubism (a term he coined) and Color Field painting.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThornton Willis's father, Willard Willis, was an evangelical preacher in the Church of Christ.  Willis spent formative years in Montgomery Alabama, returning to graduate from Tate High School in Pensacola, Florida.  After three years in the United States Marine Corps, Thornton Willis studied, under the G.I. Bill, at Auburn University for one year transferring to the University of Southern Mississippi where he graduated with a B.A. in 1962.  In the summer of 1964, he enrolled at the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, for graduate studies and received a teaching assistantship, and his M.A. in 1966.  While at the University of Alabama he was befriended by the American football quarterback Joe Namath, met visiting artist Theodoros Stamos, and primarily studied painting with Melville Price, a painter who had shown in New York City with Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning and had been a member of The Club at the Cedar Tavern. During these years, Willis also participated in the Civil Rights Movement including the march from Selma to Montgomery, led by Martin Luther King Jr.\nThroughout his painting studies, Thornton Willis became highly influenced by the tenets of Abstract Expressionism embodied in The New York School of painting, including second generation painters such as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. His early work was equally informed by the more reductive paintings of Piet Mondrian and Frank Stella. These two polarities, Expressionism and Cubism were the early foundations of his paintings and continue to inform his work to this day.\nIn 1967 Thornton Willis accepted a teaching position at Wagner College in Staten Island, and moved to New York City.  He established his first studio in the Chelsea district of Manhattan.  In 1968, he had his first one-person show at the Henri Gallery in Washington, DC. In New York, Willis met fellow painters, Dan Christensen, Jules Olitski, Ken Showell as well as sculptors and installation artists Richard Serra, Alan Saret, and Gordon Matta-Clark, all working out of a process art orientation.\n\n\n=== The Slat Paintings ===\n\nFrom 1967 to 1973, Thornton Willis worked on a series of paintings now called his \u201cSlat Series\u201d involving a \u201cwet on wet\u201d process working on the floor on large wet unstretched canvas and using rollers with long extension handles to develop striped bands across the entire picture plane. In 1970, Willis was included in the exhibition entitled \u201cLyrical Abstraction\u201d  curated by Larry Aldrich, and the painting from this show, \u201cWall\u201d, 1969, acrylic on canvas, 96 inches by 114 inches, was originally exhibited at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, in Ridgefield, Connecticut.  Some of the other artists connected with Lyrical Abstraction were Victoria Barr, Jake Berthot, Dan Christensen, Ronnie Landfield, Pat Lipsky, John Torreano, Phillip Wofford and Robert Zakanitch. When in 1971, Mr. Aldrich donated this collection to The Whitney Museum of American Art, John Baur, the museum director, mounted a second Lyrical Abstraction exhibition and Willis's painting Wall became part of the Whitney Museum's permanent collection.\nThe \u201cSlat\u201d series also attracted Bykert Gallery director, Klaus Kertess, and in 1971 Willis joined the Paley and Lowe Gallery, New York City, as part of its original stable of eight artists including, Joan Snyder, Mary Heilmann, Peter Pinchbeck, Herbert Schiffrin, Fred Gudziet, Mike Bakaty, Peter Bradley, and Michael Goldberg who joined later. A \u201cSlat\u201d painting was purchased by William Paley, then Chairman of the Board of CBS, and is now in The Museum of Broadcasting, NYC.\nFrom 1971 to 1972, Willis taught painting at Louisiana State University in New Orleans.  He had a one-person show of his \u201cSlat\u201d paintings at the Simonne Stern Gallery, New Orleans in 1970,  and at The New Orleans Museum of Fine Art (then The Delgado Museum,) in 1971 which also owns a large slat painting. He continued to show with Simonne Stern through 1974.\n\n\n=== The Wedge Paintings ===\n\nAfter returning to New York City, Willis began his formalist compositions exploring Form and Field ambiguity that led to his  \u201cWedge\u201d series, 1974-1982. During this time he co-founded  \u201cReview: Artists on Art\u201d  with his wife. He showed his work at the Holly Solomon Gallery, NYC, in 1976, and in 1979 Thornton Willis won  a Guggenheim Fellowship for painting.  In the same year his work was included in the controversial exhibition \u201cAmerican Painting: The Eighties, a critical interpretation\u201d organized and curated by Barbara Rose. The exhibition opened at the Grey Art Gallery, NYC and traveled first to The Houston Museum of Fine Arts, then to the American Center, Paris, France before traveling around the world as a United States Ambassadorial show to over twenty other countries.\nIn 1979, Thornton Willis exhibited his \u201cWedge\u201d Paintings at the 55 Mercer Street Gallery where the work attracted the attention of British collectors, Robin Symes, and Charles and Doris Saatchi. He showed the \u201cWedge\u201d paintings at the Sidney Janis Gallery, NYC, in 1980 is an exhibition entitled \u201cSeven Young Americans\u201d curated by Sam Hunter which included friend and fellow artist Sean Scully.  In 1980 he had a one-person show at the Oscarsson Hood Gallery who would represent the artist until 1986. In 1980 he met the European dealer, Claes Nordenhake, and exhibited his \u201cWedge\u201d paintings in Malmo, Sweden, Gothenburg, Sweden and Helsinki, Finland and Geneva, Switzerland.\nIn 1982, Willis began a series of overlapping \u201cwedges\u2019 or \u201cdouble wedges\u2019 that allowed exploration of the vertical colored bands created where the edges met.  \u201cStriped Suit\u201d, 1982, a large double wedge canvas was featured on the cover of Arts Magazine with an essay by Steven Henry Madoff, Looking for Thornton Willis: A Treatise. With the re-opening of the Museum of Modern Art, NYC, in 1984, Willis exhibited Red Warrior in An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture. By 1984 the work had changed again as Willis sought a more complex geometry. By 1990 he had gone back to the triangle but this time in an overall grid for which he coined the term \u201cbiomorphic cubism\u201d.  The \"Triangle\" paintings would span a decade from 1990-2000.\n\n\n=== The Triangle Paintings ===\n\nIn 1991, Willis showed new work at the Andre Emmerich Gallery, NYC, in an exhibition entitled Abstract Painting: the 90\u2019s where art critic Barbara Rose chose to revisit certain painters from the 80s show. A one-person exhibition of large scale Triangle paintings and oil stick on paper followed in 1993, at the Andre Zarre Gallery  where the artist employed a tight grid overridden by gesture and a plastic color palette. In the 2001 catalogue essay for Painted in New York City: The Presence of the Past, art critic Robert C. Morgan noted Willis's Abstract Expressionist roots and the newer element of restraint.\nIn 2005, Willis teamed up with fellow painter, James Little  for a two-person show in Williamsburg, Brooklyn at the Sideshow Gallery working with owner-painter, Richard Timperio. Since 2007, Willis has shown with the Elizabeth Harris Gallery in New York City, with one-person exhibitions in 2007, 2009 and 2011. Willis has sustained a long-term relationship with art dealer Harris begun in 1980 when she co-founded Oscarsson Hood Gallery, on 57th street.\n\n\n=== The Grid Paintings ===\n\nShortly after the exhibition entitled Painting: 40 Years,\u201d a retrospective at the Sideshow Gallery in 2007, Willis returned to a rectilinear format. Combining the early \"Slat\" paintings, with exploration of form and field in his \u201cWedge\u201d series, he created a body of work he entitled  \u201cLattices\u201d where lines appear to weave forward and back. Michael Feldman documented the transition to this new work in a film, in 2008-09, Portrait of an American Painter   In 2009, Willis had a one-person show at the Elizabeth Harris Gallery, with catalog entitled The Lattice Paintings essay, by James Panero of The New Criterion. In his essay, Panero writes, \u201cEver since his wedge paintings in 1970s, Thornton has played with the density of volumes, the interaction of colors to come forward and recede, and the character of the line.\u201d \n\nTwo years later, in 2011, Willis took on form over field where form or volume appear to dominate the line. The resulting images harken to the dense mass of city buildings and maps. In an essay for this new series, Lance Esplund writes:  \u201cThose who have followed Willis\u2019s work over the years may see his current series of paintings as a departure from \u201cSlats\u201d of the 1960s, the \u201cWedges,\u201d or \u201cFins,\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, the triangular facets of recent years, and the \u201cLattice\u201d paintings from his last show, in 2009, at Elizabeth Harris. But all of these pictures have in common the allover surface plane held in tension, between figure and ground, as an interwoven field. They also share the subject of the urban landscape\u201d \nWillis continued to show with Elizabeth Harris, and in April 2013, had a one-person show of new \u201cStep\u201d paintings.  The artist included in the show, consisting predominantly of his paintings, several three dimensional painted wall pieces or assemblages.  The wall sculptures, starting with a painted canvas base, are built up with layers of found objects and painted wood. Also in April and May 2013, two large paintings by Willis were exhibited at Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison, New York, in the exhibition entitled, \u201cWorks of the Jenney Archive.\u201d\n\n\n== Selected museum and public collections ==\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York, NY\nThe Solomon R.

He is particularly known as a painter but was also active as an engraver, draftsman, book illustrator and sculptor.\n\n\n== Early life and education (1933\u20131955) ==\n\u0110uri\u0107 was born on 4 October 1933, in Cetinje, the historic capital of Montenegro, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and grew up in a middle-class family. His mother, Vjera \u0110uri\u0107 (n\u00e9e Kuja\u010di\u0107), was a biology teacher, and his father, Ranko \u0110uri\u0107, belonged to a family of entrepreneurs.\nHis childhood years were affected by world events and by personal tragedies. During World War II, Yugoslavia endured Italian and German occupation, while the local Partisans initiated a resistance that led to the emergence of Tito's Yugoslavia.\nAt the age of 11, \u0110uri\u0107 lost his mother in a country still coping with the wounds of war. He then temporarily moved to Slovenia to be put up by a maternal uncle. Although uninterested in general education, \u0110uri\u0107 developed a strong interest in art and displayed early creative skills. His family supported him to develop his talent and he started studying fine arts in the maritime town of Herceg Novi between 1947 and 1951.\nFrom 1951, \u0110uri\u0107 moved to Serbia to carry on his education in the fine arts school of Belgrade.\n\n\n== Arrival in France and first exhibitions in Paris (1956\u20131961) ==\nEncouraged by one of his teachers in Belgrade, \u0110uri\u0107 moved to Paris, France, in 1956 in the hope to work there as an artist. He survived thanks to small jobs and eventually was hired in a lithography workshop run by G\u00e9rard Patrice. In the meantime and through his professional environment, he learned French fast enough to be able to meet and interact with well-established artists such as Kalinowski and Jean Dubuffet. These meetings and his showing some of his drawings and paintings raised the curiosity of artists and art dealers alike.\nArt dealer and former resistant Daniel Cordier discovered the young \u0110uri\u0107 and offered him the unique opportunity to show his work in his art gallery in 1958: Dado's professional career was launched. Dado quickly moved from Paris to the countryside of Vexin. In 1960, he settled in a former water mill in H\u00e9rouval, Oise. This place was a haven of creation and social life until his death. During these first years in France, he developed a particularly strong friendship with Bernard R\u00e9quichot, a French artist who died in 1961.\n\n\n== Active years in France (1962\u20132010) ==\n\n\n=== Painting and drawing ===\nDado's painting and drawing activities extended across almost six decades. His paintings are mainly oil painting on linen but he also used acrylic paint and wood or even metal plates as supports.\n\nThough his creative world is highly recognizable, his style and painting technique evolved along the years. While painting, he conducted a permanent search for the essence of energy, progressively abandoning details and fine techniques in favour of more colourful and dynamic compositions.\nAn illustration of this evolution can be seen in large paintings such as Les Limbes or Le Massacre des Innocents (1958\u20131959), La Grande Ferme. Hommage \u00e0 Bernard R\u00e9quichot (1962\u20131963), Le Diptyque d'H\u00e9rouval (1975\u20131976) and L'\u00c9cole de Prescillia (2001\u20132002), in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne, Paris.\nFrom the 1990s, Dado also involved himself in several ambitious fresco projects. The four most noticeable achievements are a blockhaus in F\u00e9camp (Normandy), the embassy of the IVth International in Montjavoult (near H\u00e9rouval), a set of frescos in a former vine industry building in Domaine des Orpelli\u00e8res, H\u00e9rault and a Last Judgment fresco in the former chapel of a leper colony in the town of Gisors, Eure.\nDrawing had been present in Dado's creative means of expression since his beginnings. The artist initially used pencils and India ink. He also resorted to mixed techniques using gouache, pencils and India ink, realising impressive collages.\n\n\n=== Engravings ===\nDado realised his first engraving (a dry-point) in 1966 in Georges Visat's workshop. He was also interested in lithography. Dado started exploring the techniques of engraving (copper-plate engraving and etching) with the help of Alain Controu in Normandy in 1967. Their collaboration continued until the 1990s.\n\nHe continued a substantial work in this domain, including several years in the 1980s in the Lacouri\u00e8re-Fr\u00e9laut Engraving workshop in Paris and in an engraving workshop close to H\u00e9rouval (collaboration with engraver Biel Genty). A part of his engraving work features in the collections of the D\u00e9partement des estampes et de la Photographie of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (in English: The Department of Stamps and Photography of the National Library of France).\n\n\n=== Sculpture and ceramics ===\nSculpture played a particular role in Dado's creation, as premises can be seen as early as in 1962 but most works were made in the 2000s until his death. In 1962, Dado's first achievement in sculpture was a pole using cattle bones collected in a knacker's yard.\nIn 1968, Dado exhibited a Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant car in the CNAC, Paris. The car wreck appearance was totally changed by a profusion of bones. Dado returned mainly to sculpture in his last decade of creation. In 2009 and under the auspices of Montenegro, a set of 27 sculptures Les El\u00e9gies Zorzi was exhibited in the Zorzi palace during the Venice Art Biennale.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s to 2000, the artist also explored the use of ceramics as a medium for his creation. A most noticeable achievement in this field is a set of ceramics tiles in tribute to French writer Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky.\n\n\n=== Collection books ===\nA fervent books collector and reader, Dado found opportunities to work with writers, poets or essayists, who most of time were friends of him. Having met French writer Georges Perec, Dado illustrated Alphabets, a book dedicated to word play (1976). After Georges Perec's death, Dado would work on a second version of the book, mainly consisting in enriched illustrations of the first version.\nIn 1985, he worked on a series of 9 dry-point engravings to illustrate Le Terrier by Franz Kafka, at the Lacouri\u00e8re-Fr\u00e9laut workshop.\nIn 1989, he illustrated Le Bonheur dans le crime by Barbey d'Aurevilly published with the Imprimerie nationale. Two important collaborators of Dado were the writers Claude Louis-Combet and Pierre Bettencourt. Bettencourt and Dado produced illustrated versions of Les plus belles Phrases de la Langue fran\u00e7aise (1990), Voyage sur la Plan\u00e8te innomm\u00e9e (1990) and Les N\u00e9griers jaunes (1995).\nTheir collaboration started in 1984 when Pierre Bettencourt wrote a text for an exhibition catalogue of paintings inspired by Buffon's work. As a son of the teacher of biology, Dado was fascinated by natural science.\nClaude Louis-Combet, a long-time friend, and Dado produced several books. Some of those texts were specifically written in order to be published with illustrations of Dado. Including those is Les Oiseaux d'Ir\u00e8ne (2007), a personal tribute of both artists to writer Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky and Dadomorphes & Dadopathes, with 5 engravings by Dado, published with Deyrolles in 1992.\nIn the 2000s, Dado worked with Jean-Marc Rouillan with the publishing of Les Visc\u00e8res polychromes de la Peste brune, 2009.\n\n\n=== Production design ===\nIn 1993, Dado took part to the production design of Handel's Tamerlano for the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, direction Jean-Louis Martinoty, conductor Roy Goodman.\nIn 1996, Dado renewed his experience in production design with the world premiere of Llanto por Ignacio Sanchez of Stavros Xarchakos, based on a poem by Lorca, direction Pierre Jourdan, in the Th\u00e9atre Imp\u00e9rial de Compi\u00e8gne, France.\n\n\n=== Digital works ===\nDado realizes his first digital collages from 1996 in the printing workshop of his sister, Marija. Some of these works will be reproduced later in the Swiss art review Trou.\nSeveral digital collages based on photographs by Domingo \u0110uri\u0107 were shown at the Venice Biennale in 2009. From 2007, Dado devoted himself to the creation of a website with the help of his son-in-law, a virtual antimuseum, The Dado Syndrome.\nIn 2010, as a virtual museum, for its English version, the website was granted by ICOM permission to use the top-level domain .museum which was limited exclusively to museums until 2018, when AFNIC was designated by ICOM as the world registry operator for .museum and relaxed eligibility rules. The site is trilingual: French/Montenegrin/English.\n\n\n== Dado in public collections ==\nCentre Pompidou, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne, Paris, France\nMus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, Toulouse, France\nMus\u00e9e r\u00e9gional d'Art contemporain de la R\u00e9gion Languedoc-Roussillon\nMOMA, New York, United States\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDado met his wife Hessie, a Cuban artist, during a trip to New York in 1962. Originally native of the Caribbean, she moved to H\u00e9rouval and married him. They raised five children together.\nThough staying most of the time in his secluded home, Dado occasionally left his place to feed his interest in the outer world. In 1984, he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\nBesides travelling several times to New York, he had a unique experience joining a team of medical researchers in Central Africa in 1974, spending a month with the Pygmies of the Central African Republic rainforest. Other noticeable experiences were a discovery of India in 1992 and a trip to Guatemala in 1997.\nInfluence of these trips is reflected in paintings such as the Boukoko triptyque (1974) and Tikal (1998).\nDado died at the age of 77 in Pontoise near Paris on November 27, 2010.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJean-Louis Andral, Donations Daniel Cordier.

His transmedia contextual work involves painting, found objects, new media, drawings, sculpture, photography, performance and video. \nG\u00fclan studied Media at The New School, New York. His art has appeared at Pera Museum, Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro, ZKM Karlsruhe, Triennale di Milano, Biennial of Tehran and Pompidou Center Paris. Gulan has had solo shows at Gallery Artist in Berlin, Istanbul; State Painting and Sculpture Museums in Ankara, Izmir; Foto Gallery Lang, Zagreb and Artda Gallery, Seoul among other places.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\nG\u00fclan uses text, codes and even his own DNA in his art. He is a new media artist. In a video piece called Tele-rugby, he filmed a female swim team playing rugby underwater with a TV monitor.\nHis experimental works include net-art, web art, AI generated images, Robot Games, SCIgen papers and online videos. Genco uses boron in his sculptures.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe Android Statue was exhibited in Antalya Archeology Museum 12\u201320 March 2014. In the exhibition, the sketches of his kinetic marble statue series, called \"Robotic Statues\" were also presented. G\u00fclan has been working on robots in the labs of different universities since the middle of 1990s. He uses hardware and software of robots in many art projects. For example, the artwork titled Robots, Football and War (RFW) of G\u00fclan that consists of physical robots, was part of a computer game \"Balkan Wars\" that won a prize from European Media Art Festival, Osnabr\u00fcck in 1995. His play generated by artificial intelligence (AI) robots was used in the project YEN! (New), presented in Pera Museum, for 16th Istanbul Theatre Festival.\n\nG\u00fclan's The Great Conjugation, was exhibited at his alma mater, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University's Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences building, Washburn Hall through May and June 2014. G\u00fclan's The Great Conjugation used approximately 1000 ties for this installation. All of the connected ties created a route tens of meters long and the line flowed through the all five floors of the building. The ties connected the twin towers of the building from the inside which was built in 1906. During the exhibition, G\u00fclan invited the viewers to bring their ties and add them to the installation. The ties used in the project have different colors, designs, and brands. They were gathered from hundreds of domestic and abroad donators.  The same ties were exhibited in The Thessaloniki State Museum of Contemporary Art and Ankara Contemporary Art Center in 2013. At the first display in Istanbul, they were attached with a crane to a skyscraper and raised 160 meters from the ground. Genco G\u00fclan was selected as a finalist at Sovereign Art Foundation European Art Prize in 2011. He opened his first exhibition at White Saloon inside the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences building where he had also taken many courses while he was studying at the Department of Political Science and International Relations between 1987 and 1991.\n\nA show named Swimming Rocks was in an exhibit of the same name on 27 June 2014 at the Art Gallery of K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131 Ard\u0131\u00e7 Ku\u015fu, Gallery Metazori in \u00c7e\u015fme, Ala\u00e7at\u0131 where G\u00fclan spent most of his childhood. The \"swimming rocks\" in question are pumice rocks which can float on the sea and which are found in the Aegean Sea, especially in \u00c7e\u015fme and Ala\u00e7at\u0131. G\u00fclan made Swimming Rocks from these and other stones. The artworks of his mother, Tezer G\u00fclan, and his grandmother, Saime \u0130zmiro\u011flu were also exhibited in the show. Genco G\u00fclan also had a series called New Landscape in this exhibition. This series, a conceptual/electronic interpretation of landscapes as barcodes, examined how landscapes change over time. G\u00fclan also exhibited his series Digital Ghost in the show, painting images from his laptop on large canvases.\n\n\n== Museum ==\nAs an art project in 1997, Genco G\u00fclan established the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum. \n\n\"At first the Istanbul Contemporary Art Museum developed as an art series in the manner of Duchamp and Broodthaers until the end of the 1990s. Later it evolved when it was transferred to the Internet. It turned into a new age institution that organized exhibitions, workshops and provided logistic support on cyber space.\"\n\nFor almost a decade, the museum ran a residency program called \"I live in a Museum\" and hosted artists from the U.S., the Netherlands, Spain, and China at its Galata location.\nG\u00fclan's monograph; \"Conceptual Colors\" edited by Marcus Graf, is co-published by Revolver Publishing in Berlin in collaboration with Artist Istanbul. His books are available at libraries such as the German National Library, SALT Istanbul, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Thomas J. Watson Library and the Haas Family Arts Library at Yale University. G\u00fclan founded the Web Biennial at the turn of the century, served on the Board of Balkan Biennial in Thessaloniki, International Programming Committee of ISEA Singapore in 2008 and was a guest editor for Second Nature: International Journal of Creative Media. He was in the jury for Turgut Pura Art Prize in Izmir and teaches at Mimar Sinan Academy and Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University.\n\n\n== Selected images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMarcus Graf.

Salle was born in Norman, Oklahoma, and lives and works in East Hampton, New York. He earned a BFA and MFA from the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California, where he studied with John Baldessari. Salle\u2019s work first came to public attention in New York City in the early 1980s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDavid Salle was born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents on September 28, 1952, in Norman, Oklahoma, but grew up in Wichita, Kansas. He developed an interest in art at a very young age, spending his childhood and teenage years in art classes provided by a local art organization. At an early age he began taking life-drawing classes at the Wichita Art Association. During high school, he attended outside art classes three days a week.\nAfter graduating from high school, Salle attended the California Institute of the Arts. There he trained and studied under John Baldessari, whom he credits for showing him a path to his artistry. Salle earned his BFA in three years, then received his MFA in two.\nAfter graduating, Salle relocated to New York City, where he worked for Vito Acconci. During this time, he established a working partnership with Mary Boone. Around the same time, Salle was hired by the American Ballet Theatre to design set and costumes for dancer and choreographer Karole Armitage.\nIn 1995, Salle made his Hollywood directorial debut with Search and Destroy, starring Christopher Walken and Griffin Dunne and produced by Martin Scorsese. The film met with very negative reactions.\n\n\n== Art ==\nSalle's paintings and prints consist of what appear to be randomly juxtaposed and multilayered images, or images placed on top of one other with deliberately illogical techniques, in which he combines original and appropriated imagery. Imagery he uses includes items from popular culture, such as Donald Duck, and pieces from art history, such as parts from a Caravaggio painting. \nSalle has worked with different media and processes. Many of his works consist of juxtaposed images, where he takes abstraction and the human figure. He manipulates images by combining a variety of different styles, recognizable imagery, and textures. Exhibitions of his work have taken place at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Castello di Rivoli (Torino, Italy), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and the Kestnergesellschaft Museum in Hannover, Germany. Salle's work was also featured in The Pictures Generation, an exhibition curated by Douglas Eklund at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His work was shown among a number of other contemporary artists including Richard Prince, Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, Nancy Dwyer, Robert Longo, Thomas Lawson, Charles Clough, and Michael Zwack.\nSalle's process typically starts with photographs he takes for reference, such as hired models. This was both groundbreaking and controversial at the time, primarily because the combination of these two art forms was not common practice. During this period, painters and photographers were often debating which form had more merit, or whether they had merit at all. Though his collection of photographs is considered art itself, Salle has said he would paint his final images because it took images from the real world and placed them in the world and context of painting. \nAccording to Salle, his intention was to eliminate any narrative from his work, though one might attempt to decipher a story from the imagery. His decision-making process begins with one image he is attracted to, to which he continues to add pieces from specific images he acquired until the painting feels complete. Though Salle's works do not contain a narrative, they do not lack meaning or relation. He has said that his choices of image are far from random, and that the pieces he chooses are cross-referenced with one another in complex ways. He believes this to be his form of originality in pieces that he appropriates.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21, Salle has painted a series of works called Tree of Life which reference Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, and The New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno (1904-1968). The canvases alternate between a black and white and polychrome palette.\nSalle has also done set and costume design and directed films. In 1986 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Theater Design, and directed the feature film Search and Destroy. He is a longtime collaborator with the choreographer Karole Armitage, designing sets and costumes for her ballets.\nSalle has explored the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in his art. In 2023, he collaborated with computer scientists to create a program capable of generating images reflective of his style. The program was trained on a dataset composed of Salle\u2019s paintings and refined based on his input. Salle has described the generative AI as useful because he can conceptualize variations of artwork when brainstorming ideas for new paintings. When asked about the potential of AI superseding him someday, Salle acknowledged the large role that AI may play in the future of art.\n\n\n== Written works ==\nSalle is also a prolific writer on art. His essays and reviews have appeared in Artforum, Art in America, Modern Painters, The Paris Review, Interview, and numerous exhibition catalogs and anthologies. He was a regular contributor to Town & Country magazine. His collection of critical essays, How to See, was published by W. W. Norton in 2016. Salle worked closely with fellow contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein, and John Baldessari in creating this collection. According to Dwight Garner:\n\nMr. Salle\u2019s mission in How to See is to seize art back from the sort of critics who treat each painting \u201cas a position paper, with the artist cast as a kind of philosopher manqu\u00e9.\u201d Mr. Salle is more interested in talking about nuts and bolts, about what makes contemporary paintings tick.\nSalle's writing is much like his artistic style, witty and intriguing. He believes the jargon associated with art history can and should be simplified so that those who are interested but lack fine art schooling can still learn about and appreciate art.\n\n\n== Criticism and praise ==\nThough Salle insists that his works are not a random assortment of images layered onto one another, critics were difficult to convince. Some common critiques are that his paintings are incoherent and the images he chooses arbitrary and unrelated to one another. The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto wrote that Salle's paintings convey a \"sense of purposiveness with no specific purpose.\" Critic Robert Storr was fascinated by the work's \"graphic double-exposure\" and \"kaleidoscopic effect,\" as well as its infinite meanings and interpretations.\nAnother point of contention was Salle's use of pornographic images of women, which some critics found a form of voyeurism or downright provocation, particularly to the feminist movement. Mira Schor, a feminist artist and writer, wrote that his portrayals of women seem \"to be a continuation of a male conversation which is centuries old, to which women are irrelevant except as depersonalized projections of man's fears and fantasies.\" Salle, as well as many critics, says that the images, though sexually explicit, are not \"particularly erotic\" because they are faded and blurred, distancing them from reality.\n\n\n== Public collections ==\nSalle's work is in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website", "Anri Sala (born 1974) is an Albanian contemporary artist whose primary medium is video.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nSala studied art at the Albanian Academy of Arts from 1992 to 1996.

She achieved prominence through her early 1990s photographic project The Kitchen Table Series. Her photographs, films and videos focus on serious issues facing African Americans today, including racism, sexism, politics and personal identity.\nShe once said, \"Let me say that my primary concern in art, as in politics, is with the status and place of Afro-Americans in the country.\" More recently, however, she expressed the view that \"Black experience is not really the main point; rather, complex, dimensional, human experience and social inclusion ... is the real point.\" She continues to produce art that provides social commentary on the experiences of people of color, especially black women, in America.\nHer talents have been recognized by Harvard University and Wellesley College, with fellowships, artist-in-residence and visiting professor positions. She taught photography at Hampshire College in the late 1980s and shot the \"Kitchen Table\" series in her home in Western Massachusetts. Weems is one of six artist-curators who made selections for Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2019/20. She is artist in residence at Syracuse University.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and education (1953\u20131980) ===\nWeems was born in Portland, Oregon in 1953, the second of seven children to Carrie Polk and Myrlie Weems. She began participating in dance and street theater in 1965. At the age of 16, she gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Faith C. Weems.\nLater that year (1970), she moved out of her parents' home and soon relocated to San Francisco to study modern dance with Anna Halprin at a workshop Halprin had started with several other dancers, as well as the artists John Cage and Robert Morris. Weems recalled, \"I started dancing with the famous and extraordinary Anna Halprin. I was in Anna's company for I suppose, maybe a year or two\u2026experimenting with very deep parts of dance and ideas about dance. Anna was really interested in ideas about peace and using dance as a way to bridge different cultures together as a vehicle for multicultural expression...I wasn't really so interested in dance, I just knew how to dance really well. I had a really, I think, deep sense of my body from a very early age.\"  Thirty years later in 2008, Weems circled back to dance in her project Constructing History: A Requiem to Mark the Moment, at the Savannah College of Art and Design in Atlanta,  noting \"I'm just beginning this project of looking at blues and flamenco, and ideas about dance and movement.\"\nShe decided to continue her arts schooling and attended the California Institute of the Arts, in the Los Angeles metro, graduating at the age of 28 with a BFA degree. She received her MFA from the University of California, San Diego. Weems also participated in the folklore graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley.\nWhile in her early twenties, Weems was politically active in the labor movement as a union organizer. Her first camera, which she received as a birthday gift, was used for this work before being used for artistic purposes. She was inspired to pursue photography after coming across The Black Photographers Annual, a book of images by African-American photographers including Shawn Walker, Beuford Smith, Anthony Barboza, Ming Smith, Adger Cowans and Roy DeCarava. This led her to New York City and the Studio Museum in Harlem, where she began to meet other artists and photographers such as Coreen Simpson and Frank Stewart, and they began to form a community. In 1976, Weems took a photography class at the Museum taught by Dawoud Bey and earned money as an assistant to Anthony Barboza. She returned to San Francisco, but lived bi-coastally and was invited by Janet Henry to teach at the Studio Museum and a community of photographers in New York.\n\n\n=== 1980\u20132000 ===\n\nIn 1983, Weems completed her first collection of photographs, text and spoken word, called Family Pictures and Stories. The images told the story of her family, and she has said that in this project she was trying to explore the movement of black families out of the South and into the North, using her family as a model for the larger theme. Her next series, called Ain't Jokin', was completed in 1988.  It focused on racial jokes and internalized racism. Another series called American Icons, completed in 1989, also focused on racism. Weems has said that throughout the 1980s she was turning away from the documentary photography genre, instead \"creating representations that appeared to be documents but were in fact staged\" and also \"incorporating text, using multiples images, diptychs and triptychs, and constructing narratives.\" Sexism was the next focal point for her. It was the topic of one of her most well known collections called The Kitchen Table series which was completed over a two-year period (1989 to 1990), and has Weems cast as the central character in the photographs. About Kitchen Table and Family Pictures and Stories, Weems has said: \"I use my own constructed image as a vehicle for questioning ideas about the role of tradition, the nature of family, monogamy, polygamy, relationships between men and women, between women and their children, and between women and other women\u2014underscoring the critical problems and the possible resolves.\" She has expressed disbelief and concern about the exclusion of images of the black community, particularly black women, from the popular media, and she aims to represent these excluded subjects and speak to their experience through her work. These photographs created space for other black female artists to further create art. Weems has also reflected on the themes and inspirations of her work as a whole, saying,... from the very beginning, I've been interested in the idea of power and the consequences of power; relationships are made and articulated through power. Another thing that's interesting about the early work is that even though I've been engaged in the idea of autobiography, other ideas have been more important: the role of narrative, the social levels of humor, the deconstruction of documentary, the construction of history, the use of text, storytelling, performance, and the role of memory have all been more central to my thinking than autobiography.\n\n\n=== 2000\u2013present ===\n\nWeems remains active in the art world with her recent photographic project such as Louisiana Project (2003), Roaming (2006), Museums (2006), Constructing History (2008), African Jewels (2009), Mandingo (2010), Slow Fade to Black (2010), Equivalents (2012), Blue Notes (2014\u20132015) and the expanded bodies of works including installation, mixed media, and video project. Her recent project, Grace Notes: Reflections for Now, is a multimedia performance that explores \"the role of grace in the pursuit of democracy.\" Her recent work Slow Fade to Black (2010)  explores the lost image and memory of African-American female entertainers, including singers, dancers, and actresses, in the twentieth century by playing on the idea of cinematic fade. The freeze frame of a camera lens makes it impossible for us to tell whether or not those images are fading in or fading outs. The series of photos features a number of prominent female African-American artists from the last century, such as Marian Anderson and Billie Holiday, who faded out of our collective memory. The blurred images of the artists serves as metaphor of the on-going struggle for African-American entertainers to remain visible and relevant. In 2023 Weems became the first black woman to win the Hasselblad Award.\n\n\n== Commissions ==\nFor the season 2020/2021 at the Vienna State Opera Weems designed the large-scale picture (176 sqm) Queen B (Mary J. Blige) as part of the exhibition series Safety Curtain, conceived by museum in progress. \nIn 2024, Bottega Veneta commissioned Weems to create an ad campaign that starred the rapper A$AP Rocky and his daughters.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nWeems has been represented by Jack Shainman Gallery since 2008.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nCarrie Mae Weems: The Museum of Modern Art (N.Y.), 1995.\nCarrie Mae Weems : Image Maker, 1995.\nCarrie Mae Weems : Recent Work, 1992\u20131998, 1998.\nCarrie Mae Weems: In Louisiana Project, 2004.\nCarrie Mae Weems: Constructing History, 2008.\nCarrie Mae Weems : Social Studies, 2010.\nCarrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Photography and Video, 2012.\nCarrie Mae Weems, Yale University Press, 2012.

Curated by Katie Delmez, the exhibition ran until January 13, 2013, and later traveled to Portland Art Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Cantor Center for Visual Arts. The 30-year retrospective exhibition opened in January 2014 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. This was the first time an \"African-American woman [was] ever given a solo exhibition\" at the Guggenheim. Weems' work returned to the Frist in October 2013 as a part of the center's 30 Americans gallery, alongside black artists ranging from Jean-Michel Basquiat to Kehinde Wiley. In 2021, Weems presented The Shape of Things exhibit at the Park Avenue Armory.\nHer first solo exhibition in Germany, shown in 2022 at the W\u00fcrttembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart, is titled The Evidence of Things Not Seen.\nIn 2023, the Barbican Centre in London hosted Weems' first major UK exhibition, titled Reflections for Now and featuring photography and video installations from over three decades. Her work was also featured in the group show Spirit in the Land organized and exhibited with accompanying publication at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in 2023, which later traveled to the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami in 2024. Carrie Mae Weems presented about her career trajectory at the Scholl Lecture Series, an artist's talk series, presented by PAMM, in February of 2024.  \n\n\n== Notable works in public collections ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPhotographer of the Year by the Friends of Photography\n2006: Rome Prize Fellowship\n2007: Anonymous Was A Woman Award\n2013: Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Lifetime Achievement Award\n2013: MacArthur Fellow, \"Genius\" Award\n2014: BET Visual Arts Award\n2014: Lucie Award\n2015: ICP Spotlights Award from the International Center of Photography.\n2015: Ford Foundation Art of Change Fellow\n2015: W.

Many of her works have made use of professional models, sometimes in large numbers and sometimes naked or nearly so, to stage tableaux vivants. She works in the United States, and is based in Los Angeles as of 2009. Her early work was focused on gender and appeared to be autobiographical; her later work is focused on race. Starting in 2008 she began working with Kanye West on collaborations and commercial projects.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nVanessa Beecroft was born April 25, 1969, in Genoa, Italy and raised in Santa Margherita Ligure and Malcesine near Lake Garda. Both of her parents were teachers; she was born to an Italian mother, Maria Luisa and a British father, Andrew Beecroft. After she was born, her family briefly moved to Holland Park, west London.\nHer parents divorced when she was three years old and she did not see her father or her younger brother again until she was 15 years old. Her mother raised Beecroft alone in a village in Italy in a strict vegan household with no cars, no television, and no phone. In childhood, she was hospitalized for overeating specific foods she thought would cleanse her system, and she struggled with an eating disorder.\nFrom 1988 to 1993 she attended Brera Academy in Milan, Italy. Her first art exhibition VB01 (1993) was in a gallery in Milan and featured a performance with other female students from Brera Academy wearing Beecroft's clothing, and sharing Beecroft's \"Book of Food\", a diary documenting her food consumption from 1985 and 1993. The \"Book of Food\" documented Beecroft's bulimic eating habits and was referenced again in her later work, but it was separate from the performances.\nShe moved to the United States in 1996, at the invitation of art dealer Jeffrey Deitch, settling in New York City.\n\n\n== Art ==\nSome common themes in the work include self discipline (of the models), voyeurism, and power relationships. Beecroft's artwork is often performance or installation-based with live human figures, but she also documents the performances with photography and video; this work is in many public museum and art collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Van Abbemuseum, amongst others.\n\n\n=== VB performances (1993\u2013present) ===\nMany of the VB performances were documented in the Dave Hickey book VB 08-36: Vanessa Beecroft Performances (2000), and in Emily L. Newman's book Female Body Image in Contemporary Art: Dieting, Eating Disorders, Self-Harm, and Fatness (2018).\nThe performances were titled sequentially. Strict rules were imposed on the models' behavior during the performances; they were instructed not to engage with the audience. Models were uniformed, nude, or barely clothed and were required to stand for hours, often in tall high heels without movement or eye contact. Beecroft always used tall, thin, young models who she referred to as \"girls\", regardless of their age. In later work, Beecroft would use designer accessories or shoes as props for the models.\n\nVB02, VB03, VB04, and VB08 took place in 1994 and featured live girl models all dressed in bright red wigs (an exaggerated representation of Beecroft's own hair color) and white underwear. VB08 (1994) performance took place at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, New York, using live female models, pantyhose, and bright red wigs.\nVB25 (1996) performance took place at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with seven identical-looking young women wearing fake eyelashes and red nail polish, each dressed in a polo-neck pullover, white underwear, tights, and high heels.\nVB35: Show (1998) took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; twenty women stood in the museum for two hours in a circular arrangement in order to mirror the architecture. Fifteen of the women wore rhinestone-decorated bikinis designed by Tom Ford, and five of the women were nude. This was a larger event than some of her prior work and made international news. Casting was done by Jennifer Starr, and the production was done by Yvonne Force Villareal, and Doreen Remen.\nVB45 (2004) took place at Terminal 5 of the John F. Kennedy Airport with 36 young women standing in formation in the sunken waiting area, wearing only Afro wigs, black body paint, and silver shackles on their ankles.\nVB51 (2002) was her first filmed performance, it took place in Schloss Vinsebeck, Stenheim, Germany. It featured older models in their 60s, including Beecroft's mother, mother-in-law, stepsister, and the actresses Irm Hermann and Hanna Schygulla (both actresses from films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Beecroft's favorite director).\nVB53 (2004) at the Tepidarium in Giardino dell\u2019Orticultura, Florence, Italy, women were staged in a mound of dirt, as if they were plants.\nVB55 (2005) featured one hundred women standing still in Berlin's Neue Nationalgalerie for three hours, each woman oiled from the waist up and wearing nothing but a pair of pantyhose.\nVB61, Still Death! Darfur Still Deaf? (2007), one of Beecroft's most politically-engaged performances, was presented the 52nd Venice Biennale. It involved \"approximately 30 Sudanese women with their skin painted, lying face-down on a white canvas on the ground, simulating dead bodies piled on top of one another\", representing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.\nVB65 (March 2009) performance at Padiglione d'Arte Contemporanea (PAC) in Milan, Italy, featured a \"Last Supper\" of twenty African immigrant men, dressed formally in suits (some without shoes), drinking water, eating chicken and brown bread without cutlery.\nVB66 (2010) took place at Mercato Ittico di Napoli (the fish market), Naples, Italy with fifty living models, staged on a platform amongst a group of cast body sculptures and body parts, all painted black. It highlighted the relationships among body, sculpture, and an iconographical reference to the nearby ruins of Pompeii.\nVB67 (2010) performance took place at Studio Nicoli in Carrara, Italy, and again a similar reenactment in a year later, VB70: Marmi (2011) at Lia Rumma gallery in Milan. The models were staged near marble sculpture statues and the stone was in various states including polished, rough, and in blocks and slabs.\n\n\n=== Other work ===\nIn October 2005, Beecroft staged a three-hour performance on the occasion of the opening of the Louis Vuitton store, \"Espace Louis Vuitton\" on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. For the same event, Beecroft placed models both black and white on the shelves next to Louis Vuitton bags in a \"human alphabet\". In 2007 the Louis Vuitton company apologized to Dutch graphic designer Anthon Beeke for mimicking his \"Naked Ladies Alphabet\" design without his consent.\nIn 2018, Beecroft and Kim Kardashian collaborated on a series of nude photos of Kardashian that were displayed on social media for the release of Kardashian's perfume, which had a \"Kardashian body-shaped bottle\".\n\n\n== Collaborations with Kanye West ==\nSince 2008, Beecroft has been collaborating on work with artist Kanye West. They began working together with a listening party at Ace Gallery, Los Angeles for West's music albums 808s and Heartbreaks. In 2010, Beecroft was named creative lead for the Runaway music video. On the Kanye West music tour, the Yeezus Tour (October 2013 \u2013 September 2014), Beecroft designed the sets and choreography. Beecroft worked on West's Spike Jonze directed music video for the 2014 song \u201cOnly One\u201d. In 2014, Beecroft assembled and built the wedding ceremony of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West .\nIn February 2015, West embarked on a fashion design career with Yeezy Season 1, under the Adidas label and Beecroft directed the performance presentation. Beecroft went on to work on Yeezy Season 2 (September 2015), Yeezy Season 3 (February 2016), and Yeezy Season 4 (September 2016).\nBeecroft alleged she was a full-time employee for West until 2016, when her role changed and she became a part-time contractor.\nIn 2019, she collaborated with West on two opera-based performances, Nebuchadnezzar and Mary.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nHer performance work about gender was often critiqued for being a \"post-feminist statement about fashion or pandering to a corrupted way of seeing\". Photographer Collier Schorr noted, \"Beecroft is interested in the aesthetics of how women look when they are looked at, and her body-conscious projects encourage alienation between model, artist, and audience.\" Beecroft's work with live female nude models in performances often uses a specific type of model, one with an Westernized \"idealization\" of the female body, all of the models appearing uniformly thin, tall, and young. These choices have been criticized as harmful, distorted, and conforming to gender stereotypes.\nBeecroft has been quoted in an interview in 2016, \u201cI have divided my personality. There is Vanessa Beecroft as a European white female, and then there is Vanessa Beecroft as Kanye, an African-American male.\u201d Her later work deals with race, and she has made a series of racially insensitive remarks in interviews.\nBeecroft\u2019s failed attempt to adopt Sudanese twins was the topic of the documentary The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins (2008) by Pietra Brettkelly, which was included in the Sundance Film Festival's World Cinema Documentary Competition. The film presents Beecroft as a \"hypocritically self-aware, colossally colonial pomo narcissist\" and chronicles her \"damaging quotes and appalling behavior\" as she attempts to adopt the orphans for use in an art exhibit.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVanessa Beecroft was previously married to marketer Greg Durkin. They lived in Cold Spring Harbor, New York together for many years. The marriage ended in divorce. Durkin and Beecroft had two sons together (born in 2001 and 2004). Later, she married to photographer Federico Spadoni. Beecroft and Spadoni have one daughter and one son together (born 2009 and 2012).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Biography ===\nKampwerth, Karin; Thomas, Kellein; Beecroft, Vanessa (2004).

He was a member of the art movement Neue Wilde.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nImmendorff was born in Bleckede, Lower Saxony, near L\u00fcneburg on the west bank of the Elbe. When he was 11 years old, his father left the family. This traumatic experience has been used to explain Immendorff's later feelings of inadequacy and emotional remoteness. \nHe attended the boarding School \u2190Ernst-Kalkuhl Gymnasium as a student. At the age of sixteen he had his first exhibition in a jazz cellar in Bonn.\nBeginning in 1963, Immendorff studied at the Art Academy in D\u00fcsseldorf (Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf). Initially he studied for three terms with the theater designer Teo Otto. After Otto threw him out of his class for refusing to let one of his paintings serve as stage-set decoration, Immendorff was accepted as a student by Joseph Beuys. The academy expelled him because of some of his (left-wing) political activities and neo-dadaist actions.\nFrom 1969 to 1980, Immendorff worked as an art teacher at a public school, and then as a free artist, holding visiting professorships all over Europe. \nIn 1989, he became professor at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt am Main and in 1996 he became professor at the Art Academy in D\u00fcsseldorf\u2014the same school that had dismissed him decades earlier as a student. His master students at the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy included Oda Jaune and Renata Jaworska.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nJ\u00f6rg Immendorff often worked in \"grand cycles of paintings\" that often lasted years at a time and were political in nature. Notable cycles include LIDL, Maoist Paintings, Caf\u00e8 Deutschland , and The Rake's Progress.\n\n\n=== LIDL ===\nThe first body of work that Immendorff gave a name to were his LIDL paintings, sculptures, performances, and documents, that he executed during 1968\u20131970. The name, \"LIDL\" was inspired by the sound of a child's rattle makes and much of his work from this period included the iconography of new beginnings and innocence. LIDL is comparable to Dadaist but unlike the Dadist movement it never became an established group but rather consisted of a variety of artists (including James Lee Byars, Marcel Broodthaers, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys) participating in actions and activities. The art-historian Pamela Kort wrote this of Immendorf's LIDL works:\n\n\"LIDL ridiculed elitist art traditions, the cult of creative 'genius', and the precious aesthetic object. The artist countered these hierarchies by assembling a body of pretentious iconographic motifs drawn from the make-believe world of the child \u2013 turtles, dogs, goldfish, playhouses, and polar bears \u2013 which he transformed into the 'working material' of what he hoped would be a new functional art form.\"  \n\nIn January 1968 he appeared in front of the West German Parliament in Bonn with a wood block labeled \u201cLidl\u201d tethered to his ankle and painted in the colors of the German flag; he was subsequently arrested for defaming the flag.\n\n\n=== Caf\u00e9  Deutschland ===\nBest known is his Caf\u00e9 Deutschland series of sixteen large paintings (1977\u20131984) that were inspired by  Renato Guttuso\u2019s  Caff\u00e8 Greco; in these crowded colorful pictures, Immendorff had disco-goers symbolize the conflict between East and West Germany. Since the 1970s, he worked closely with the painter A. R. Penck from Dresden (in East Germany). Immendorff was a member of the German art movement Neue Wilde.\n\n\n=== Other activities ===\nImmendorff created several stage designs, including two for the Salzburg Festival. He designed sets for the operas Elektra and The Rake's Progress. The latter also inspired a series of paintings in which he cast himself as the rake.\nIn 1984, Immendorff opened the bar La Paloma near the Reeperbahn in Hamburg St. Pauli and created a large bronze sculpture of Hans Albers there. He also contributed to the design of Andr\u00e9 Heller's avant-garde amusement park \"Luna, Luna\" in 1987. For three months, from 1987 until 1988, Immendorff was the foreign artist in residence at the Auckland Art Gallery in New Zealand, attracting a lot of attention in the local scene there.\nImmendorff created various sculptures; one spectacular example is a 25 m tall iron sculpture in the form of an oak tree trunk, erected in Riesa in 1999.\nIn 2006, Immendorff selected 25 of his paintings for an illustrated Bible. In the foreword he described his belief in God.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nA major 2019 survey began at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and later traveled later to the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid and the Fondazione Querini Stampalia in Venice, curated by Francesco Bonami.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2000, Immendorff married his former student Oda Jaune. The two had a daughter, Ida, who was born on 13 August 2001.\nIn August 2003, Immendorff was caught in the luxury suite of the Steigenberger Parkhotel in D\u00fcsseldorf with seven prostitutes (and four more on their way) and some cocaine. More cocaine was found in his studio; all in all, the found substances contained 6.6 grams of pure cocaine, above the legal threshold for personal use. In interviews, Immendorff attempted to explain his actions with his terminal illness and as an expression of his \"orientalism\" that provided inspiration for his work. He also complained about prostitutes \"who don't understand that a good whore does not divulge anything about her clients.\" He cooperated with the prosecution, admitted to having taken cocaine since the early 1990s and supplied the name of his dealer. At the trial in July 2004, he admitted to having organized 27 similar orgies between February 2001 and August 2003. He was sentenced to 11 months on probation and was fined \u20ac150,000. The mild sentence was justified with Immendorff's illness and his extensive confession. He had been suspended from his position at the university but was reinstated after the verdict.\nIn March 2004, a woman attempted to blackmail Immendorff, threatening to divulge further details of the orgies. Immendorff notified the police and she was arrested. Her trial started in September 2004.\n\n\n=== Disease and death ===\nImmendorff was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) in 1998. When he could not paint with his left hand any more, he switched to the right. In 2004 he funded a stipend to research the disease.\nIn November 2005, he was treated by emergency physicians and was admitted to a hospital, where a tracheotomy had to be performed to help him breathe. As of 2006, he used a wheelchair full-time and did not paint anymore; instead he directed his assistants to paint following his instructions.\nOn 27 May 2007, at the age of 61, he succumbed to the disease. He died in D\u00fcsseldorf and his ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean Sea. In his will, he left his entire estate, estimated at \u20ac15\u201318 million, to his wife. A 12-year-old son from a former relationship who never knew his father went to court over the size of his legitime.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 1997, Immendorf won the world's best endowed art prize at the time, the MARCO prize of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico. In the following year he received the merit medal (Bundesverdienstkreuz) of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nImmendorf was considered a friend and the favorite painter of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who chose him to paint his official portrait for the Federal Chancellery. The portrait, which was completed by Immendorff's assistants, was revealed to the public in January 2007; the massive work has ironic character, showing the former Chancellor in stern heroic pose, in the colors of the German flag, painted in the style of an icon, surrounded by little monkeys. These \"painter monkeys\" were a recurring theme in Immendorff's work, serving as an ironic commentary on the artist's business.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nIn 2008, the Estate of the Artist contested the authenticity of a work that was offered at an auction, and the work was withdrawn from the sale. The artist's widow sought permission to have the work destroyed, which was granted in 2012 after the work was declared a fake. The original owner of the piece contested this ruling, and in 2014 the High Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf overruled the decision, claiming the authenticity of the work was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\nThe most expensive painting by the artist in the art market was Ende gut, alles gut (All's Well that Ends Well) (1983), who sold at Sotheby's London, on 7 February 2007, by \u00a3288,000 ($567,272).\n\n\n== External links ==\nJ\u00f6rg Immendorff in The Guardian 2021.\n\n\n== References ==", "David Hall (born 1937 in Leicester, died October 2014) was an English artist, whose pioneering work contributed much to establishing video as an art form.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nDavid Hall studied at Leicester College of Art and the Royal College of Art. During the 1960s he worked as a sculptor and showed his work internationally. He won first prize at the Biennale de Paris in 1965 and took part in other key shows including the seminal Primary Structures exhibition at the Jewish Museum, New York in 1966 which marked the beginning of Minimalist art.\nIn 1966 he was a founder of the pioneering artists' organisation Artist Placement Group, APG, along with Barbara Steveni, John Latham, Barry Flanagan, Anna Ridley, and Jeffrey Shaw among others. APG was a milestone in Conceptual Art in Britain, reinventing the means of making and disseminating art.\nIt was during this time he began working with film and at the beginning of the 1970s turned to video as an art medium.\nHis work in video and his writings in Studio International and elsewhere contributed to the establishment of this as a genre in the visual arts, and it was here he introduced the term \"time based media\". He was curator of early shows, and influenced emerging artists as a teacher.\nIn 1971 he made ten \"Interruptions\" broadcast intentionally unannounced and uncredited on Scottish Television. Seven of these works were later distributed on video as TV Interruptions (7 TV Pieces), and are acknowledged as the first artist interventions on British television and as an equally formative moment in British video art. The first multi-channel video installation shown in the UK was his 60 TV Sets at the exhibition A Survey of the Avant-Garde in Britain, Gallery House, London 1972, which was  expanded as 101 TV Sets  at The Video Show, Serpentine Gallery, London 1975 (both made in collaboration with the film artist Tony Sinden).\nIn 1972 he founded the audio visual workshop at Maidstone College of Art. and by 1975 had transformed this into the first time based media degree course in UK.\nIn 1976 he made This is a Television Receiver, transmitted by BBC television. Here David Hall revisited the theme of his classic This is a Video Monitor made in 1973. Other works by artists had been broadcast by now, but Hall set out to turn the domestic television set into a form of video sculpture through the intervention of his transmitted images.\nAlso In 1976 he initiated and was a founder of the artists' organisation London Video Arts in collaboration with Stuart Marshall, Stephen Partridge, Tamara Krikorian, Roger Barnard, David Critchley and others. This acted as a promotional agency, an artist-led workshop and a distribution service.\nHe has exhibited single screen and installation work internationally for more than forty years at many venues including Documenta Kassel, Tate Gallery London, Centre Georges Pompidou Paris, National Museum Reina Sofia Madrid, Museum of Contemporary Art Barcelona, and Museum of Modern Art Vienna.\nIn March and April 2012, in his solo exhibition End Piece ..., the centrepiece installation 1001 TV Sets (End Piece) (1972\u20132012) reprised the early 1970s works, and coincided with the switch-off of analogue broadcast transmissions in the London area. The exhibition, curated by Michael Maziere, also included two other installations Progressive Recession (1974) and TV Interruptions (7 TV Pieces): The Installation (1971/2006) and was at the Ambika P3 gallery, Marylebone Road, London, UK. A report in the Independent newspaper referred to him as the \"Godfather of British Video Art\".\nHall has sculpture, films, videotapes, installations and/or related material in the collections of the Tate Gallery London, Museum of Modern Art New York, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia Madrid, Gemeente Museum The Hague, West Australia Art Gallery Perth, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Arts Council of England, Contemporary Arts Society, British Film Institute, Great South West Corporation Atlanta USA, Richard Feigen Gallery New York, Visual Resources Inc.

His early work prefigured minimal art and conceptual art and he played a prominent role in the development of geometrical abstract art and post-conceptual art.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMorellet began to make still-life paintings at the age of 14 as he studied Russian literature in Paris. After completing his studies, he returned to Cholet in 1948, where he continued to paint, now in the spirit of the COBRA movement. After this short period of figurative/representational work, Morellet turned to abstraction in 1950 after encountering the Concrete art of Max Bill. Morellet then adopted a pictorial language of simple geometric forms: lines, squares and triangles assembled into two-dimensional compositions.  \nIn 1960, he was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d\u2019Art Visuel (GRAV), with fellow artists Francisco Sobrino, Horatio Garcia-Rossi, Hugo DeMarco, Julio Le Parc, Jean-Pierre Yvaral (the son of Victor Vasarely), Jo\u00ebl Stein, Vera Moln\u00e1r and Fran\u00e7ois Moln\u00e1r (the last two left the group shortly after). Morellet began at this time to work with neon tube lighting.\nFrom the 1960s on, Morellet worked in various materials (fabric, tape, neon, walls...) and in doing so investigated the use of the exhibition space in terms similar to artists of installation art and environmental art.  He gained an international reputation, especially in Germany and France, and he was commissioned to create work for public and private collections in Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S. One of his works is part of the permanent collection of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. In 2016/2017, the CILA staged a retrospective of Morellet's Light Art, the last exhibition to be curated by the artist himself, shortly before his death in May 2016.\n\n\n== Work ==\nMorellet's abstract ideal was, he said, tempered by the charming nihilism of Marcel Duchamp. For him, a work of art referred only to itself. \nHis titles are generally sophisticated, show some Duchampian word play, and describe the \"constraints\" or \"rules\" that he used to create them. Like other contemporary artists who use constraints and chance (or the aleatory) in their works, such as John Cage in music and the Oulipo group in literature, Morellet used rules and constraints established in advance to guide the creation of his works while also allowing chance to play a role in some of his compositions. This dialectic between the rigid rule-based procedure and chance situates his work within the Post-conceptual art category.\nHis rigorous use of geometry tends to create emotionally neutral work, and also placed him close to Minimal art and Conceptual art in his aims. He shared a particular affinity to the American artists Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt.\n\nSeries: R\u00e9partitions al\u00e9atoires (\"Chance divisions\") from the 1950s\nR\u00e9partition de 16 formes identiques - painted after his visit to the Alhambra of Granada\nSeries: Trames from the 1950s\nSeries: D\u00e9sint\u00e9grations architecturales (\"Architectural disintegrations\") from 1971\nSeries: G\u00e9om\u00e9tr\u00e9es from 1983\nSeries: D\u00e9figurations from 1988\nSeries: D\u00e9clinaisons de pi (\"Versions of pi\") from 1998\n\n\tAlbum de 10 s\u00e9rigraphies sur 10 ans (1952-1961), Fran\u00e7ois Morellet, 1975, Mus\u00e9e Groninger\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nApril 10, 2016, the first Fran\u00e7ois Morellet Prize (awarded to a personality for his writings on art) was awarded to Catherine Millet by Philippe M\u00e9aille.

She is best known for her portraits of imaginary subjects, or ones derived from found objects, which are painted in muted colours. Her work has contributed to the renaissance in painting the Black figure. Her paintings often are presented in solo exhibitions.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nLynette Yiadom-Boakye was born in London, UK where she currently lives and works. Her parents worked as nurses for the National Health Service after emigrating from Ghana in the 1960s. Yiadom-Boakye describes herself as \"a boring child--good grades, no mischief--but also quite good at living in my head, using my imagination as an escape.\" As a senior in high school, she took an art foundations course as an experiment and afterwards gave up her previous intentions to become an optician to become an artist Yiadom-Boakye attended Central St. Martins College of Art and Design (1996-7); however, she did not enjoy her time there, so she transferred to Falmouth College of Art (1997-2000) where she eventually was awarded her undergraduate degree in 2000. She then completed an MA degree at the Royal Academy Schools in 2003. It was there, in her final year of graduate school, that she came to a realization that changed the direction of her work, leading to her fame. In an interview with Dodie Kazanjian of Vogue she stated \u201cInstead of trying to put complicated narratives into my work, I decided to simplify, and focus on just the figure and how it was painted. That in itself would carry the narrative.\" Following college she worked jobs to support herself until 2006 when she received Arts Foundation Fellowship for painting and was able to afford to focus solely on painting.\nIn 2010 her work was recognized by Okwui Enwezor. With curator Naomi Beckwith, Okwui Enwezor catalogued her exhibition at Studio Museum in Harlem. She was among those nominated for the Turner prize in 2013. In addition to her artwork, Yiadom-Boakye has taught at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford University where she is a visiting tutor for their Master in Fine Arts programme. Her influence as a painter was recognized in the 2019 Powerlist and she was subsequently listed among the \"top 10\" of the most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK in 2020.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Artworks ===\nYiadom-Boakye's work consists mostly of painted portraits of imaginary Black subjects. Her paintings are predominantly figurative, with raw and muted colors. The characteristic dark palette of her work is known for creating a feeling of stillness that contributes to the timeless nature of her subjects. Her portraits of imaginary individuals feature people reading, lounging, and resting in traditional poses. She brings to the depiction of her subjects contemplative facial expressions and relaxed gestures, making their posture and mood relatable to many viewers. Commentators have attributed some of the acclaim of Yiadom-Boakye's work to this relatability. She strives to keep her subjects from being associated with a particular decade or time; many of her art pieces depict figures/people of African descent. This results in choices such as not painting shoes on her subjects, as footwear often serves as a time stamp. These figures usually rest in front of ambiguous backgrounds, floating inside monochromatic dark hues. These cryptic, but emotional backdrops remind commentators of old masters such as Velasquez and Degas.\nThe artist's style shifted slightly after the opening of her 2017 show \"In Lieu of a Louder Love\". The show featured a new, warmer colour scheme. Her subjects in this show included more vibrant details such as a checkered linoleum-floor, a bold headwrap and bathing suit, and a yellow, orange, and green background.\nAlthough each portrait only contains one person, the paintings typically are presented in groups that are arranged as if family portraits. With her expressive representations of the human figure, Yiadom-Boakye examines the formal mechanisms of the medium of painting and reveals political and psychological dimensions in her works, which focus on imaginary characters who exist beyond our world in a different time and in an unknown location. She paints figures who are intentionally removed from time and place, and has stated, \"People ask me, \u2018Who are they, where are they?\u2019\u2009What they should be asking is \u2018what' are they?\"\nYiadom-Boakye takes inspiration for her paintings from the found objects she uses as well as personal memories, literature, and art history of painting. She also finds inspiration from music and artists including: Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Nick Drake, Lisa Yuskavage, Chris Offili, and Isaac Julien.\nThe Tate Museum provides an introduction to her work that is extensive, to accompany a major exhibition of her work held from 2 December 2020 to 9 May 2021.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nFor an artist, Yiadom-Boakye is unusual in describing herself as a writer as much as a painter\u2014her short stories and prosy poems frequently appear in her catalogues.\n\nExamples of her works shown in catalogues includes five extracts from a detective novel entitled \"an Officer of the Law\" and some intermittent notes on criminality.  Her story \"an Officer of the Law\" is a fictional short story that utilizes animals for the characters. Yiadom-Boakye also creates poetry as shown in her intermittent note \"Something Close to a Confession.\" An example of this:\"Dead but for the life in me,\nWhere Black rivers run in the Bath,\nHaving eaten the Activist and her Cause\nAnd alerted the Ugly to all their Flaws \nI Bask where God cannot see me.\nOn Vacant lot, my eyes make water\n\nAnd draw the blinds against a Slaughter.\"In talks about her work, the artist notes that her writing is to her as her painting is, and explains that she \"writes the things she doesn't paint and paints all the things she doesn't write\". Her paintings are given poetic titles.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nAt a 2019 auction at Phillips in London, Yiadom-Boakye's Leave A Brick Under The Maple (2015), a life-size portrait of a standing man, sold for about $1 million.\nAt the 2022 Christie's 20th/21st Century Frieze Week season auction, Yiadom-Boakye's Highpower was estimated at \u00a3600,000 and sold for \u00a31,482,000\n\n\n== Subject for work of others ==\nPainted in 2017, Kehinde Wiley's Portrait of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Jacob Morland of Capplethwaite is displayed in the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, CT.\nA portrait of Yiadom-Boakye by photographer Sal Idriss is held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.\nPoem After an Iteration of a Painting by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Destroyed by the Artist Herself by Ama Codje was published by the Massachusetts's Review on December 26, 2019\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nYiadom-Boakye has staged numerous solo exhibitions at museums and galleries internationally. Her notable solo shows include Any Number of Preoccupations (2010), Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Verses After Dusk (2015), Serpentine Galleries, London; A Passion To A Principle (2016), Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Under-Song For a Cipher (2017), New Museum, New York; and Fly In League With The Night (2022-2023), Tate Britain, London.\nShe has also participated in a number of group shows and exhibitions, including the 55th Venice Biennale (2013); the Sharjah Biennial (2015); 58th Venice Biennale (2019), and Afro-Atlantic Histories (2021-2022). Yiadom-Boakye's work is included in several museum collections in the United States including the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami collection, and the picture King for an Hour was on view at the institution's long-term display for 2023.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nYiadom-Boakye has been widely hailed for her work, winning accolades including The Arts Foundation fellowship for painting (2006), the Pinchuk Foundation Future Generation Prize (2012), Next Generation Prize from the New Museum of Contemporary Art (2013), South Bank Sky Arts Award for Visual Art (2016) and the Carnegie Prize at 57th edition of Carnegie International (2018). She was also nominated for the Turner Prize (2013). \n\n\n== Notable works in public collections ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nOrlando Reade, \"Life Outside the Manet Paradise Resort: On the Paintings of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye\", The White Review, November 2012.\nEddie Chambers, \"Black British artists who should be better known\", The IB Tauris Blog, 7 August 2014.\nSmith, Zadie (19 June 2017). \"A bird of few words : narrative mysteries in the paintings of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye\".

He received a number of legal threats for his Internet art performances, including practices such as hacking, piracy, leaking sensitive information, identity theft, and cyber attacks.\nPaolo Cirio is known for having exposed over 200,000 Cayman Islands offshore firms with the work Loophole for All[1] in 2013; the hacking of Facebook through publishing 1 million users on a dating website with Face to Facebook in 2011; the theft of 60,000 financial news articles with Daily Paywall[2] in 2014 and of e-books from Amazon.com with Amazon Noir[3] in 2006; defrauding Google with GWEI[4] in 2005; and the obfuscation of 15 million U.S. criminal records with Obscurity[5] in 2016; exposing over 20,000 patents of technology enabling social manipulation in 2018. Recently, in 2020, he pirated over 100,000 Sotheby\u2019s auction records in Derivatives[6] and he attempted to profile 4000 French police officers with facial recognition in Capture.[7] His early works include his cyber attacks against NATO and reporting on its military operations since 2001 [8].\n\n\n== Career ==\nPaolo Cirio has won a number of awards, including the Golden Nica first prize at Ars Electronica in 2014; the Eyebeam Fellowship in 2012; and the Transmediale second prize 2008, among others.\nCirio has exhibited in international museums and institutions, he regularly gives public lectures and workshops at leading universities, and his artworks have been covered by hundreds of media outlets worldwide.\n\n\n== 2001 - 2004 ==\nIn 2002, Cirio's first international action was called Anti-NATO Day. As an act of Hacktivism he staged a virtual sit-in (DDoS attack) in the NATO website through a Flash Player script. The Canadian Department of National Defence investigated the action and the Eisenhower Institute used it as a case study to identify future vulnerabilities in space security. Cirio promoted the action through an anti-war web portal called StopTheNato.org, which he launched in 2001 and updated periodically until 2006.\nIn 2004, Cirio joined the Illegal Art Show network, which organized street art happenings in Italy in line with the Temporary Autonomous Zone philosophy. They occupied public spaces and invited artists to create and show artworks during the events. Cirio created several street art pieces  and organized three such events independently: two in Turin in 2004 and a third in London in 2005.\n\n\n== 2005 - 2007 ==\nIn 2005, Cirio hacked Google's AdSense service by creating internet bots for a click fraud in order to buy Google's shares with its own money. In an attempt to stop the project, Google sent a cease and desist letter to the artists mentioning legal consequences for the project.[9] Cirio worked on the project Google Will Eat Itself (GWEI) in conjunction with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen. The project questioned the information monopoly of Google and its revenue model.\nIn 2006 he eluded Amazon.com's protections with internet bots exploiting a vulnerability of the \"search inside\" service. He scraped complete texts of books, reassembled them into PDF files, and redistributed them for free. The company refused to comment on the action. In collaboration with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen, Cirio created the project Amazon Noir to criticize the abuse of copyright laws for digital content misappropriated by private corporations.\nFace to Facebook, Amazon Noir and Google Will Eat Itself together form the Hacking Monopolism Trilogy.\n\n\n== 2008 - 2010 ==\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Cirio worked on experimental storytelling, involving actors and audiences to present real facts and issues through fictional stories across multiple media platforms. He called this technique of documentary fiction  \"Recombinant Fiction.\"  This socially engaged genre of transmedia storytelling has resulted in two projects: Drowning NYC (2010) and The Big Plot (2009).\nIn 2010, in reaction to the late-2000s financial crisis, Cirio created the piece P2P Gift Credit Card - Gift Finance. Cirio issued thousands of illicit VISA credit cards in order to design a creative monetary policy, named \"Gift Finance\", which is a participatory and interest-free basic income guarantee system. In the following years, he presented the projects in relation to the economic recession and the related Occupy Wall Street protests.\n\n\n== 2011 - 2012 ==\nSince 2011, Cirio has been addressing the cultural shift and mainstream media attention toward popular perceptions of privacy and ownership of public and personal information, with the projects Street Ghosts, Persecuting.US, and Face to Facebook. The methodology used to create these artworks was eventually formalized in a series called Anti-Social Sculptures.\nIn 2011, Cirio created Face to Facebook with Alessandro Ludovico. For this piece, Cirio collected one million Facebook profiles, filtered them with artificial intelligence for facial recognition software, and published 250,000 of them onto Lovely-Faces.com, a mock dating website designed by Cirio, with the profiles sorted according to facial expressions. This resulted in eleven lawsuit threats, five death threats, and four legal letters from Facebook [10]. The legal repercussions were integrated into the artwork as a component part of a creative project within an expanded field. Within a few days, the project was covered by over a thousand media outlets [11] from around the world including CNN, Fox News, Tagesschau, and Apple Daily.\nWith the Street Ghosts project in 2012, Cirio recontextualized photos of individuals found on Google Street View, by printing and posting life-sized pictures of people in the exact locations where they were photographed. The posters were wheatpasted on the walls of public buildings without authorization. These interventions took place in public spaces of several major cities, including London, Berlin, and New York.\nIn 2012, his web project Persecuting.US profiled the political affiliations of over one million Americans who used Twitter during the months leading up to the 2012 United States presidential election. Cirio appropriated the data and algorithmically determined users\u2019 political affiliations to raise awareness on voter profiling and polarization in social bubbles that can be targeted for political manipulation.\n\n\n== 2013 - 2014 ==\nIn 2013, Cirio investigated offshore financial systems with the project Loophole for All. The project made public the list of all the companies registered in the Cayman Islands for the first time, exposing tax evasion practices by counterfeiting Certificate of Incorporation documents signed with his name. This information was published on the website Loophole4All.com, engaging international participation through selling the real identities of anonymous Cayman companies for 99 cents. This provocation elicited reactions from Cayman authorities and global banks as well as legal threats by multinational companies, international law firms, and local Cayman businesses. After three weeks of selling conceptual and subversive artworks in the form of limited editions of firms\u2019 identities, PayPal suspended the account, claiming the sales activity was in violation of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy. The project offered a creative approach to democratizing and making-known the financial privileges afforded to moneyed individuals and multinational corporations. In 2014 the project won the Golden Nica, first prize of Prix Ars Electronica.\nIn 2014, Cirio created the Global Direct project, a creative political philosophy that the artist outlined for worldwide participatory democracy within the potentials offered by the Internet. To illustrate the conceptual work, the artist drew a series of fifteen Organizational charts to inspire values and functions for a global and participatory society. The fifteen diagrams of Global Direct were informed by the artist\u2019s research into the social science of ancient, contemporary, and emergent democracy.\nIn 2014 Cirio created Daily Paywall by hacking the paywall of The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Economist. Through his paid subscriptions and Scripting language hack, he obtained over 60,000 news articles published during the course of 2014. The pay-per-view content was republished for free on the website DailyPaywall.com and the artist proposed to pay people to read featured financial news articles. Cirio conceived a provocative sharing economy model, where crowdsource was put in place to allow and incentivize people to access information on economic matters. Using this system, readers were able to earn money for every quiz about featured news they correctly completed, and journalists were able to claim compensation for their work. Everyone could donate any amount to crowdfund the system. After a few days, the ISP hosting DailyPaywall.com disabled the site after receiving complaints of international Copyright infringement from Pearson PLC, the education and publisher company and owner of the Financial Times and The Economist. Additionally The Wall Street Journal proceeded to terminate the artist\u2019s subscription due to a violation of their Terms of Service. In 2016, Pearson sold both The Economist and the Financial Times and Cirio republished the whole content of DailyPaywall.com. He entire artistic act was pre-scripted as a performance for illustrating critical issues on the Information economy that Cirio outlined within the launch of the project.\n\n\n== 2015 - 2016 ==\nDuring the spring of 2015, Cirio conducted the street art campaign OVEREXPOSED concerning the aftermath of Edward Snowden\u2019s global surveillance disclosures. He disseminated on public walls unauthorized photos of high-ranking U.S. intelligence officials of the NSA, CIA and FBI, who were accountable for political measures or advocacy for mass surveillance and espionage programs. The photos, mostly selfies from Facebook and Twitter accounts of civilians, were rendered with a particular technique called High Definition Stencils invented by the artist for the street art campaign that took place in NYC, London, Berlin and Paris between April and May 2015. The intervention generated media coverage and public interest internationally and particularly in Germany  \n in connection to the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal.\nIn 2016, Cirio created the project Obscurity in which he obfuscated over 10 million online mugshots and the criminal records of victims of mass incarceration in United States. The project addressed the unregulated mug shot publishing industry that anonymous internet companies exploit in order to shame and blackmail people who have been arrested in the U.S. regardless of their charges and trial verdicts. Cirio targeted six mugshot websites and blurred millions of mugshots and shuffled names listed. In response he received support from mugshot extortion victims and was subject to a legal threat from Mugshots.com, an anonymous firm in Nevis, and US Data ltd., a Texan firm owning a few mugshot websites. With Obscurity, Cirio questioned the Right to Be Forgotten law, which has been opposed by major search engine companies in the U.S. Ultimately, to point out the accountability of search engines in exposing personal sensitive information, Cirio designed the campaign Right2Remove.us [12] to introduce a privacy policy adapting the Right to Be Forgotten law to the United States. With the Right to Remove policy, Cirio suggested types of sensitive personal data that should be removed from online search results to protect specific categories of vulnerable individuals. The campaign formed a community of activists for the removal of online criminal records and a form of Right to be Forgotten in United States.\n\n\n== 2017 - 2018 ==\nDuring 2017, Cirio curated the Evidentiary Realism [13] exhibitions in NYC and Berlin art galleries featuring artists engaged in investigative, forensic, and documentary art. He articulated a particular form of realism in art that portrays and reveals evidence through investigation and research-based work. The exhibitions included historical artists such as Hans Haacke, Mark Lombardi, Jenny Holzer, and Harun Farocki. A collection of essays about the works presented were published in the book Evidentiary Realism [14].\nIn 2018, Cirio published the project Sociality [15] with over 20000 patents of algorithms, devices, and interfaces of social media, online advertising, and other Internet technologies, that he collected from Google Patents. He then rated the patents for finding the most potentially socially harmful ones. A selection of patents ordered by categories such as discrimination, polarization, addiction, deception, control, censorship, and surveillance were published on The Coloring Book of Technology for Social Manipulation [16]. On the project\u2019s website, visitors are invited to share, flag, and ban these patents in relation to the regulation of the information technology for monitoring and manipulating social behaviors. Furthermore, as a form of protest, Cirio posted printed patent titles and images at the main universities in U.S. such as at Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Berkley, and Columbia. This project responded to the scandals of Cambridge Analytica and Youtube algorithms that broke in 2018 and broadly it documents the history of the Internet with the advent of targeted advertising, corporate surveillance, and information feed filtered by artificial intelligence.\n\n\n== 2019 - 2020 ==\nDuring the fall of 2019, Cirio presented three new projects related to his concept of Internet Photography[17] focusing on the economic and legal aspects of images circulating online. Rather than addressing privacy, with these projects Cirio looked at the relations between cultural and economic values of online photos. In particular with the artwork Attention[18], Cirio addressed subtle forms advertising by Instagram influencers. Cirio collected hundreds of photos by online influencers promoting controversial products without disclaimers and in partnership with the University of Maastricht he investigated the legal implications of moderating and regulating such subtle advertising. \nIn the spring of 2019 with his work Foundations[19] he put forward an aesthetics of contemporary social complexity and the use of flowcharts as an artistic medium for seeing and engaging with such aesthetics. He published a monograph of his artworks using flowcharts to work with socio-economic information systems and a separate text book[20] for the project Foundations where he curated a selection of artworks, exhibitions, and publications from the history of conceptual art to identify an ontology of an aesthetics of social complexity.\nIn June 2020, Cirio launched the project Derivatives[21] online, with a database of over 100,000 Sotheby\u2019s auction records he assembled over several years. Cirio overlaid the auction prices on the images works to sell them as digital artworks on the website Art-Derivatives.com [22] for a fraction of the value set at the auctions. Cirio designed a \"future\" financial derivative contract for the sale of his derivative works. By betting against future prices of derivative works, with Cirio\u2019s concept everyone can ironically participate in the financialization of art. In addition, the project campaigns for enacting more transparency and fairness in the art market. In order to provoke regulation, Cirio has investigated secrecy and manipulation of art auctions with extensive research [23]. This project was reported by the international outlets as a controversial and investigative work.[24] [25] [26]\nIn October 2020, Cirio created the project Capture [27] with 4000 faces of French police officers assembled by a facial recognition system. Further, Cirio aimed to crowdsource the identification of the officer on his platform Capture-Police.com.  In response the interior minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin and police unions forced the take down of the project both online and at the exhibition in the French art institution  Le Fresnoy. This case of censorship of Cirio\u2019s work was largely reported internationally.[28][29][30] This provocation was designed by Cirio to promote his campaign #BanFacialRecognitionEU.[31] In 2021, Cirio concluded the campaign to ban facial recognition technology in Europe by delivering his legal research and complaint to the European Commission and EDPS with over 50,000 signatures supporting his petition.[32]\n\n\n== 2021 - 2023 ==\nOn October 9, 2021, Cirio established the first international climate crime tribunal though a solo exhibition at the historical museum of Certosa di San Giacomo in Capri. His concept of Climate Tribunal[33] combines a body of works about Climate Justice from a legal and economic standpoint. Cirio gathered data, graphs, and images as evidence to hold major oil, gas, and coal companies responsible for their greenhouse gas emissions. The historical scientific, legal, and economic evidence is presented by Cirio through fine artworks, online platforms, public events, and interviews with experts.\nCirio\u2019s Climate Tribunal integrates the science of the attribution of recent climate change with the legal concept of environmental personhood, and the rights of nature jurisprudential theory, informed by climate change litigation, ecocide bills, and global climate treaties. Central to Cirio\u2019s concept is the historical study Carbon Majors Database by the Climate Accountability Institute, the first to establish precise responsibilities for each international fossil fuel firm, and deduced that the major 100 oil, gas and coal producers have generated over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions.\nFor Dutch Design Week 2021, Cirio launched the project Extinction Claims[34] addressing ongoing Mass Extinction. On Extinction-Claims.com[35] Cirio aggregated data on 40,000 vulnerable species and the public can claim financial compensation from major fossil fuel companies on behalf of endangered species through an algorithm that Cirio made to calculate funding for the preservation of endangered species whose natural environments are threatened by climate change. Extinction Claims was part of a larger campaign for the introduction of a Carbon Tax dedicated to the preservation of ecosystems vulnerable to climate change. The project was awarded and presented at Fondazione Merz in 2022.\nBetween 2022 and 2023, Cirio received three grants to expand the conceptual framework of the Climate Tribunal, from Strasbourg University, New York University Tandon School of Engineering, and Hamburg University. Through these commissions, Cirio built platforms to visualize and engage online users by using the Carbon Majors Database.\nIn January 2023, Cirio launched the Climate Class Action, a campaign to organize lawsuits which would allow citizens to claim compensation from major fossil fuel companies. Cirio created the platform ClimateClassAction.com[36], where citizens can calculate monetary compensation for the personal damage caused by climate change.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nSelected awards include:\n\nPrix Ars Electronica 2005, Honorary Mention Net Vision category, for GWEI\nibizagrafica 2006, Honorary Mention, for Amazon Noir\nSt. Gilgen International School Media Award, 2006, for Amazon Noir\nIBM AWARD FOR NEW MEDIA/Stuttgarter Filmwinter, 2007, for Amazon Noir\nTransmediale Award 2008, Second Prize, for Amazon Noir\nCairo Prize 2009, Nominated, for Open Society Structures\nPrix Ars Electronica 2011, Award of Distinction, for Face to Facebook\nShare Festival Prize 2011, First Prize, for Face to Facebook\nEyebeam 2012, Fellowship in New York City\nPrix Ars Electronica 2014, Golden Nica, for Loophole for All\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHillis, Ken; Paasonen, Susanna; Petit, Michael (2015).

Biggs lives and works in New York City.\nBiggs' work focuses on individuals in extreme landscapes or situations and often navigates territory between art and science. Often working in collaborations with neuroscientists, aerospace engineers, astrophysicists and robots, her work draws connections between physical terrains and psychological, societal, or political dynamics.\nIn her videos, Biggs focuses on individuals in extreme landscapes, such as the Taklamakan desert of Western China, the Horn of Africa, the Arctic, and the Mars Desert Research station. Her work explores challenges faced by diverse groups including the Uighurs, Indonesian sulfur miners and Yemini refugees. She has captured such events as kayaks performing a synchronized ballet in Arctic waters and a NASCAR pit crew's grace struggle to service a racecar.\nBiggs\u2019 work has taken her into areas of conflict in the Horn of Africa and to Mars (as a crew member at the Mars Desert Research Station). She has collaborated with neuroscientists, Arctic explorers, aerospace engineers, astrophysicists, miners, Yemeni refugees, and a robot. Her earlier video work dealt with issues of psychosis and psychotropic drugs.\nBiggs was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts in 2018.\n\n\n== Recent work ==\nBiggs' work will be presented at the 2021 Armory Show, Javits Center, New York City, from 9\u201312 September 2021. Her work will be shown at a featured solo booth as part of \u201cFocus,\u201d a curatorial initiative curated by Wassan Al-Khudhairi.\nIn addition to videos, Biggs' recent work includes multi-discipline performances, often including multiple large-scale videos, live musicians, artificial intelligence, paraplegics and athletes. Her newest work incorporates footage shot by Biggs at refugee camps in Djibouti, in Ethiopian badlands, and at Mars simulations in Utah and the Himalayas. She has recently trained in space medicine, equestrian vaulting and arctic kayaking.\nOn April 8, 2021 Janet Biggs presented a livestream performance, \"Singular Value Decomposition,\" emerging from a collaboration between Arts at CERN, the official arts program of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Integrated Arts Research Initiative (IARI) at the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas (KU).\nOn 30 July 2020, Biggs created an experimental live online performance at Fridman Gallery in New York City. While Biggs directed remotely, singer and dancer Mary Esther Carter performed, accompanied by an Artificial intelligence entity named A.I. Anne, which was created by composer and music technologist Richard Savery.  Also in July 2020, the Boca Raton Museum of Art presented a new installation by Biggs, \"Solitary Acts.\"\nIn June 2019, Biggs presented 'Overview Effect', an exhibition of new video work, at the Cristin Tierney Gallery in New York City.\n As part of this exhibition, Biggs' premiered \"How the Light Gets In,\" a multi-media performance, at the Theater at the New Museum.\nIn December, 2018, Biggs had solo exhibitions and film screenings at the Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre and the Museum of Science and the Cosmos in the Canary Islands.\nIn May 2018, Biggs was included in \"Shots Across the Plane,\" at the Zurab Tsereteli Museum of Modern Art in Tbilisi, Georgia.\nIn 2017, the Neuberger Museum of Art (Purchase, New York) presented \"A Step on the Sun.\"\nIn addition, Biggs' work has recently been presented in shows at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (June, 2018), the 17\u00ba Festival Internacional de la Imagen (group exhibition as part of art + tech festival) in Manizales Colombia, \"Art & Coal\" (Kunst & Kohle), a group exhibition spanning 17 museums in the Ruhr Valley), at the Skulpturenmuseum Glaskasten Marl in Marl, Germany, \"For a gentle song would not shake us if we had never heard a loud one\" at the Fotografisk Center, Copenhagen, Denmark. and \"Videos for a Stadium\" at the University of Kentucky Art Museum (screening at the Commonwealth Stadium at University of Kentucky) Lexington, KY.\nBiggs was selected to be on Crew 181 of the Mars Desert Research Station, and has incorporated elements of space exploration in her latest work.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and screenings ==\nBiggs has recently been presented in solo shows and screenings at Cristin Tierney Gallery in New York City, Connersmith Gallery in Washington, DC, Barbara Polla's Analix Forever Gallery in Geneva, Smack Mellon in Brooklyn NY, and Galerie Anita Beckers in Frankfurt Germany.\nIn June 2017, at David Lynch's Club Silencio in Paris, Biggs presented a premier of her performance piece, \"Far From Home,\" which incorporated a live musical performance by Rhys Chatham and a reading by Frank Smith with video of her recent work in a Yemeni refugee camp in Djibouti and at the Mars Desert Research Station.\nIn 2015, the Blaffer Art Museum in Houston, Texas, presented Biggs' Echo of the Unknown, a multidimensional exhibition combining video, sound, and objects that explore the role of memory in the construction of identity. Drawing from her personal memories of the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s on family members, heroic stories of public figures coping with the disease, and research conducted with neurologists and geoscientists, Biggs raises fundamental questions about how we become\u2013and how we lose our sense of\u2013who we are.  In conjunction with Echo of the Unknown, Blaffer collaborated with more than a dozen UH colleges and Houston institutions on the Blaffer Art Museum Innovation Series, an ambitious slate of lectures, gallery talks and panel discussions, enhancing the exhibition\u2019s role as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary learning.\nIn 2014 Biggs was exhibited in the First International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Cartagena de Indias.\n\nThe Tampa Museum of Art presented a survey of Biggs' work in 2011.

His father was a coal dealer, his mother a dentist who took her son with her on art-viewing trips to Italy. West did not begin to study art seriously until he was 26, when, between 1977 and 1983, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna with Bruno Gironcoli.\n\n\n== Work ==\nWest began making drawings around 1970 before moving on to painted collages incorporating magazine images that showed the influence of Pop Art. His art practice started as a reaction to the Viennese Actionism movement has been exhibited in museums and galleries for more than three decades. Over the last 20 years he had a regular presence in big expositions like Documenta and the Venice Biennale.\nWest's artwork is typically made out of plaster, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, wire, polyester, aluminium and other, ordinary materials. He started to produce paintings, but then turned to collages, sculptures, portable sculptures called \"Adaptives\" or \"Fitting Pieces\", environments and furniture \u2013 \"welded metal chairs and divans, some minimally padded and upholstered in raw linen.\" For his early sculptures, West often covered ordinary objects\u2014bottles, machine parts, pieces of furniture and other, unidentifiable things\u2014with gauze and plaster, producing \"lumpy, grungy, dirty-white objects\".\nIn the late 1990s, West turned to large-scale lacquered aluminum pieces, the first (and several after) inspired by the forms of Viennese sausages, as well as the shapes of the Adaptives. With their monochrome colors and irregular patchwork surfaces, these works were also meant for sitting and lying. \n\nIt doesn't matter what the art looks like but how it's used.\nFranz West \n\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art with help from former Senior Curator of Contemporary Art, Darsie Alexander, hosted the very first \"comprehensive survey\" to ever been done in the U.S. of Franz West's artwork which contained his latest artwork designed specifically for the Baltimore Museum of Art, The Igo and the Id. \u2013 which \"consists of two configurations of rumpled, ribbon-like loops rising some 20 feet high. One is bright pink, the other neatly painted in blocks of green, yellow, blue and orange. Both have round stools projecting from the lower ends of the loops.\"\nFor the season 2009/2010 in the Vienna State Opera Franz West designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\nThroughout his career, West engaged in collaborations with other artists, such as conceptual Artist Bernhard Cella, conceptual artist Douglas Gordon, musician Fred Jellinek, furniture maker Mathis Esterhazy, and the artist Tamuna Sirbiladze (West's widow). For another exhibition in 2012, West collaborated with fellow artist Anselm Reyle on a series of furniture sculptures.\n\n\n=== Adaptives ===\nAround 1980 West started to create \"plaster objects, usually a few feet long, meant to be placed over the face, worn around the waist or held in the crook of the neck. Although they suggest masks and props for the commedia dell'arte, their shapes are usually ambiguous: no matter how figurative and sexual Mr. West's objects may be, they remain abstract. The pieces can be worn on the street or carried like a partner in an enraptured solipsistic dance. They leave the wearer looking both protected and trapped.\" His friend Reinhard Priessnitz called these \"Passst\u00fccke\", which was rendered into English as \"Fitting pieces\"; but West came to prefer another translation, \"Adaptives\".\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n1987 Wiener Secession, Vienna\n1988 Kunsthalle Bern, Bern\n1988 Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna\n1988 P.S.1, New York\n1990 Venice Biennale, Austrian Pavilion, Venice\n1991 Villa Arson, Nice\n1994 Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\n1996 Museum moderner Kunst, Stiftung Ludwig Wien, 20er Haus, Vienna\n1997 Funda\u00e7ao de Serralves, Porto\n1997 Museum of Modern Art, New York\n1998 Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum, Antwerpen\n2000 Museum f\u00fcr Neue Kunst - ZKM Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe\n2000 Renaissance Society, Chicago\n2001 Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien, Vienna\n2001 Deichtorhallen, Hamburg\n2002 Mus\u00e9e d'Art Contemporain (MAC), Marseille\n2002/03 Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, North Adams, MA\n2003 Kunsthaus Bregenz, Bregenz\n2003 Whitechapel Art Gallery, London\n2007 Werkstadt Graz, Graz\n2008 Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst Wien, Vienna\n2008 Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore\n2009 Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles\n2009 Fondation Beyeler, Basel\n2009/10 Museum Ludwig, Cologne\n2010 Museo MADRE, Neapel\n2010/11 Kunsthaus Graz, Graz\n2013 MUMOK, Vienna\n2013 Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh\n2013 MMK Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main\n2014 Williams College Museum of Art, Williamstown, USA\n2014 The Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield\n2016 21er Haus, Vienna\n2017 Viva Arte Viva, The 57th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy\n2018/19 Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and Tate Modern, London\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1986: Otto Mauer Prize, Vienna\n1988: City of Vienna Prize for Visual Arts\n1993: Sculpture Award at the Generali Foundation\n1998: Wolfgang-Hahn-Preis, Museum Ludwig, Cologne\n2011: Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement, Venice Biennale\n2011: Austrian Decoration for Science and Art\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWest was married to the Georgian artist Tamuna Sirbiladze, with whom he had two children.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nWest was represented by Gagosian Gallery, Galerie Meyer Kainer, Vienna, and Galerie Eva Presenhuber, Z\u00fcrich, until his death in 2012. Previously, David Zwirner had represented West in the US until 2001. At Frieze Art Fair in 2011, West curated the Gagosian Gallery's booth. A portrait of West made by Rudolf Stingel sold for a price of more than $500,000. West's estate continues to be represented by Gagosian Gallery.\nThe non-profit Franz West Archive was established by West, Eva Badura-Triska and others in 1997. In 2012, just days before he died, West signed paperwork authorising the formation of the Franz West Private Foundation which also operated the Franz West Werknutzungs GmbH; after a five-year battle over the artist's estate, however, the Regional Court for Civil Law of Vienna concluded in 2017 that the foundation  was created without a proper contract. The archive had previously sued the private foundation, as well as Gagosian Gallery and Galerie Eva Presenhuber, for selling the artist's furniture and photographs, claiming it owns the sole license for those works. In 2016, the archive sought to merge with the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien (mumok).\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nFranz West, Benedikt Ledebur: Extroversion \u2012 a Talk, Schlebr\u00fcgge.Editor, Vienna 2011.

He was at the center of a generation of German enfants terribles including Albert Oehlen, Markus Oehlen, Werner B\u00fcttner, Georg Herold, Dieter G\u00f6ls, and G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg.\n\n\n== Life ==\n \n\nKippenberger was born in Dortmund in 1953, the only boy in a family with five children, with two elder and two younger sisters. His father was director of the Katharina-Elisabeth colliery, his mother a dermatologist. When Kippenberger's mother was killed by a pallet falling off a truck, he inherited enough money to live on. He studied at the Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg, where Sigmar Polke, despite not teaching him directly, influenced him. After a sojourn in Florence, where he had his first solo show in 1977, he settled in Berlin in 1978. In that year he founded Kippenberger's Office with Gisela Capitain, mounting exhibitions of his own art and that of his friends. During that same period, Kippenberger also became business director of SO36, a performance, film and music space, and started a punk band called the Grugas, which recorded a single called Luxus with Christine Hahn and Eric Mitchell. Leaving Berlin, originally for a long visit to Paris, Kippenberger spent the early 1980s as an active member of the Cologne art scene.\nIn Cologne, as elsewhere, Kippenberger did not limit himself to producing works of art; he worked on how the art was presented, the framework and the sideshows. \"Martin was tremendously committed to the gallery's artists,\" Max Hetzler said. The Vienna gallerist Peter Pakesch thinks Kippenberger did an enormous amount for the Hetzler Gallery's success in his double role \"as clown and strategist... Max without Martin's strategy would have been unimaginable in the early years.\" According to artist Jutta Koether, Kippenberger \"was the one who brought movement to life so that it became known outside Cologne.\"\nIn 1984, he became a founding member of the Lord Jim Lodge. After moving to Los Angeles in late 1989, he bought a 35% share in ownership of the Italian restaurant Capri in Venice, Los Angeles. He stayed in Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald as a guest of the Gr\u00e4sslin family of art collectors from 1980 to 1981, and later on and off from 1991 to 1994, in order to work but also to recover from his excessive life. In his last years he taught at the St\u00e4delschule and the Kassel Art Academy.\nMartin Kippenberger died at age 44 from liver cancer at the Vienna General Hospital.\n\n\n== Work ==\nKippenberger\u2019s refusal to adopt a specific style and medium in which to disseminate his images resulted in an extremely prolific and varied oeuvre which includes an amalgam of sculpture, paintings, works on paper, photographs, installations, prints and ephemera.\nThroughout the 1980s, Kippenberger\u2019s artwork underwent periods of strong political reflection. During a trip to Brazil in 1986, Kippenberger bought a gas station by the sea in Salvador de Bahia and renamed it the Martin Bormann Gas Station. With the fictionally acquired gas station, Kippenberger gave Martin Bormann a camouflage address and the possibility of an income in exile; Kippenberger allegedly installed a telephone line and employees were obliged to answer calls with \u2018Tankstelle Martin Bormann\u2019. Later accused of neo-Nazi attitudes by German critic Wolfgang Max Faust, he made several life-size, dressed mannequin sculptures of himself, called Martin, ab in die Ecke und sch\u00e4m Dich (Martin, into the Corner, You Should Be Ashamed of Yourself) (1989), placed facing the wall.\nKippenberger also felt that he was working in the face of a 'perceived death of painting' and his art reflects his struggle with the concept that, at the turn of the millennium, it was impossible to produce anything original or authentic. Blass vor Neid steht er vor deiner T\u00fcr [Pale with Envy, He Stands Outside Your Door] (1981), for instance, comprises twenty-one individual canvases shown together as one work, but each canvas has a separate title and there is no consistent style. In 1987 he integrated a 1972, all-gray abstract painting by Gerhard Richter, which he himself had purchased, into the top of a coffee table. For the photorealist paintings from a series titled Lieber Maler, Male Mir or Dear Painter, Paint Me, Kippenberger hired a commercial painter named Werner to make them and signed them Werner Kippenberger. Untitled [The installation of the White Paintings] make formal reference to debates around language-based conceptual art as a critique of the \u2018empty\u2019 white cube gallery space. In a first series of works alluding to Picasso that were to follow in 1988, Kippenberger took this project further, looking to the ultimate Modern icon as a contemporary foil. Restaging a well-known photograph by David Douglas Duncan of Picasso standing in a 'puffed-up' state of undress on the steps of Ch\u00e2teau Vauvenargues in 1962 Kippenberger was parodying his famous antecedent, playfully subverting the machismo associated with the genre of self-portraiture. First adopted as a motif in his 1988 series of self-portraits undertaken in Carmona, Spain, Kippenberger depicted himself with white briefs pulled up high over his exaggerated belly, as he turned to examine himself in a mirror.\nKippenberger made the first of Laterne (Lamp) sculptures in 1988, a year that he spent largely living in Seville and Madrid in Spain. This work, Laterne an Betrunkene ('Street Lamp for Drunks') has become well known through its exhibition at the 1988 Venice Biennale. The original motif of the lamp sculptures derived in part from the photographs that filled Kippenberger's 1988 artist's book, \"Psychobuildings\".\nIn 1989, Kippenberger and fellow artist Jeff Koons worked together on an issue of the art journal Parkett; the following year, Koons designed an exhibition poster for Kippenberger.\nIn 1990, while sojourning in New York City, Kippenberger started a body of work collectively known as the Latex or Rubber paintings. Also in the 1990s, influenced by the Lost Art Movement, Kippenberger had the idea of an underground network encircling the whole world. Located on the Greek island of Syros and in Dawson City, Canada, false subway entrances are part of the Metro-Net World Connection series (1993\u20137) Kippenberger built as private commissions; a sizable length of subway grating, complete with the sounds of trains and gusts of wind, was exhibited posthumously at the Venice Biennale.\nThe Happy End of Franz Kafka\u2019s \u2018Amerika\u2019 (1994) explores the fictional utopia of universal employment, adapting Kafka\u2019s idea of communal job interviews into an artwork. The installation consists of a diverse assortment of objects and furniture, assembled to suggest a playing field for conducting mass interviews. There are over 40 tables and twice as many chairs, from classics of twentieth-century design, such as chairs by Arne Jacobsen and Charles Eames, to worn-out tables bought in flea markets, remnants of previous Kippenberger exhibitions, and even work by other artists.\nDuring the last 10 years of his life Kippenberger created a series of drawings on hotel stationery, which are commonly referred to as the 'hotel drawings' (1987\u20131997). Originally undertaken as ad hoc preparatory diagrams for the three-dimensional Peter sculptures, he later used the myriad letterheads of innumerable hotels to capture other subjects and inspirations. Collected in his travels, Kippenberger conceived them in thematic series (portraits of scientists, portraits of Frank Sinatra, depictions of war etc.). His late collages incorporate photographs (Polaroids, film stills, magazine clips), prints (one by Sigmar Polke), exhibition posters from past Kippenberger shows, some folded up origami-style, self-produced decals, and photographed and rephotographed drawings. Executed in 1996 as part of the series, Untitled offers a depiction of Kippenberger standing side by side with his daughter Helena as a little girl.\nIn the final two series, Kippenberger first can be seen posing like Picasso\u2019s last wife, Jacqueline, subtitling the piece The Paintings Pablo Couldn\u2019t Paint Anymore. In the complex of lithographs entitled Medusa (1996), Kippenberger used photography as his starting point although, this time, he himself posed for wife and photographer Elfie Semotan, mimicking the postures of the characters in the famous painting The Raft of the Medusa (1819) by Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault (1791-1824).\nIn 2011, Kippenberger's When It Starts Dripping From the Ceiling was accidentally destroyed by a janitor in a Dortmund museum who believed she was cleaning stains off of the work.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIn 1985, Kippenberger exhibited \"Buying America and Selling El Salvador\" at Metro Pictures Ltd in New York, a large installation comprising numerous sculptural works. Although he had his first museum exhibition at Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt in 1986, he drew greater attention from institutions outside Germany, with exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1993) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1994).\nKippenberger's artistic reputation and influence has grown since his death. In 2003, he represented Germany at the Venice Biennale (with Candida H\u00f6fer). He has since been the subject of several large retrospective exhibitions, including at the Tate Modern in 2006 and \"the Problem Perspective\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2008; the exhibition traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2009. In 2011, the Museo Picasso Malaga hosted 'Kippenberger Meets Picasso'. This exhibition showed how Kippenbeger was interested in Pablo Picasso, an artistic attraction resulted in works, and entire series, that were direct references to the Spanish artist.\nIn 2013 the newly founded Greek Organization for Culture and Development, NEON, presented the work of the German artist in the exhibition A Cry for Freedom, curated by Dimitris Paleocrassas at the Museum of Cycladic Art, in Athens, Greece with works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection and the Estate Martin Kippenberger, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne. The exhibition presented over 60 works including paintings, sculptures, hotel drawings and photographs, and is the first time that Kippenberger\u2019s work will be displayed in a museum environment in Greece.\n\nKippenberger collected and commissioned work by many of his peers: some of his exhibition posters were designed by such prominent artists as Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Rosemarie Trockel and Mike Kelley.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nWhile Kippenberger's star has risen steadily since his death, his market has evolved in several distinct stages. His work was only considered auction-worthy toward the very end of his life, and even then, it rarely sold for more than $10,000. Only in spring 2005 at Phillips de Pury & Company, an untitled 1991 painting sold for $1,024,000. In 2011, Kippenberger's lamp sculpture Untitled (1990) was sold for \u00a31,329,250 ($2,094,898) at Christie's London.\nKippenberger's self-portraits have in the past achieved the highest prices. In 2012, an untitled self-portrait sold for \u00a33.2 million ($5.1 million) at a Christie's London Evening sale. In 2014, Kippenberger\u2019s untitled 1988 self-portrait, restaging a photograph of the 81-year-old Picasso in his white underwear taken by David Douglas Duncan, fetched $18.6 million. Later that year, Larry Gagosian bought a 1988 self-portrait by Kippenberger, which shows the artist in his underwear, for $22.5 million at Christie's in New York.\nKippenberger is represented by Galerie Gisela Capitain, with representation by Skarstedt, New York in the United States. \n\n\n== Legacy ==\nKippenberger's art garnered some recognition in the mid-nineties when three pieces were used by Welsh alternative rock music group Manic Street Preachers as the cover artwork on the three singles released from their third album, The Holy Bible, in 1994: part four of the five-part Fliegender Tanga (\"Flying Tanga\"), which would be sold for \u00a32,561,250 in 2010, was used for the first single \"Faster/P.C.P.\"; a 1983 piece, Sympatische Kommunistin (\"Nice Communist Woman\"), appeared on part one of the two-part single \"Revol\"; and, Titten, T\u00fcrme, Tortellini (\"Tits, Towers, Tortellini\"), credited under its French title \"Des t\u00e8tons, des tours, des tortellini\", was the cover artwork on both parts of the two-part, third single \"She Is Suffering\".\nIn 2008, during an exhibition at the Museion in Bozen, Italy, a sculpture by Kippenberger depicting a toad being crucified called Zuerst die F\u00fcsse (\"First the Feet\") was condemned by Pope Benedict as blasphemous, despite the museum's explanation that it was a \"self-portrait illustrating human angst\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nChristopher Kippenberger\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNew York Times obituary by Roberta Smith\nHolland Cotter review of 2009 retrospective show at MOMA\nSFMOMA Collection\nPostmedia page\nThe Saatchi Gallery - Martin Kippenberger, Gallery In London with images, information, text and biography about Martin Kippenberger\nMartin Kippenberger on Artcyclopedia\nTate Modern - Martin Kippenberger, retrospective 8 February 2006 \u2013 14 May 2006\nSkarstedt Gallery New York\nCrucified frog controversy\nGerman Crucified Frog Sculpture Angers Catholics in Italy\nMartin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective / Museum of Modern Art MoMA New York, 2009\nMartin Kippenberger Fan Shop\nErik Bakke review of 2009 retrospective at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\nMuseo Picasso Malaga exhibition on Kippenberger\nLa mirada paseante: Kippenberger.

His father was an aerospace engineer. He first worked as a lab technician for the British Rubber Producers Research Association after high school. He studied art at Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology, Cheltenham, from 1968 to 1970, and painted at the Wimbledon School of Art, London, from 1970 to 1973. The same year he went on to study sculpture at the Royal College of Art, London, completing an MA in 1977.\nHe moved to Wuppertal in 1977 because his first wife was from there. There were also cheap studio spaces and exhibition organisers looking for new artists. He was fascinated by the importance of sculpture in Germany, and struck by German seriousness.\nIn 1979 Daniel the first of his 4 children was born. He is currently married to the artist Tatjana Verhasselt.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nTony Cragg's early work involved site-specific installations of found objects and discarded materials.\nFrom the mid-1970s through to the early 1980s he presented assemblages in primary structures (as in his first mature piece, the 1975 Stack) as well as in colourful, representational reliefs on the floors and walls of gallery spaces (as in Red Indian of 1982\u201383). Cragg constructed these early works by arranging individual fragments of mixed materials, often according to their artificial colours and profiles, so as to form larger images.\nIn 1977 Cragg moved to Wuppertal, Germany and had several solo exhibitions including Lisson Gallery, London (1979); L\u00fctzowstra\u00dfe Situation, Berlin (1979) and K\u00fcnstlerhaus Weidenallee, Hamburg (1979). He also exhibited in seminal group shows including the Silver Jubilee Sculpture Show, Battersea Park, London (1977); Europa-Kunst der 80er Jahre, Stuttgart (1979); Kunst in Europa na '68, Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Gent (1980) and L'art degli anni Settanta/Aperto '80, Venice Biennale (1980).\n\nIn 1981 he created \"Britain Seen from the North\" considered a signature early work, made of multi-coloured scraps of various materials assembled in relief on the wall. The piece depicts the outline of the island of Great Britain, orientated sideways so that Northern Britain is positioned to the left. The island is scrutinized by a figure, representing Cragg himself, who looks at his native country from the position of an outsider. The piece is often interpreted as commenting on the social and economic difficulties that Britain was facing under Thatcherism, which had particular effect in the north. This work was first exhibited in the large upstairs space at the Whitechapel Art gallery in London in 1981 and is now in the Tate collection.\nIn the early 1980s Cragg gradually moved away from installation art and began to examine more closely the individual objects used as parts of his larger constellations. This was the beginning of his engagement and experimentation with the properties and possibilities of a wide range of more permanent materials in the form of wood, plaster, stone, fiberglass, Kevlar, stainless steel, cast iron and bronze. During this time Cragg exhibited at Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol (1980); Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1980); Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal (1981); Institute of Contemporary Art, London (1982); Documenta 7, Kassel (1982) and the Hayward and Serpentine Galleries, London (1983). Since then Cragg has exhibited extensively at many of world's most important art institutions.\n\nIn 1988 Cragg received the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery in London, represented Britain at the 42nd Venice Biennale (1988) and was appointed Professor at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf (1988\u20132001).\nThroughout the 1990s Cragg continued to develop two larger groups of work that have sustained his production up to the present: the \"Early Forms\" and the \"Rational Beings\". The Early Forms series investigate the possibilities of manipulating everyday, familiar containers and the ways in which they can morph into and around one another in space. The sculptures derive their profiles and contours from simple, tick-walled vessels such as chemistry vessels, plastic bottles and mortars. The surface of these initial objects are extended and contorted until new, sculpturally independent forms of movement arise. Through these processes of manipulation the initial objects develop new lines and contours, positive and negatively curving surfaces and volumes, protrusions and deep recessing folds. The broad field of containers and vessels used function as metaphors for cell, organ, organism or body. The Early Forms can be characterized as forms transmutating along a bilaterally curved axis, often with organic, even figurative, qualities. The Rational Beings are describable as organic looking forms often made of carbon fibre on a core of polystyrene. These sculptures derive their forms from the contours of gestural drawings, which Cragg then translates into the third dimension using thick, circular or oval discs which are superimposed (often vertically), glued together and covered with a skin.\nDuring the 1990s he exhibited at the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); the \"Terrae Motus\" collection at the Royal Palace of Caserta, Italy (1994); The National Gallery, Prague (1995); MNAM, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1996); MACBA, Barcelona (1997) and the Royal Academy, London (1999). In the early 2000s Cragg was awarded the Shakespeare Prize (2001) and the Piepenbrock Prize for Sculptures (2002). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) (2002), Honorary Doctor of the Royal College of Art, London (2009), Professor at the Universit\u00fct der K\u00fcnste, Berlin (2001\u20132006), and began a Professorship at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf (2006). Among many major solo shows, Cragg exhibited at Tate Gallery Liverpool (2000); MACRO Museum of Contemporary Art, Rome (2003); and The Central House of Artists, Moscow (2005).\nIn 2011 Cragg exhibited at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh and in 2012 at CAFA Museum in Beijing. His sculpture Accurate Figure is currently on display in the garden at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas. Amongst new developments in Cragg's work is an increase in sculptures that can be exhibited outdoors; more works wrought from bronze, steel, stone, wood and glass; as well as a vigorous return to his initial interest in art \u2013 that of drawing.\nFollowing Brexit he became a German Citizen. He stated that he had found his life in Germany and \"wouldn't like to experience any disadvantages in the future either\".\n\n\n== Waldfrieden Sculpture Park & the Cragg Foundation ==\n\nThe Cragg Foundation is a non-profit general foundation based in Wuppertal. It was founded in 2005 by the Cragg family and incorporated on 13 December 2005. It includes  Tatjana Cragg as chairperson, Tony Cragg as deputy chairperson and Michael Br\u00e4mer. Its foundation purpose is \"Art and culture \u2013 in general\".\nThe foundation runs the 25 acre Waldfrieden Sculpture Park in the Barmer district of Hesselnberg, Wuppertal. There is a house and 2 other exhibition buildings in a wooded park. The park opened in 2008. There are about 40 outdoor sculptures by various artists including Tony Cragg, Henry Moore, Jaume Plensa, Thomas Sch\u00fctte, Richard Deacon, Eva Hild, Bogomir Ecker, Hubert Kiecol, Hede B\u00fchl and Markus L\u00fcpertz. There are temporary exhibitions, and a music and lecture programme.\n\n\n== Recognition, awards ==\n\nCragg was selected to represent Britain at the 43rd Venice Biennale in 1988, and won the Turner Prize in the same year. \nIn the early 1990s, Cragg was awarded the Chevalier des Arts Lettres (1992) and appointed Royal Academician in London (1994). \nIn 2001 he received the now discontinued Shakespeare Prize of the Alfred Toepfer Foundation of Hamburg. He was made a CBE for services to art in the 2002 New Year Honours List, and also won the Piepenbrock Prize for Sculpture in that year. In 2007, he received the Praemium Imperiale for sculpture of the Imperial House of Japan for the Japan Art Association.\nSince 2010, Cragg has been appointed Honorary Fellow of University of the Arts London (2012); awarded Artist's Medal of Honor of the Hermitage, Russia (2012) as well as the Grand Cross 1st Class Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2012). In 2018 he was awarded the Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia; the Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.\nIn 2014 he was awarded honorary citizenship of Wuppertal.\nIn the 2016 Birthday Honours Cragg was created a Knight Bachelor for services to visual arts and UK-German relations.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nNew Forms (sculpture), Houston, Texas\nRunner (sculpture)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nSkulpturenpark Waldfrieden", "Andrew Newell Wyeth ( WY-eth; July 12, 1917 \u2013 January 16, 2009) was an American visual artist, primarily a realist painter, working predominantly in a regionalist style. He believed he was also an abstractionist, portraying subjects in a new, meaningful way. The son of N. C. Wyeth and father of Jamie Wyeth, he was one of the best-known U.S. artists of the middle 20th century. James H. Duff explores the art and lives of the three men in An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art. Raised with an appreciation of nature, Wyeth took walks that fired his imagination. Henry David Thoreau, Robert Frost, and King Vidor's The Big Parade (1925) inspired him intellectually and artistically. Wyeth featured in a documentary The Metaphor in which he discussed Vidor's influence on the creation of his works of art, like Winter 1946 and Portrait of Ralph Kline. Wyeth was also inspired by Winslow Homer and Renaissance artists.\nHis father, N. C., gave him art lessons as a child, during which he developed the skills to create landscapes, illustrations, works of figures, and watercolor paintings. He also instilled a sense of passion and purpose in creating art that \"enriches and broadens one's perspective.\" His brother-in-law, Peter Hurd, taught him to use egg tempera. Wyeth's wife, Betsy, managed his career and was also a strong influence in his work.\nOne of the best-known images in 20th-century American art is his tempera painting Christina's World, currently in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which was painted in 1948, when Wyeth was 31 years old. Wyeth is also known for The Helga Pictures. \nIn his art, Wyeth's favorite subjects were the land and people around him, both in his hometown of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and at his summer home in Cushing, Maine. Also appearing in his works are his friend's Kuerner Farm and an 18th-century mill, Brinton's Mill, that Wyeth and his wife purchased. He made a collection of about 300 paintings of windows which were presented in the National Gallery of Art's 2014 exhibition, \"Andrew Wyeth: Looking Out, Looking In\". In the 1960s, he began to paint portraits of family members, friends, and neighbors. Wyeth often said: \"I paint my life.\" \nSummarizing the variation of opinions about his work, art historian Robert Rosenblum said that \nWyeth was the \"most overrated and underrated\" artist. He was known for his skill at creating watercolor and tempera paintings that engage one's senses and emotions. Christina's World became an iconic image, a status unmet by even the best paintings, \"that registers as an emotional and cultural reference point in the minds of millions.\" Among the awards and honors that he received since 1947 are the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medals and he was elected to Britain's Royal Academy.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Childhood ===\n\nAndrew was the youngest of the five children of illustrator and artist Newell Convers (N. C.) Wyeth and his wife, Carolyn Bockius Wyeth.  He was born July 12, 1917, on the 100th anniversary of Henry David Thoreau's birth. Due to N. C. 's fond appreciation of Henry David Thoreau, he found this both coincidental and exciting.  N. C. was an attentive father, fostering each of the children's interests and talents. The family was close, spending time reading together, taking walks, fostering \"a closeness with nature\" and developing a feeling for Wyeth family history.\nAndrew was home-tutored because of his frail health. Like his father, the young Wyeth read and appreciated the poetry of Robert Frost and the writings of Henry David Thoreau and studied their relationships with nature. Music and movies also heightened his artistic sensitivity. One major influence, discussed at length by Wyeth himself, was King Vidor's The Big Parade (1925). He claimed to have seen the film, which depicted family dynamics similar to his own, \"a hundred-and-eighty-times\" and believed it had the greatest influence on his work. Vidor later made a documentary, The Metaphor, where he and Wyeth discuss the influence of the film on his paintings, including Winter 1946, Snow Flurries, Portrait of Ralph Kline and Afternoon Flight of a Boy up a Tree.\nWyeth's father was the only teacher that he had. Due to being schooled at home, he led both a sheltered life and one that was \"obsessively focused\". Wyeth recalled of that time: \"Pa kept me almost in a jail, just kept me to himself in my own world, and he wouldn't let anyone in on it. I was almost made to stay in Robin Hood's Sherwood Forest with Maid Marion and the rebels.\"\nN. C. Wyeth was an illustrator known for his work in magazines, posters and advertisements. He created illustrations for books such as Treasure Island and The Last of the Mohicans. By the 1920s, Wyeth senior had become a celebrity, and the family often had celebrities as guests, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Mary Pickford.  The home bustled with creative activity and competition. N. C. and Carolyn's five children were all talented. Henriette Wyeth Hurd, the eldest, became a painter of portraits and still lifes. Carolyn Wyeth, the second child, was also a painter. Nathaniel Wyeth, the third child, was a successful inventor. Ann was a musician at a young age and became a composer as an adult.  Andrew was the youngest child.\n\n\n=== N. C. Wyeth's guidance ===\n\nWyeth started drawing at a young age. He was a draftsman before he could read.  By the time he was a teenager, his father, N. C. Wyeth, brought him into his studio for the only art lessons he ever had and inspired his son's love of rural landscapes, sense of romance, and artistic traditions.  Although creating illustrations was not a passion he wished to pursue, Wyeth produced illustrations under his father's name while in his teens.\nWith his father's guidance, he mastered figure study and watercolor, and later learned egg tempera from his brother-in-law Peter Hurd. He studied art history on his own, admiring many masters of Renaissance and American painting, especially Winslow Homer.\nN. C. also fostered an inner self-confidence to follow one's own talents without thought of how the work is received.  N. C. wrote in a letter to Wyeth in 1944:\n\nThe great men Thoreau, Goethe, Emerson, Tolstoy forever radiate a sharp sense of that profound requirement of an artist, to fully understand that consequences of what he creates are unimportant.  Let the motive for action be in the action itself and not in the event. I know from my own experience that when I create with any degree of strength and beauty I have no thought of consequences.  Anyone who creates for effect\u2014to score a hit\u2014does not know what he is missing!\nIn the same letter, N. C. correlates being a great person with being a great painter:  To be a great artist, he described, requires emotional depth, an openness to look beyond self to the subject, and passion. A great painting then is one that enriches and broadens one's perspective.\nIn October 1945, his father and his three-year-old nephew, Newell Convers Wyeth II (b. 1941), were killed when their car stalled on railroad tracks near their home and was struck by a train. Wyeth referred to his father's death as a formative emotional event in his artistic career, in addition to being a personal tragedy. Shortly afterwards, Wyeth's art consolidated into his mature and enduring style.\n\n\n=== Marriage and children ===\nOn May 15, 1940, Wyeth married Betsy James, whom he met in 1939 in Maine.  Christina Olson, who was to become the model for Christina's World, met Wyeth through an introduction by Betsy.  Betsy, had an influence on Andrew as strong as that of his father, such that N. C. Wyeth began to resent her. She played an important role managing his career. She was once quoted as saying, \"I am a director and I had the greatest actor in the world.\"\n\nThe couple had two sons. Nicholas was born in 1943. Jamie Wyeth, born in 1946, followed his father's and grandfather's footsteps, becoming the third generation of Wyeth artists. Andrew painted portraits of both children (Nicholas and Faraway of Jamie). Andrew was the role model and teacher to his son Jamie that his father, N. C., had been to him. The artistic history is told in James H. Duff's An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nOn January 16, 2009, Andrew Wyeth died in his sleep in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, after a brief illness. He was 91 years old.\nHis wife Betsy died on April 21, 2020, at the age of 98.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nInspired by Winslow Homer's watercolors, Wyeth painted an impressionistic watercolor, Coot Hunter, about 1933.  There he experimented with the \"fleeting effects of light and movement\". In 1937, at age twenty, Wyeth had his first one-man exhibition of watercolors at the Macbeth Gallery in New York City. The entire inventory of paintings sold out, and his life path seemed certain. His style was different from his father's: more spare, \"drier,\" and more limited in color range. He stated his belief that \"the great danger of the Pyle school is picture-making.\" He did some book illustrations in his early career, but not to the extent that N. C. Wyeth did. Public Sale (1943, Philadelphia Museum of Art), is one of his first tempera paintings.\nWyeth was a visual artist, primarily classified as a realist painter, like Winslow Homer or Thomas Eakins. In a Life magazine article in 1965, Wyeth said that although he was thought of as a realist, he thought of himself as an abstractionist: \"My people, my objects breathe in a different way: there's another core\u2014an excitement that's definitely abstract. My God, when you really begin to peer into something, a simple object, and realize the profound meaning of that thing\u2014if you have an emotion about it, there's no end.\" Some feel Wyeth's work went against modernist ideals by embodying middle-class values, but this caused conversations about his work to extend beyond painting to social class.\nHe worked predominantly in a regionalist style. In his art, Wyeth's favorite subjects were the land and people around him, both in his hometown of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and at his summer home in Cushing, Maine. In 1958, Andrew and Betsy Wyeth purchased and restored \"The Mill\", a group of 18th-century buildings that appeared often in his work, including Night Sleeper (1979, private collection). Brinton's Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\nDividing his time between Pennsylvania and Maine, Wyeth maintained a realist painting style for over seventy years. He gravitated to several identifiable landscape subjects and models. His solitary walks were the primary means of inspiration for his landscapes. He developed an extraordinary intimacy with the land and sea and strove for a spiritual understanding based on history and unspoken emotion. He typically created dozens of studies on a subject in pencil or loosely brushed watercolor before executing a finished painting, either in watercolor, drybrush (a watercolor style in which the water is squeezed from the brush), or egg tempera. Ring Road (1985) reflects the earth tones that Wyeth used throughout his career. Raven's Grove (1985) is a prime example of Wyeth's mastery of egg tempera and his evolution as an artist.\nAfter N. C. Wyeth's death, his work began to take on a melancholic tone.  Wyeth painted Winter 1946 (1946, North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, 1946), which depicts a neighbor boy, Allan Lynch, running aimlessly down a bleak hill, his hand reaching out. The location of the work was the other side of the hill where his father had died and represented the unsettling, free-falling sense of loss.\n\n\n=== Christina Olson and the Olson Farm ===\n\nIt was at the Olson farm in Cushing, Maine, that he painted Christina's World (1948). Perhaps his best known work, it depicts his neighbor, Christina Olson, sprawled on a dry field facing her house in the distance. Wyeth was inspired by Christina, who, crippled from (undiagnosed) Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, a genetic polyneuropathy, and unable to walk, spent most of her time at home.\nThe Olson house has been preserved and renovated to match its appearance in Christina's World. It is open to the public as a part of the Farnsworth Art Museum. After being introduced to the Olsons by Betsy James, Wyeth built a friendship with the siblings and was soon allowed full roam of the farm and house where he did a number of works and studies of the Olson House and property. Because of Wyeth's profile, the property was designated a National Historic Landmark in June 2011.\n\n\n=== Kuerner Farm ===\n\nWyeth began painting Anna and Karl Kuerner, his neighbors in Chadds Ford. Like the Olsons, the Kuerners and their farm were one of Wyeth's most important subjects for nearly 30 years. He stated about the Kuerner Farm, \"I didn't think it a picturesque place. It just excited me, purely abstractly and purely emotionally.\" Brown Swiss  (1957, private collection) is one of many paintings that he made from the 1950s to the 1970s of Karl and Anna Kuerner's farm in Chadds Ford.  While the painting is named after the Brown Swiss cows Karl Kuerner owned, it shows the Kuerner farmhouse and the reflection of the house in the farm pond.  However, Wyeth ultimately decided not to include any cows in the painting; only their tracks in the grass remain.\nChadds Ford contained a small enclave of African-Americans known as \"Little Africa.\" The community settled around Mother Archie's Church, a Quaker schoolhouse converted to a house of worship. Andrew Wyeth painted the church in several landscapes during its active period, and the abandoned building walls appear in Ring Road (1985). African-American residents of Little Africa appear as recurring models for Wyeth's paintings.  The Kuerner Farm is available to tour through the Brandywine River Museum, as is the nearby N. C. Wyeth House and Studio; in 2011, the farm was declared a National Historic Landmark, based on its association with Wyeth.\n\n\n=== Helga paintings ===\n\nIn 1986, extensive coverage was given to the revelation of a series of 247 studies of the German-born Helga Testorf, whom Wyeth met while she was attending to Karl Kuerner at his farm. Wyeth painted her over the period 1971 to 1985 without the knowledge of either his wife or Helga's husband, John Testorf. Helga, a caregiver with nursing experience,  had never modeled before but quickly became comfortable with the long periods of posing, during which he observed and painted her in intimate detail. The Helga pictures are not an obvious psychological study of the subject, but more an extensive study of her physical landscape set within Wyeth's customary landscapes. She is nearly always portrayed as unsmiling and passive; yet, within those deliberate limitations, Wyeth manages to convey subtle qualities of character and mood, as he does in many of his best portraits. This extensive study of one subject in differing contexts and emotional states is unique in American art.\nIn 1986, Philadelphia publisher and millionaire Leonard E.B. Andrews (1925\u20132009) purchased almost the entire collection, preserving it intact. Wyeth had already given a few Helga paintings to friends, including the famous Lovers, which had been given as a gift to Wyeth's wife.\nThe works were exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in 1987 and in a nationwide tour. There was extensive criticism of both the 1987 exhibition and the subsequent tour.  The show was \"lambasted\" as an \"absurd error\" by John Russell and an \"essentially tasteless endeavor\" by Jack Flam, coming to be viewed by some people as \"a traumatic event for the museum.\" The curator, Neil Harris, labeled the show \"the most polarizing National Gallery exhibition of the late 1980s,\" himself admitting concern over \"the voyeuristic aura of the Helga exhibition.\"\nThe tour was criticized after the fact because, after it ended, the pictures' owner sold his entire cache to a Japanese company, a transaction characterized by Christopher Benfey as  \"crass.\"\nIn a 2007 interview, when Wyeth was asked if Helga was going to be present at his 90th birthday party, he said \"Yeah, certainly. Oh, absolutely,\" and went on to say, \"She's part of the family now. I know it shocks everyone. That's what I love about it. It really shocks 'em.\"\n\n\n=== Window paintings ===\n\nWyeth created about 300 works of art\u2014drawings and paintings of tempora and watercolor\u2014of windows. His son, Jaime, stated that his father was \"obsessed with windows\". In 2014, the National Gallery of Art held an exhibition, \"Andrew Wyeth: Looking Out, Looking In\", of 60 works of art that depict windows, such as Wind from the Sea (1947), Spring Fed (1967), Off at Sea (1972), and Rod and Reel (1975). Wind from the Sea depicts a breeze entering a window on the upper floor of the Olson house. It is an example of non-figurative portraiture and was a favorite of the poet Robert Frost.\nMade in Cushing, Maine and Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania over decades, the works showcase his growth as an artist. The National Gallery of Art states that the windows artwork \"offer[s] the clearest understanding of Wyeth's creative process\" because his paintings of people inspire questions about who the person is and what they are doing. Without the distraction of figures, the viewer is better able to assess the use of \"symbolism, light, color, lines and shapes.\"\nWyeth illustrated different perspectives, like works of windows seen through windows, flowing curtains, and life outside the windows. Of Wind from the Sea, Wyeth said of his summer at Olson farm,  \n\nThat summer in 1947 I was in one of the attic rooms feeling the dryness of everything and it was so hot I pried open a window. A west wind filled the dusty, frayed lace curtains and the delicate crocheted birds began to flutter and fly. . . . My whole idea is to keep myself open for the elusive something [that might catch me] off balance when [I] least expect it. I drew a very quick sketch and had to wait for weeks for another west wind for more studies.\n\n\n=== Portraits ===\n\nWyeth began to add portraits in the 1960s, such as Up in the Studio (1965), a drybrush portrait of his sister Carolyn. Garret Room, a painting of Wyeth's friend Tom Clark, (1962, private collection) was begun in watercolor and finished with the drybrush technique. Adam (1963, Brandywine Museum), is a tempera painting of a neighbor, Adam Johnson, who lived near Wyeth. \nIn works such as The Patriot (1964), a portrait of Ralph Cline, Wyeth looked beyond the surface to understand who he was painting. Cline was an interesting gentleman 71 years of age, of Native American heritage and Maine humor. He wore a big hat and overalls and chewed tobacco. It was through painting him, though, that Wyeth understood that, beneath his humor and hard countenance, Cline was a warm-hearted veteran of great dignity and intellect.\nWhen Christina Olson died in the winter of 1969, Wyeth refocused his artistic attention upon Siri Erickson, capturing her naked innocence in The Sauna. It was a prelude to the Helga paintings.\nMaidenhair (1974, Andrew and Betsy Wyeth collection), a tempera painting of a lone female figure sitting in a church pew at the Old German Meeting House in Waldoboro, Maine. It is a companion piece to Crown of Flowers.\n\n\n=== Critical reaction ===\nWyeth's art has long been controversial. He developed technically beautiful works, had a large following and accrued a considerable fortune as a result.  Yet critics, curators and historians have offered conflicting views about the importance of his work. Art historian Robert Rosenblum was asked in 1977 to identify the \"most overrated and underrated\" artists of the 20th century. He provided one name for both categories: Andrew Wyeth.\nAdmirers of Wyeth's art believe that his paintings, in addition to their pictorial formal beauty, contain strong emotional currents, symbolic content, and underlying abstraction. Most observers of his art agree that he is skilled at handling the medium of egg tempera (which uses egg yolk as its medium) and watercolor. Wyeth avoided using oil paints. His use of light and shadow lets the subjects illuminate the canvas. His paintings and titles suggest sound, as is implied in many paintings, including Distant Thunder (1961) and Spring Fed (1967). Christina's World became an iconic image, a status unmet to even the best paintings, \"that registers as an emotional and cultural reference point in the minds of millions.\"\nWyeth created work in sharp contrast to abstraction, which gained currency in American art and critical thinking in the middle of the 20th century.\nMuseum exhibitions of Wyeth's paintings have set attendance records, but many art critics have evaluated his work less favorably. Peter Schjeldahl, art critic for The Village Voice, derided his paintings as \"Formulaic stuff, not very effective even as illustrational 'realism'.\" Some found Wyeth's art of rural subject matter tired and oversweet.\nN. C. advised Wyeth to work from one's own perspective and imagination; to work for \"effect\" means the artist is not fully exploring their artistic abilities and, as a result, the artist will not realize their potential.\n\n\n=== Museum collections ===\nWyeth's work is held in the following permanent collections:\n\nThe collections of most major American museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the National Gallery of Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Cincinnati Art Museum;  the Smithsonian American Art Museum,  the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City; the Arkansas Art Center in Little Rock; and the Muscarelle Museum of Art in Williamsburg, VA. President George W. Bush and Laura Bush decorated a room of the White House in Washington, D.C., with Wyeth paintings from their collection.\nEspecially large collections of the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine; and the Greenville County Museum of Art in Greenville, South Carolina.\nMuseum collections throughout the world, including the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo; the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg; the Palazzo Reale in Milan; and the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts in Paris, among many other museums.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n\nWyeth was the recipient of numerous honors and awards:\n\n1947, the gold medal for painting from the American Academy of Arts and Letters\n1960, elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n1963, the first painter to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n1967, elected to the American Philosophical Society\n1977, the first American artist since John Singer Sargent to be elected to the French Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts\n1980, the first living United States artist to be elected to Britain's Royal Academy\n1987, a D.F.A. from Bates College\n1988, the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States legislature\n2007, the National Medal of Arts\nHe also received numerous honorary degrees.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Programs ===\nWilliam E. Marks interviewed Andrew Wyeth in 1977. It aired on MVTV and included photos of Wyeth painting en plein air.\nMichael Palin in Wyeth's World, a BBC programme, was broadcast on 20 December 2013. Presenter Michael Palin examines the life and work of the artist.\nIn 2018, PBS broadcast a documentary, as part of its American Masters series: Wyeth, on the artist's life and paintings.\n\n\n=== References to Christina's World ===\nIn \"Springfield Up\", a 2007 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns has a painting of Christina's World in his den, except he is pictured instead.\nIn the graphic novel series Preacher, issue 43 (2011) is named after the painting Christina's World. The painting is also referenced throughout the series.\nIn the 2013 film Oblivion, Christina's World is featured as the fantasy image of the world.\nIn the movie War on Everyone (2016), Jackie (Tessa Thompson's character) has a print of Christina's World hanging in her bedroom. While reflecting on the image, Terry (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) \"remarks on its eerie image of a young woman crawling over a grassy landscape.\"\nIndie singer-songwriter Ethel Cain, commonly associated with the southern gothic genre, recreated Christina's World in the music video for \"American Teenager\".\n\n\n=== Inspired by Wyeth's works ===\nIn his autobiography Man with a Camera, cinematographer Nestor Almendros cites Wyeth as one of the inspirations for the look of the film Days of Heaven (1978).\nThe Helga series of paintings was the inspiration for the 1987 album Man of Colours by the Australian band Icehouse.\nThe director Philip Ridley stated that his film The Reflecting Skin (1990) was inspired in its visual style by the paintings of Wyeth.\nTom Duffield, the production designer for the American remake of The Ring (2002), was inspired by Wyeth's paintings for the look of the film.\nM. Night Shyamalan based his movie The Village (2004) on paintings by Andrew Wyeth.\nFaraway (2014), an art song inspired by Wyeth's painting Faraway.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nCartoonist Charles M. Schulz (a longtime admirer) often referred to Wyeth in his comic strip Peanuts. Snoopy's doghouse had a Van Gogh and a Wyeth painting.\nFred Rogers, of the PBS television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, had a reproduction of a Wyeth painting in the entry of the studio \"home\".\nThe street names of the neighborhood of Thunder Hill, in the village of Oakland Mills in the city of Columbia, Maryland, are derived from the paintings of Wyeth.\nCamille Grammer states (on Season 9 Episode 18 of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\"), that her Andrew Wyeth painting was among the few items that she took from her home when being evacuated during the Woolsey Fire in Southern California that burned down her house.\nIn 2022 (Episode 9 of Season 4), of Donald Glover's TV series Atlanta is entitled \"Andrew Wyeth.

His work is most often associated with abstraction.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born on 6 August 1932 in Hammersmith, London, the son of Eliot Hodgkin (1905\u20131973), a manager for the chemical company ICI and an amateur horticulturist, and his wife Katherine, a botanical illustrator. During the Second World War, Eliot Hodgkin was an RAF officer, rising to Wing Commander, and was assistant to Sefton Delmer in running his black propaganda campaign against Nazi Germany.\nHis maternal grandfather Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart was a journalist, lawyer, Member of Parliament (MP) and Lord Chief Justice; and the scientist Thomas Hodgkin was his great-great-grandfather's older brother. Hodgkin was a cousin of the English still life painter Eliot Hodgkin (1905\u20131987).\nDuring the Second World War, Hodgkin was evacuated with his mother and sister to the US, where they lived on Long Island, New York. On returning, he was educated at Eton College and then at Bryanston School in Dorset. He had decided on a career in art in early childhood and ran away from school to pursue this.\nHe studied at the Camberwell Art School and later at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, where Edward Piper studied drawing under him.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nMemoirs (1949), one of Hodgkin's earliest recorded paintings, shows the artist, then aged 17, listening to a female figure reclining on a sofa. Painted with angular forms and black outlines, the work precedes Hodgkin's distinct abstract style.\nHodgkin's first solo show was in London in 1962.\nIn 1980, Hodgkin was invited by John Hoyland to exhibit work as part of the Hayward Annual at the Hayward Gallery along with Gillian Ayres, Basil Beattie, Terry Setch, Anthony Caro, Patrick Caulfield, Ben Nicholson and others.\nIn 1981, Hodgkin had collaborated with the Rambert Dance Company's Resident Choreographer, Richard Alston, for his abstract work 1981 for the production of Night Music and later for the production of Pulcinella in 1987.\nIn 1984, Hodgkin represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, in 1985 he won the Turner Prize, and in 1992 he was knighted.\n\n\n=== British Council in India ===\nHodgkin was invited to design a mural for the front of Charles Correa's 1992 headquarters for the British Council in India.  Hodgkin's mural is of a banyan tree spreading its branches across the walls.  It is a symbol of the British Council's work rooted in the Indian cultural scene.  Hodgkin said of Correa:    \u201cCharles Correa is the most perfect architect you could imagine. He first suggested that I think about the mural as an Indian flag turning into a Union Jack. I said no.\u201d\nIn 1995, Hodgkin printed the Venetian Views series, which depict the same view of Venice at four different times of day. Venice, Afternoon \u2013 one of the four prints \u2013 uses 16 sheets, or fragments, in a hugely complex printing process that creates a colourful, painterly effect. This piece was given to the Yale Centre of British Art in June 2006 by its Israeli family owners in order to complement the museum's already-impressive collection of Hodgkins.\nA major exhibition of his work was mounted at Tate Britain, London, in 2006. Also in 2006, The Independent declared him one of the 100 most influential gay people in Britain, as his work has helped many people express their emotions to others.\nIn September 2010, Hodgkin and five other British artists, John Hoyland, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj, were in an exhibition entitled The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie, at the Yale Center for British Art.\n\nBefore his death on 9 March 2017 he was working on two UK exhibitions, one at the Hepworth Wakefield, and another at the National Portrait Gallery.\nHis prints were hand-painted etchings and he worked with the master printer Jack Shirreff at 107 Workshop.\nA feature of his painting was that he made the frame intrinsic to the work \"incorporated physically into the painting as part of its making, or created as an illusion to give definition to his subject.\"\nNational Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C466/286) with Howard Hodgkin between 2008 and 2017 for its Artists' Lives collection held by the British Library.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nHodgkin was appointed a CBE in 1977, and he was knighted in 1992. He received an honorary fellowship from the London Institute in 1999. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Oxford. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2003 New Year Honours for his services to art. Hodgkin was named 2014 Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1955, Hodgkin married Julia Lane, by whom he had two children. Hodgkin knew he was gay, even when he was married, and later left his wife. In 2009, The Independent reported that he had been with his partner, the music writer Antony Peattie, for 20 years. They lived in a four-storey Georgian house in Bloomsbury, near the British Museum.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn 9 March 2017, Hodgkin died at the age of 84 in a hospital in London. Tributes to him were made by several figures in British art, including Tate director Nicholas Serota.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMichael Auping; John Elderfield; Susan Sontag; Marla Price (1995).

Considered a central figure in the development of American postwar art, he has been variously associated with abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, and pop art movements. \nJohns was born in Augusta, Georgia, and raised in South Carolina. He graduated as valedictorian from Edmunds High School in 1947 and briefly studied art at the University of South Carolina before moving to New York City and enrolling at Parsons School of Design. His education was interrupted by military service during the Korean War. After returning to New York in 1953, he worked at Marboro Books and began associations with key figures in the art world, including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he had a romantic relationship until 1961. The two were also close collaborators, and Rauschenberg became a profound artistic influence.\nJohns's art career took a decisive turn in 1954 when he destroyed his existing artwork and began creating paintings of flags, maps, targets, letters, and numbers for which he became most recognized. These works, characterized by their incorporation of familiar symbols, marked a departure from the individualism of Abstract Expressionist style and posed questions about the nature of representation. His use of familiar imagery, such as the American flag, played on the ambiguity of symbols, and this thematic exploration continued throughout his career in various mediums, including sculpture and printmaking.\nAmong other honors, Johns received the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1988, the National Medal of Arts in 1990, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1973 and the American Philosophical Society in 2007. He has supported the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and contributed significantly to the National Gallery of Art's print collection. Johns is also a co-founder of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He currently lives and works in Connecticut. In 2010, his 1958 painting Flag was sold for a reported $110 million in a private transaction, becoming the most expensive artwork sold by a living artist.\n\n\n== Life ==\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia, Jasper Johns spent his early life in Allendale, South Carolina, with his paternal grandparents after his parents divorced. He began drawing at the age of three and knew very early on that he wanted to be an artist, despite having little exposure to the arts where he grew up. His paternal grandfather\u2019s first wife, Evalina, painted landscapes that hung in the homes of several family members. These paintings were the only artworks Johns remembers seeing in his youth. Following his grandfather's death in 1939, Johns spent a year living with his mother and stepfather in Columbia, South Carolina, and then six years living with his Aunt Gladys on Lake Murray, South Carolina. He spent summer holidays with his father, Jasper, Sr., and stepmother, Geraldine Sineath Johns, who encouraged his art by buying materials for him to draw and paint. He graduated as valedictorian of Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother and her family. \nJohns studied art for a total of three semesters at the University of South Carolina at Columbia, from 1947 to 1948. Encouraged by his professors, he then moved to New York City and enrolled briefly at the Parsons School of Design in 1949. In 1951, Johns was drafted into the army during the Korean War, serving for two years, first in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and then in Sendai, Japan.\nReturning to New York in the summer of 1953, Johns worked at Marboro Books and began to meet some of the artists who would be formative in his early career. These included Sari Dienes, Rachel Rosenthal, and Robert Rauschenberg, with whom Johns began a romantic and artistic relationship that would last until 1961. During the same period Johns was strongly influenced by the choreographer Merce Cunningham and his partner, the composer John Cage. Working together they explored the contemporary art scene, and began sharing their ideas on art.\nIn March 1957, while visiting Rauschenberg's studio, the gallery owner Leo Castelli asked to see Johns's art. As Castelli recalled: \u201cSo we went down. It was just the floor below. There was a fantastic display of flags and targets. You know the target with the plastic eyes, the one with the faces. The Green Target was at the Jewish Museum, but there was a big white flag, a smaller white flag, numbers, the alphabet, anything\u2014all those great masterpieces.\" Castelli immediately offered Johns an exhibition. His first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, held in early 1958, was well received; all but two of the eighteen works on view sold. Alfred H. Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's Museum of Modern Art, purchased three paintings from the show, which were the first works by Johns to enter a museum collection. \nJohns has lived and worked in various homes and studios in New York City throughout his career and, from 1973 to 1987, maintained a rustic 1930s farmhouse with a glass-walled studio in Stony Point, New York. He began visiting the Caribbean island of Saint Martin in the late 1960s, buying property there in 1972, and, later, building a home and studio, for which Philip Johnson was the principal designer. Johns currently lives and works in Sharon, Connecticut.\nFollowing his death, the artist plans to transform his 170-acre property in Sharon, Connecticut, into an artists\u2019 residency. He has lived there since the 1990s. It will provide a live-work space for 18 to 24 artists at a time and will be open to visual artists, poets, musicians, dancers.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Painting ===\nIn 1954, Johns destroyed all of his previous artwork still in his possession and began the paintings for which he is best known: depictions of flags, maps, targets, letters, and numbers. His use of such symbols differentiated his paintings from the gestural abstraction of the Abstract Expressionists, whose works were often understood as expressive of the individual personality or psychology of the artist. With well-known motifs imported into his art, his paintings could be read as both representational (a flag, a target) and as abstract (stripes, circles). Some art historians and museums characterize his choice of subjects as freeing him from decisions about composition. Johns has remarked: \"What\u2019s interesting to me is the fact that it isn\u2019t designed, but taken. It\u2019s not mine,\u201d or, that these motifs are \"things the mind already knows.\"\nHis early encaustic painting Flag (1954\u201355), painted after having a dream of it, marks the beginning of this new period. The motif allowed Johns to create a painting that was not completely abstract because it depicts a symbol (the American flag), yet it draws attention to the design of the symbol itself. The work evades the personal because it depicts a national symbol, and yet, it maintains a sense of the handmade in Johns's wax brushstrokes; it is neither a literal flag, nor a purely abstract painting. The work thus raises a set of complex questions with no clear answers through its combination of symbol and medium. Indeed, Alfred H. Barr could not convince the trustees of the Museum of Modern Art to directly acquire the painting from Johns's first solo show, as they were afraid its ambiguity might lead to boycott or attack by patriotic groups during the Cold War climate of the late 1950s. Barr was, however, able to arrange for the architect Philip Johnson to buy the painting and later donate it to the museum in 1973. The flag remains one of Johns\u2019s most enduring motifs; the art historian Roberta Bernstein recounts that \u201cbetween 1954 and 2002, he employed virtually his full array of materials and techniques in twenty-seven paintings, ten individual or editioned sculptures, fifty drawings, and eighteen print editions that depict the flag as the primary image.\"\nJohns is also known for including three-dimensional objects in his paintings. These objects can be either found (the ruler in Painting with Ruler and \u201cGray,\u201d 1960) or specifically made (the plaster reliefs in Target with Four Faces, 1955). This practice challenges the typical conception of painting as a two-dimensional realm. Johns\u2019s early and enduring use of the medium of encaustic also presented the opportunity to experiment with texture. An ancient technique, encaustic is a process whereby melted wax mixed with pigment is applied and \u201cburned into\u201d a support. The method allowed Johns to preserve the discrete quality of individual brushstrokes, even when layered, creating textured yet, at times, transparent surfaces. Johns's 2020 work Slice reproduces a drawing of a knee by J\u00e9an-Marc Togodgue, a Cameroonian emigre student basketball player who attended the Salisbury School near Johns's estate in Sharon. Johns's use of Togodgue's artwork without first notifying him led to a dispute that was settled amicably.\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nJohns made his first sculpture, Flashlight I, in 1958. Many of his earliest sculptures are single, freestanding objects modeled from a material called Sculp-metal, a pliable metallic medium that could be applied and manipulated much like paint or clay. During this period, he also employed casting techniques to make objects out of plaster and bronze. Some of these objects are painted to suggest a certain sense of verisimilitude; Painted Bronze (1960), for example, depicts a can painted with the Savarin Coffee label. Filled with cast paintbrushes, the work recalls an object one might find on an artist\u2019s studio table.\nNumbers (2007), which depicts his now classic pattern of stenciled numerals repeated in a grid, and is the largest single bronze Johns has made to date. Another sculpture from this period, a double-sided relief titled Fragment of a Letter (2009), incorporates part of a letter from Vincent van Gogh to his friend, the artist \u00c9mile Bernard. On one side of the relief, Johns pressed each letter of van Gogh's words into the wax model. On the other side, he spelled each letter in the American Sign Language alphabet using stamps he designed. Johns signed the wax model with impressions of his own hand, his name finger-spelled in two vertical rows. \n\n\n=== Prints ===\nJohns began experimenting with printmaking techniques in 1960, when Tatyana Grosman, the founder of Universal Limited Art Editions, Inc. (ULAE), invited him to her printmaking studio on Long Island. Beginning with lithographs that explore the common objects and motifs for which he is best known, such as Target (1960), Johns continued to work closely with ULAE, publishing over 180 editions in a variety of printmaking techniques to investigate and develop existing compositions. Initially, lithography suited Johns and enabled him to create print versions of iconic depictions of flags, maps, and targets that filled his paintings. In 1971, Johns became the first artist at ULAE to utilize the handfed offset lithographic press, resulting in Decoy \u2014 an image realized as a lithograph before it became a drawing or painting. \nJohns has worked with other printmakers throughout his career, producing lithographs and lead reliefs at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles; screenprints with Hiroshi Kawanishi at Simca Prints in New York from 1973\u201375; and intaglios published by Petersburg Press at Atelier Crommelynck in Paris from 1975\u201390, including a collaboration with the author Samuel Beckett that resulted in Foirades/Fizzles (1976), a book of five text fragments by Beckett in French and English and 33 intaglios by Johns. He produced Cup 2 Picasso as an offset lithograph for the June 1973 issue of the magazine XXe si\u00e8cle and, in 2000, completed an edition of 26 linocuts printed by the Grenfell Press and published by Z Press to accompany Jeff Clark's Sun on 6. For the May 2014 issue of Art in America, he created an unnumbered black-and-white off-set lithograph depicting many of his signature motifs.\nIn 1995, Johns hired master printmaker John Lund and began to construct his own printmaking studio on his property in Sharon, Connecticut. Low Road Studio was officially founded in 1997 as Johns\u2019s own publishing imprint.\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nFor decades Johns worked with others to raise both funds and attention for Merce Cunningham's Dance Company. He assisted Robert Rauschenberg in some of his 1950s designs for Cunningham's sets and costumes. In spring 1963, Johns and John Cage cofounded the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts (now the Foundation for Contemporary Arts), to raise funds in the performance field. Johns continued his support of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and served as an artistic adviser from 1967 to 1980. In 1968 Cunningham made a Duchamp-inspired theater piece, Walkaround Time, for which Johns's set design replicates elements of Duchamp's work The Large Glass (1915\u201323). Earlier, Johns also wrote Neo-dada lyrics for The Druds, a short-lived avant-garde noise music art band that featured prominent members of the New York proto-conceptual art and minimal art community. The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, owns Chuck Close's large-scale portrait of Johns. In the late 1960s Johns' work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde journal which experimented with language and meaning-making\n\n\n=== Commissions ===\nIn 1963, the architect Philip Johnson commissioned Johns to make a work for what is now the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center. Numbers (1964), a 9-by-7-foot grid of numerals, debuted in 1964 and, after presiding over the theater's lobby for 35 years, was supposed to be sold by the center for a reported $15 million in 1979. Numbers is historically important because it is the largest work of the artist's Numbers motif, and each of its Sculp-metal and collage units is on a separate canvas. Responding to widespread criticism, the board of Lincoln Center decided to drop its plans to sell the work, which was Johns's first and only public commission.\n\n\n=== Style ===\nJohns's work is sometimes grouped with Neo-Dada and pop art: he uses symbols in the Dada tradition of the readymades of Marcel Duchamp, but unlike many pop artists such as Andy Warhol, he does not engage with celebrity culture. Other scholars and museums position Johns and Rauschenberg as predecessors of pop art.\n\n\n== Valuation and awards ==\nIn 1980 the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, paid $1 million for Three Flags (1958), then the highest price ever paid for the work of a living artist. In 1988, Johns's False Start (1959) was sold at auction at Sotheby's to Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. for $17.05 million, setting a record at the time as the highest price paid for a work by a living artist at auction, and the second highest price paid for an artwork at auction in the U.S. In 1998, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, bought Johns's White Flag (1955), the first painting by the artist to enter the Met's collection. While the museum would not disclose how much was paid, the New York Times reported that \"experts estimate [the painting's] value at more than $20 million.\"  In 2006, Johns's False Start (1959) again made history. Private collectors Anne and Kenneth Griffin (founder of the Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel LLC) purchased the work from David Geffen for $80 million, making it the most expensive painting by a living artist. In 2010, Flag (1958), was sold privately to hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen for a reported $110 million (then \u00a373 million; \u20ac81.7 million). The seller was Jean-Christophe Castelli, son of Leo Castelli, Johns's dealer, who had died in 1999. While the price was not disclosed by the parties, the New York Times reported that Cohen paid about $110 million. On November 11, 2014, a 1983 version of Flag was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York for $36 million, establishing a new auction record for Johns.\nJohns has received many awards throughout his career. The sole honorary degree he has accepted is Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, which the University of South Carolina conferred upon him in 1969. In 1984, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Boston. In 1988, he received the highest honor at the 43rd Venice Biennale\u2014the Golden Lion\u2014for his exhibition in the United States pavilion. Johns was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1989. In 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. That year he was also elected an associate national academician of the National Academy of Design (now the National Academy Museum and School), rising to national academician in 1994. In 1993, he received the Praemium Imperiale for painting, a lifetime achievement award from the Japan Art Association. In 1994 he was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1973 and the American Philosophical Society in 2007. On February 15, 2011, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, becoming the first painter or sculptor to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom since Alexander Calder in 1977. \nIn 2007, the National Gallery of Art acquired about 1,700 of Johns's prints. This made the gallery home to the largest number of Johns's works held by a single institution.\n\n\n== Selected work ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn \"Mom and Pop Art,\" a 1999 episode of the animated television series The Simpsons, Johns guest stars as himself. He is depicted as a thief who steals everyday objects such as lightbulbs.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nJasper Johns: An Allegory of Painting, 1955\u20131965, an exhibition at the US National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\nStates and Variations: Prints by Jasper Johns, an exhibition at the US National Gallery of Art\nJasper Johns (born 1930) Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art\nJasper Johns at the Museum of Modern Art\nJasper Johns bio at artchive.com\nPBS Jasper Johns 2008\nJasper Johns at IMDb\nJasper Johns discography at Discogs\nPowers Art Center - A Showcase of Jasper Johns's Works on Paper\nJasper Johns's Three Flags at Art Beyond Sight (Art Education for the Blind)\nReview of the Whitney and the Philadelphia museums' 2021 shows at Artnet News, \tOctober 12, 2021\nThe Formulaic Juxtapositions of Jasper Johns's 'Mind/Mirror', at Frieze, November 12, 2021", "Rosemarie Trockel (born 13 November 1952) is a German conceptual artist. She has made drawings, paintings, sculptures, videos and installations, and has worked in mixed media. From 1985, she made pictures using knitting-machines.

Between 1974 and 1978, she studied anthropology, mathematics, sociology and theology while also studying at the Werkkunstschule of Cologne, at a time when the influence of Joseph Beuys was very strong there.\nIn the early 1980s, Trockel met members of the M\u00fclheimer Freiheit artist group founded by Ji\u0159\u00ed Georg Dokoupil and Walter Dahn, and exhibited at the women-only gallery of Monika Spr\u00fcth in Cologne.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nTrockel's work often criticises the work of other artists, or artistic styles such as minimal art.:\u200a252\u200a In 1985, she began to make large-scale paintings produced on industrial knitting machines. These regularly featured geometric motifs or logos such as the Playboy Bunny or a hammer and sickle, and the trademark: Made in West Germany. During the 1980s, she also worked for the magazine Eau de Cologne, which was focused on the work of women artists.:\u200a252\u200a\nIn 1994, Trockel created the Frankfurter Engel monument for the city of Frankfurt. For Documenta in 1997, she and Carsten H\u00f6ller collaborated on an installation in one of the exhibition's outbuildings. Since the late 1990s, she has worked extensively with clay and has also continued to produce both hand and machine knitted \"paintings\".

He leads the Tokyo-based architectural firm New Material Research Laboratory.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHiroshi Sugimoto was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He reportedly took his earliest photographs in high school, photographing film footage of Audrey Hepburn as it played in a movie theater. In 1970, Sugimoto studied politics and sociology at Rikky\u014d University in Tokyo. In 1974, he retrained as an artist and received his BFA in Fine Arts at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, California. Afterwards, Sugimoto settled in New York City. He soon started working as a dealer of Japanese antiquities in Soho.\n\n\n== Work ==\nSugimoto has spoken of his work as an expression of 'time exposed', or photographs serving as a time capsule for a series of events in time. His work also focuses on transience of life, and the conflict between life and death.\nSugimoto is also deeply influenced by the writings and works of Marcel Duchamp, as well as the Dadaist and Surrealist movements as a whole. He has also expressed a great deal of interest in late 20th century modern architecture.\nHis use of an 8\u00d710 large-format camera and extremely long exposures has garnered Sugimoto a reputation as a photographer of the highest technical ability. He is equally acclaimed for the conceptual and philosophical aspects of his work.\n\n\n=== Dioramas, In Praise of Shadows and Portraits ===\nSugimoto began his work with Dioramas in 1976, a series in which he photographed displays in natural history museums. (A polar bear on a fake ice floe contemplates his fresh-killed seal; vultures fight over carrion in front of painted skies; exotic monkeys hoot in a plastic jungle.) Initially the pictures were shot at the American Museum of Natural History, a place he returned for later dioramas in 1982, 1994, and 2012. Where many of the earlier silver gelatin prints \u2013 including Polar Bear (1976), his first photograph from the Diorama series \u2013 present animals, a number of the 2012 photographs including Mixed Deciduous Forest and Olympic Rain Forest focus on natural landscapes. The cultural assumption that cameras always show us reality tricks many viewers into assuming the animals in the photos are real until they examine the pictures carefully.\nHis series Portraits, begun as a commission by the Deutsche Guggenheim in 1999, is based on a similar idea. In that series, Sugimoto photographs wax figures of Henry VIII and his wives. These wax figures are based on portraits from the 16th century and when taking the picture Sugimoto attempts to recreate the lighting that would have been used by the painter. Focusing on Madame Tussaud's in London, its branch in Amsterdam and a wax museum in Ito, Japan, Sugimoto took three-quarter view photos, using 8-by-10-inch negatives, of the most realistic wax figures. They are typically taken against a black background. In Praise of Shadows (1998) is a series of photographs based on Gerhard Richter's paintings of burning candles.\n\n\n=== Theatres ===\nIn 1978, Sugimoto's Theatres series involved photographing old American movie palaces and drive-ins with a folding 4x5 camera and tripod, opening his camera shutter and exposing the film for the duration of the entire feature-length movie, the film projector providing the sole lighting. The luminescent screen in the centre of the composition, the architectural details and the seats of the theatre are the only subjects that register owing to the long exposure of each photograph, while the unique lighting gives the works a surreal look, as a part of Sugimoto's attempt to reveal time in photography. Sugimoto discovered that \"Different movies give different brightnesses. If it's an optimistic story, I usually end up with a bright screen; if it's a sad story, it's a dark screen. Occult movie? Very dark.\"\n\n\n=== Seascapes ===\nIn 1980 he began working on an ongoing series of photographs of the sea and its horizon, Seascapes, in locations all over the world, using an old-fashioned large-format camera to make exposures of varying duration (up to three hours). The locations range from the English Channel and the Cliffs of Moher to the Arctic Ocean, from Positano, Italy, to the Tasman Sea and from the Norwegian Sea at Vester\u00e5len to the Black Sea at Ozuluce in Turkey. The black-and-white pictures are all exactly the same size, bifurcated exactly in half by the horizon line. The systematic nature of Sugimoto's project recalls the work Sunrise and Sunset at Praiano by Sol LeWitt, in which he photographed sunrises and sunsets over the Tyrrhenian Sea off Praiano, Italy, on the Amalfi Coast.\n\n\n=== Architecture works ===\nIn 1995, Sugimoto photographed the Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d (\"Hall of Thirty-Three Bays\") in Kyoto. In special preparation for the shoot, he had all late-medieval and early-modern embellishments removed, as well as having the contemporary fluorescent lighting turned off. Shot from a high vantage point and editing out all architectural features, the resulting 48 photographs concentrate on the bodhisattvas, 1,000 life-size and almost identical gilded figures carved from wood in the 12th and 13th centuries, that are banked up inside the building.\nIn 1997, on a commission from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, Sugimoto began producing series of large-format photographs of notable buildings around the world. In 2003, the museum showed the series in a sepulchral installation, with the pictures installed on layered rows of dark-painted partitions. Sugimoto's later Architecture series (2000\u201303) consists of blurred images of well-known examples of Modernist architecture.\nIn 2001, Sugimoto traveled the length of Japan, visiting the so-called meisho \"famous sites\" for pines: Miho no Matsubara, Matsushima, Amanohashidate. On the royal palace grounds in Tokyo, Sugimoto photographed a pine landscape, copying a traditional 16th-century Japanese ink-painting style. Listed as Japanese national treasures, the Sh\u014drin-zu by\u014dbu (Pine Forest Screens) (ca. 1590) by Momoyama period (1568 1600) painter Hasegawa T\u014dhaku (1539\u20131610) represent a coming of age in Japanese imaging.\n\n\n=== Joe ===\nIn July 2003 Sugimoto travelled to St. Louis to photograph the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, designed by Tadao Ando whose work he had portrayed various times before. However, his ended up photographing Richard Serra's sculpture Joe (the first in his \"Torqued Spiral\" series), which rests in an outdoor courtyard, at dawn and at dusk for five days. The resulting Joe series was made with short exposure. The blurring effect results from Sugimoto's unconventional use of the flexibility of the large format camera, whereby he sets the distance between the lens and the film to half the focal length, in his words \"twice-infinity\". Sugimoto gave the photographs serial numbers from his Architecture series. Significantly, the hand-developed gelatin-silver photographs are mounted on aluminum panels but are otherwise unframed, unglazed and unlaminated to draw attention to what Sugimoto describes as the \"transformation from the three-dimensional steel source sculpture to the thin layers of what I would call my 'silver sculpture'.\" When the Pulitzer Arts Foundation decided to publish a book about the series, Sugimoto asked Jonathan Safran Foer, whom he had met years earlier, to write a text to accompany the nineteen selected photographs.\nA 2004 series comprises large photographs of antique mathematical and mechanical models, which Sugimoto came across in Tokyo and shot from slightly below. The Mathematical forms \u2013 stereometric models in plaster \u2013 were created in the 19th century to provide students with a visual understanding of complex trigonometric functions. The Mechanical forms \u2013 machine models including gears, pumps and regulators \u2013 are industrial tools used to demonstrate basic movements of modern machinery. Sugimoto began working on this series as a response to The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) by Marcel Duchamp.\nFor the series Stylized Sculpture (2007), Sugimoto selected distinctive garments by celebrated couturiers from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute, shot in chiaroscuro on headless mannequins\u2014from Madeleine Vionnet's precociously modern T-dress and Balenciaga's wasp-waisted billowing ensemble to Yves St Laurent's strict geometric Mondrian shift and Issey Miyake's sail-like slip.\nFor his 2009 series Lightning Fields Sugimoto abandoned the use of the camera, producing photographs using a\n400,000 volt Van de Graaff generator to apply an electrical charge directly onto the film. Instead of placing an object on photo-sensitive paper, then exposing it to light, he produced the image by causing electrical sparks to erupt over the on surface of a 7-by-2.5-foot sheet of film laid on a large metal tabletop. The highly detailed results combine bristling textures and branching sparks into highly evocative images.\n\n\n=== Recent work ===\nIn 2009 U2 selected Sugimoto's Boden Sea, Uttwil (1993) as the cover for their album No Line on the Horizon to be released in March that year. This image had previously been used by sound artists Richard Chartier and Taylor Deupree for their 2006 CD inspired by Sugimoto's \"seascapes\" series. Sugimoto noted it was merely a \"coincidence\" that the image appears on both album covers. In addition, he notes that the agreement with U2 was a \"stone age deal\" or, artist-to-artist. No cash exchanged hands, rather a barter agreement which allows Sugimoto to use the band's song \"No Line on the Horizon\" (partly inspired by the \"Boden Sea\" image) in any future project.\nIn 2009, Sugimoto acquired some rare negatives made by Henry Fox Talbot in the 1840s and retrieved through an intensely fragile process what \"looks remarkably like Plato's shadows in the cave\". The works of Sugimoto's All Five Elements series (2011) consist of optical quality glass with black and white film. On the occasion of Art Basel in 2012, Sugimoto presented Couleurs de l'Ombre, 20 different colorful scarf designs in editions of just seven, all created \u2013 using a new inkjet printing method \u2013 for French fashion label Herm\u00e8s.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nSugimoto is also an accomplished architect. He founded his architecture practice in Tokyo after receiving requests to design structures from restaurants to art museums. Because he does not have an architectural license himself\u2014an official permit would require years of training\u2014he hired three young qualified architects to help him execute his vision. He approaches all of his work from many different perspectives, and architecture is one component that he uses to design the settings for his exhibitions. His recent projects include an architectural commission at Naoshima Contemporary Art Center in Japan, for which Sugimoto designed and built a Shinto shrine. He also gets involved with the performance art occurring beside them. This allows him to frame his works precisely the way he wants to.\nIn 2013, Sugimoto created a sculpture and rock garden for the Sasha Kanetanaka restaurant in Omotesand\u014d, Tokyo. He also designed Stove, a top-tier French restaurant housed in a refurbished wooden house in the Kiyoharu Art Village, Yamanashi Prefecture. The first in a series of temporary artist-designed structures at the Le Stanze del Vetro museum on view during the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2014, a Sugimoto-designed glass teahouse was set over a tiled pool and had the traditional tea ceremony performed for the public in it.\nIn 2011, Sugimoto published an architecture book about the many museums that have shown his work, from the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., to the Fondation Cartier in Paris.\nThe Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden announced that in 2018 Sugimoto would transform the interior of the Gordon Bunshaft-designed building. The plans included a coffee bar and removal of the tint on the windows.\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\nSugimoto designed Point of Infinity, a nearly 70 ft-high stainless steel needle that also acts as a sundial, on top of the Yerba Buena Hilltop Park on Yerba Buena Island.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSugimoto has exhibited extensively in major museums and galleries throughout the world, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (1994), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (1995); Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin (2000); the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria (2002); the Serpentine Gallery, London (2003) and the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, Paris (2004). A major 30-year survey of his work opened at the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo in 2005 and travelled to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C., and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas (2006). In 2007, a European retrospective began at K20 Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf (2007) and traveled to the Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin and Kunstmuseum Luzern, Switzerland. (2008). In 2011, Gagosian Gallery in Paris showed Sugimoto's series Stylized Sculpture alongside Rodin's sculptures The Three Shades (c. 1880), Monument to Victor Hugo (1897), and The Whistler Muse (1908).\nIn 2005, Japan Society, New York, and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Washington, organized a US and Canadian tour of \"Hiroshi Sugimoto: History of History\", an exhibition of artifacts that Sugimoto has collected over the years, particularly from East Asia and Japan, curated by the artist himself (travelled to the Kanazawa 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and the National Museum of Art, Japan). In 2013, Sugimoto exhibited his artwork alongside pieces from his personal collection at the Fondation Pierre Berg\u00e9-Yves Saint Laurent in Paris.\nHis exhibition, \"Lost Human Genetic Archive\", at the Tokyo Photographic Art Museum in 2016, incorporated selected images from Dioramas, Seascapes, Theaters and the Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d series, among others. His exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2018 featured 34 large-scale photographs from Sugimoto's central series.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nSugimoto's work is held in numerous public collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery, London; National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo; Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; MACBA, Barcelona; and Tate Gallery, London.\n\n\n== Odawara Art Foundation ==\nIn 2009, Sugimoto established the Odawara Art Foundation to promote Japanese culture. In 2014, the Japan Society awarded a $6 million grant to the foundation. The money will go to the construction of a multidisciplinary arts complex in Odawara, about 60 miles west of Tokyo. The project is expected to be completed in spring 2016. The project includes an original 15th-century entrance gate, a minimalist exhibition space, a modern Japanese teahouse, and a contemporary Noh theater with a stage that appears to float above the sea. The foundation will produce joint productions with the Japan Society as well as artist-in-residency programs at the new complex. The two institutions will also collaborate on exhibitions and performances.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2001 \u2013 Hasselblad Foundation International Award (Hasselblad Honour).\n2009 \u2013 Japanese Art Association: Praemium Imperiale prize for the 'Painting' category\n2010 \u2013 Medal with Purple Ribbon\n2013 \u2013 Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\n2014 \u2013 Isamu Noguchi Award for Kindred Spirits in Innovation, Global Consciousness and Japanese/American Exchange\n2017:   Centenary Medal, Royal Photographic Society\n\n\n== Books ==\nSeascapes.

Powhida's work is critical and addresses the contemporary art world.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPowhida received his Master of Fine Arts in painting from Hunter College in January, 2002.\n\n\n== Career ==\nTopics have included creating an \"enemies\" list as well as letters addressed to contemporary curators (such as Zach Feuer Gallery), collectors and critics, requesting recognition. His 2009 piece \"Relational Wall\" includes portraits sourced from Artforum's \"Scene & Herd\". He also produces portraits drawn entirely from memory.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nIn 2004, Powhida began compiling lists of enemies, rendering portraits of each enemy in graphite and gouache with insults written beneath each face. Few were spared from these lists, and his father is no exception, who is identified by the word \"failure\" under his portrait. These early works, which were in an exhibition at Platform Gallery as well as galleries in Williamsburg, display the physical evidence of the artist's toil, measured in sweat and coffee stains left on the paper.\nHe followed up his initial enemy lists with a Seattle Enemies List specific to the Pacific Northwest, targeting Tacoma-based artist Dale Chihuly and the Northern spotted owl among others. The 2006 exhibition at Platform gallery debuted a drawing of over 300 small head studies entitled Everyone I've ever Met from Memory (That I Can Remember), which Brooklyn Rail critic James Kalm described as a \"meta-drawing\" demonstrating a level of ambition and commitment to carry out the kind of stoner idea many people have but most would not actually do. The exhibition also included hex drawings of then United States president George W. Bush and New York-based gallerist Zach Feuer and a fictitious Artforum Top 10 penned by himself.\nThe New York magazine blog was featured in a New York magazine front cover, for Powhida's show at the Schroeder Romero Gallery (now Schroeder Romero & Shredder) in 2007. The work from his solo exhibition This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero includes a nine-page handwritten feature that plays on a feature Ariel Levy wrote about Dash Snow for the magazine. By this time he had developed a trompe-l'\u0153il technique, rendering pages from magazines as well as sheets of blue-lined notebook paper as if torn from real-world sources and taped to the wall. These sheets of notebook paper with lists titled \"Proposals\" and \"Reasons\" offer a comically distorted worldview that blurs the lines of fact and fiction in an ego-driven celebrity art culture.\nIn a 2009 drawing called \"Post-Boom Odds\", Powhida placed speculative bets on which young artists will matter in 10 years.\n\n\n=== How The New Museum Committed Suicide With Banality ===\nPowhida produced a drawing called \"How the New Museum Committed Suicide with Banality\" for the November 2009 cover of the Brooklyn Rail. The drawing was released in an edition of 20 prints sold by two galleries that represent Powhida, New York\u2019s Schroeder Romero & Shredder and LA\u2019s Charlie James.\nThe name of the drawing was taken from a post on James Wagner's blog. The work features caricatures of individuals involved in the controversial New Museum exhibition, including Jeff Koons as Howdy Doody, which Edward Winkleman remarked is ironic considering how much Powhida's work owes to Koons. New Museum trustee at the center of the controversy, Dakis Joannou, bought a print of Powhida\u2019s drawing from his New York dealer for $1,500.\nDavid W. Kiehl, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said that drawings like this one, which accused the New Museum of cronyism, expose things that are undercover that people do not want to talk about.\nPowhida later responded to criticism in an article published on the Art:21 blog.\n\n\n=== Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville ===\nAt Charlie James Gallery's booth at the Pulse Art Fair, Powhida unveiled a 40 by 60 inch drawing he and artist Jade Townsend had produced called Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville, depicting an art world shantytown with artists, dealers, critics and curators gathering in food lines. The who's who of the art world are assembled outside the convention center in which Art Basel Miami Beach is held, and which Powhida describes as \"the belly of the beast.\" In the bottom left corner, mega-collectors Marty Marguiles, Don Rubell, Charles Saatchi and Eli Broad place bets on a cockfight with miniature representations of Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons.\nNew York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz described the drawing as \"a great big art world stink bomb\" and a much needed institutional critique. He suggested that a museum commission Powhida to produce a one-year-long project that would result in a fifteen feet high, twenty feet wide drawing of the art world as it is today.\n\n\n=== #class ===\n\n#class was a month-long series of events at Winkleman Gallery in New York that took place between February 20 to March 20, 2010 organized by Powhida and artist Jennifer Dalton. #class invited guest artists, critics, academics, dealers, collectors and anyone else who would like to participate to examine the way art is made and seen in our culture and to identify and propose alternatives and/or reforms to the current market system.\nPowhida has long collaborated with artist Jennifer Dalton, who worked with him to produce art world condolence cards for Art Basel in 2008 and co-directed a hypothetical, post-apocalyptic art gallery for Powhida's exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn his review of Powhida's 2009 exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall, Holland Cotter of the New York Times called Powhida an \"art world vigilante, virtuoso draftsman, compulsive calligrapher and fantasist autobiographer.\" Art critic Jerry Saltz called Powhida the second best thing to happen in 2009 in his assessment of art in New York that year, praising his drawing for the Brooklyn Rail as well as his spring exhibition at Schroeder Romero.\nCritics have drawn comparisons between his art world diatribes and those of 18th and 19th century social critics and satirists William Hogarth, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, Henri Meyer and Paul Iribe. Critics have also pointed out the site-specificity of his practice. For example, his 2009 exhibition at Charlie James Gallery drew on Los Angeles-based professional actors, voice talents, and film studios to produce his video \"Powhida (Trailer)\". Other works have investigated media portrayals of place when setting his works in New York, Seattle and Aspen, Colorado.\nDamien Cave of the New York Times, who has called Powhida the \"gadfly of the art establishment,\" has pointed out that the artist's own rising fame presents a problem for an artist who critiques the art market as feudal and celebrity obsessed. New York dealer-turned Museum of Contemporary Art director Jeffrey Deitch takes a similar stance, saying, \"The irony is that by exposing art celebrity culture, he's becoming a celebrity himself... So hats off to him.\"\nLeah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times has argued that there are two distinct voices in the artist's work, both named William Powhida, Powhida the \"character\" and Powhida the \"author\". In a 2007 interview Powhida hinted at the idea, saying, \"I do a lot of writing, fiction.\"\n\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nIn the press release for This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero, Powhida wrote, \"I can't keep sitting around my studio getting drunk and yelling at my assistants forever.\" He arrived at the opening for that exhibition with a black eye and a cut. After viewing a set of Powhida's drawings about a night of hard drinking and bar fights, art critic James Kalm, taking the drawings at face value, offered the artist some personal advice on sobriety. Other accounts have described a more socially-responsible artist who works as a teacher at a public high-school in Brooklyn.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nIn 2007, Powhida collaborated with Jeff Parker on the book Back of the Line published by Decode. Regina Hackett of the Post-Intelligencer compared his facility to the \"damning exactitude of a police sketch artist.\" During a reading of the book in Seattle, Powhida and Parker attempted to orchestrate an attack on one of his own works.\n\n\n== Quote ==\nPowhida has been quoted on NPR as noting that \"in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christie's in New York.\" He further  commented: \"If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWilliam Powhida's website\nNew York Times Review for ABMB Hooverville\nNew York Times Review for The Writing Is on the Wall\nDavid Joselit's review in Art Forum\nreview by James Kalm in The Brooklyn Rail\n[1] Schroeder Romero press release", "Claude Closky (born 22 May 1963) is a French Contemporary Artist who lives and works in Paris, France.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nClosky won the \"Grand prix des Arts plastiques\" (1999) and the Marcel Duchamp Prize (2005) awarded by the ADIAF.\nDike Blair wrote in Artforum Magazine that \"The lightness of Closky's art belies the depth of its absurdist heredity. Working in a post-modernist mode, Closky's art works combine aspects of the Situationists, Fluxus, Beckett, Tall, Daniel Buren, and Andy Warhol.\"\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nClaude Closky has no formal training as a visual artist. He entered the ENSAD (Ecole National Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs) in 1982, but quit at the end of the first year to co-found The Ripoulin Brothers, a street artist collective, with Bla+Bla+Bla, Nina Childress, Jean Faucheur, Pierre Huyghe, Manhu, Ox, Trois carr\u00e9s. In 1988, he left the group to develop his independent work, using voluntarily poor means such as drawing and printed matter.\nHe has participated in the Biennials of Lyon (1995), Sydney (1996), Taipei (2000), Val\u00e8ncia (2001), Sharjah (2005), Venice (2017). In 2000, the Mudam (Luxembourg Art Museum) commissioned him to conceive and manage its website, for which he made a magazine and a gallery dedicated to the internet. The site was launched at the Luxembourg Pavilion in the 2001, Venice Biennale. It presented specific works by Heath Bunting, Fran\u00e7ois Curlet, Pierre Leguillon, Aleksandra Mir, Peter Kogler, David Shrigley, among others. Since 2005, he has taught at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 2012, he curated This & There, an exhibition to celebrate the tenth year of the Pavilion, Palais de Tokyo Laboratory for Creation (Paris) which presented the work of 74 artists in 74 different spaces. He has curated in 2020 X at the Frac Pays de la Loire and in 2023 Offset at the Centre des livres d'artistes.\n\n\n== Work ==\nThe work of Claude Closky is mainly immaterial. Language is his model to articulate images, text, numbers, and sounds collected in our environment, or made in his studio. Although Closky is reluctant to produce objects and spectacular effects, his work still addresses issues about visibility and space appropriation.\nClaude Closky's projects always find alternative ways to emancipate themselves from the formats imposed by the sites where they are exhibited. He seeks to point out the contradictions of our contemporary society and its representations, but also to question the role of art as producer of a cultural consensus and set of values. His works confront and question our environment, the conditions and benefits of artistic production, its relation to an audience.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClaude Closky offline works\nClaude Closky online works\nText by Lynne Cooke about Closky's commission for the Dia Art Foundation, 1997\nText by Dike Blair about Closky's art pieces for the web, 1999.\nText by Marie Muracciole about Closky's exhibition at Museo Madre, Naples, 2007\nText by Marie Muracciole about Closky's exhibitions Laloli and Rarori, 2010\nSquare One, text by Katy Siegel and Paul Mattick, 2007.", "Gordon Matta-Clark (born Gordon Roberto Matta-Echaurren; June 22, 1943 \u2013 August 27, 1978) was an American artist best known for site-specific artworks he made in the 1970s.  He was also a pioneer in the field of socially engaged food art.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nMatta-Clark's parents were artists: Anne Clark, an American artist, and Roberto Matta, a Chilean Surrealist painter, of Basque, French and Spanish descent. He was the godson of Marcel Duchamp's wife, Teeny. His twin brother Sebastian, also an artist, died by suicide in 1976.\nHe studied architecture at Cornell University from 1962 to 1968, including a year at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he studied French literature. In 1971, he changed his name to Gordon Matta-Clark, adopting his mother's last name. He did not practice as a conventional architect; he worked on what he referred to as \"Anarchitecture\". At the time of Matta-Clark's tenure there, Cornell's architecture program was guided in part by Colin Rowe, a preeminent architectural theorist of modernism.\nMatta-Clark used a number of media to document his work, including film, video, and photography. His work includes performance and recycling pieces, space and texture works, and his \"building cuts\". He also used puns and other word games as a way to re-conceptualize preconditioned roles and relationships (of everything, from people to architecture). \nIn February, 1969, the \"Earth Art\" show, curated by Willoughby Sharp at the invitation of Tom Leavitt, was realized at Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art, Cornell University. Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in \"Earth Art\" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition. Sharp then encouraged Gordon Matta-Clark to move to New York City where Sharp continued to introduce him to members of the New York art world. Matta-Clark's work, Museum, at Klaus Kertess' Bykert Gallery, was listed and illustrated on pages 4\u20135 of Avalanche 1, Fall 1970.\nIn 1971 Matta-Clark, Carol Goodden, and Tina Girouard co-founded FOOD, a restaurant in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood; managed and staffed by artists. The restaurant turned dining into an event with an open kitchen and exotic ingredients that celebrated cooking. The activities at FOOD helped delineate how the art community defined itself in downtown Manhattan. The first of its kind in SoHo, Food became well known among artists and was a central meeting-place for groups such as the Philip Glass Ensemble, Mabou Mines, and the dancers of Grand Union. He ran FOOD until 1973.\nIn the early 1970s and in the context of his artistic community surrounding FOOD, Matta-Clark developed the idea of \"anarchitecture\" - a conflation of the words anarchy and architecture - to suggest an interest in voids, gaps, and left-over spaces. With his project Fake Estates, Matta-Clark addressed these issues of non-sites by purchasing at auction 15 leftover and unusably small slivers of land in Queens and Staten Island, New York, for $25\u2013$75 a plot. He documented them through photographs, maps, bureaucratic records and deeds, and spoke and wrote about them - but was not able to occupy these residual elements of zoning irregularities in any other way.\nIn 1974, he performed a literal deconstruction, by removing the facade of a condemned house along the Love Canal, and moving the resulting walls to Artpark, in his work Bingo.\nFor the Biennale de Paris in 1975, he made the piece titled Conical Intersect by cutting a large cone-shaped hole through two townhouses dating from the 17th century in the market district known as Les Halles which were to be knocked down in order to construct the then-controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.  Also in 1975 he did a similar art intervention named \"Days End, Conical Inversion\" by cutting a round aperture into the structure at Pier 52 on the Hudson River in Manhattan.\nFor his final major project, Circus or The Caribbean Orange (1978), Matta-Clark made circle cuts in the walls and floors of a townhouse next-door to the first Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, building (237 East Ontario Street), thus altering the space entirely.\nFollowing his 1978 project, the MCA presented two retrospectives of Matta-Clark's work, in 1985 and in 2008. The 2008 exhibition You Are the Measure included never-before-displayed archival material of his 1978 Chicago project. You Are the Measure traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nMatta-Clark died from pancreatic cancer on August 27, 1978, aged 35, in New York City. He was survived by his widow, Jane Crawford. The Gordon Matta-Clark Archive is housed at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.\nIn 2019, his 1974 piece Splitting was cited by The New York Times as one of the 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age.\n\n\n== Videography ==\nProgram One: Chinatown Voyeur (1971)\nProgram Two (1971\u20131972)\nTree Dance (1971)\nOpen House (1972)\nProgram Three (1971\u20131975)\nFire Child (1971)\nFresh Kill (1972)\nDay's End (1975)\nFood (1972)\n Program Five (1972\u20131976)\nAutomation House (1972)\nClockshower (1973)\nCity Slivers (1976)\nProgram Four: Sauna View (1973)\nProgram Six (1974\u20131976)\nSplitting (1974)\nBingo/Ninths (1974)\nSubstrait (Underground Dailies) (1976)\nProgram Seven (1974\u20132005)\nConical Intersect\" (1975)\nSous-Sols de Paris (Paris Underground) (1977\u20132005)\nThe Wall (1976\u20132007)\nProgram Eight: Office Baroque (1977\u20132005)\n\n\n== Selected books ==\nOdd Lots: Revisiting Gordon Matta-Clark\u2019s Fake Estates, introduction and interviews by curators Jeffrey Kastner, Sina Najafi, and Frances Richard, Essays by Jeffrey A.

Haacke is considered a \"leading exponent\" of Institutional Critique.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHaacke was born in Cologne, Germany. He studied at the Staatliche Werkakademie in Kassel, Germany, from 1956 to 1960. In 1959, Haacke was hired to assist with the second documenta, working as a guard and tour guide. He was a student of Stanley William Hayter, a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962, he studied on a Fulbright grant at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. From 1967 to 2002, Haacke was a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City.\n\nDuring his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957\u20131966). This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art's metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.\nAlthough their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke's early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.\nThese early installations focused on systems and processes.  Condensation Cube (1963\u201365) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s, his art had found a more specific focus.\n\n\n== Systems work (1970\u2013present) ==\nHaacke's interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems. In most of his work after the late 1960s, Haacke focused on the art world and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; he often underlines its effects in site-specific ways.\nHaacke has been outspoken throughout his career about demystifying the relationship between museums and businesses and their individual practices. He writes, \"what we have here is a real exchange of capital: financial capital on the part of the sponsors and symbolic capital on the part of the sponsored\". Using this concept from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Haacke has underlined the idea that corporate sponsorship of art enhances the sponsoring corporations' public reputation, which is of material use to them.  Haacke believes, moreover, that both parties are aware of this exchange, and as an artist, Haacke is intent on making this relationship clear to viewers.\nIn 1970, Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled Information to be held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue. The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled MoMA Poll, but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, \"Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?\" Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent Plexiglas ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots. Haacke's question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as institutional critique. MoMA Poll was cited in 2019 by The New York Times as one of the works of art that defined the contemporary age.\nIn one of his best-known works, which quickly became an art historical landmark, Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, A Real Time Social System, as of May 1, 1971, Haacke took on the real-estate holdings of one of New York City's biggest slum landlords. The work exposed, through meticulous documentation and photographs, the questionable transactions of Harry Shapolsky's real-estate business between 1951 and 1971. Haacke's solo show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which was to include this work and which made an issue of the business and personal connections of the museum's trustees, was cancelled on the grounds of artistic impropriety by the museum's director six weeks before the opening. (Shapolsky was not such a trustee, although some have misunderstood the affair by assuming that he was.) Curator Edward Fry was consequently fired for his support of the work.\nFollowing the abrupt cancellation of his exhibition and the trouble it had caused with the museum, Haacke turned to other galleries, to Europe and his native country, where his work was more often accepted. Ten years later he included the Shapolsky work\u2014by then widely known\u2014at his solo exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, entitled  \"Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business\".\nAt the John Weber gallery in New York, in 1972, on two separate occasions, Haacke created a sociological study, collecting data from gallery visitors. He requested the visitors fill out a questionnaire with 20 questions ranging from their personal demographic background information to opinions on social and political issues. The results of the questionnaires were translated into pie charts and bar graphs that were presented in the gallery at a later date. They revealed, among other things, that most visitors were related in some way to the professions of art, art teaching, and museology, and most were politically liberal.\nIn 1974, Haacke submitted another proposal that was subsequently rejected for an exhibition at the Wallraf\u2013Richartz Museum in Cologne. The work described a well-documented history of the ownership (with individual biographies of each of the owners) of Manet's painting Bunch of Asparagus in the museum's collection, narrating how it came into the collection, and in which the Third Reich activities of its donor were revealed. Instead, the work was exhibited in the Paul Menz Gallery in Cologne with a color reproduction in place of the original.\nIn 1975, Haacke created a similar piece to the Manet project at the John Weber gallery in New York, exposing the history of ownership of Seurat's Models (Les Poseuses) (small version).  In the same manner as the previous installation, this work showed the increase of the value of the work as it passed from one patron to another.\nAlso In 1975, he created one of his most memorable installations, entitled On Social Grease. The work, which takes its title from a speech by a corporate head of one of the world's major oil companies, is made up of carefully fractured plaques exhibiting quotes from business executives and important art world figures. These plaques display their opinions on the system of exchange between museums and businesses, speaking directly to the importance of the arts in business practices.\nIn 1978, Haacke had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England, that included the new work A Breed Apart, which made explicit criticism of the state-owned British Leyland for exporting vehicles for police and military use to apartheid South Africa.\nHis 1979 solo exhibition at Chicago's Renaissance Society featured paintings that reproduced and altered print ads for Mobil, Allied Chemical, and Tiffany & Co.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nWith extensive research Haacke continued throughout the 1980s to target corporations and museums in his work through larger scale installations and paintings. In 1982, at the documenta 7 exhibition, Haacke exhibited a very large work that included oil portraits of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in 19th-century style, facing on the opposite wall a gigantic photograph of the demonstration against nuclear arms held earlier that year\u2014the largest demonstration in Germany since the end of the Second World War.  The clear implication, supported by Haacke's remarks, was that these two figures were attempting to roll back their respective nations to the socially and politically regressive, laissez-faire, and imperialist policies of the 19th century. In 1988 he was given an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London at which he exhibited the portrait of Margaret Thatcher, full of iconographic references featuring cameos of Maurice and Charles Saatchi. The Saatchis were well known not only as art collectors on an aggressive scale, widely affecting the course of the art world by their choices, but also as the managers of Thatcher's successful, fear-based political campaigns as well as that of the South African premier, P. W. Botha.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nHaacke's controversial 1990 painting Cowboy with Cigarette turned Picasso's Man with a Hat (1912\u201313) into a cigarette advertisement. The work was a reaction to the Phillip Morris company's sponsorship of a 1989\u201390 exhibition about Cubism at the Museum of Modern Art.\nHaacke has had solo exhibitions since, at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.\nIn 1993, Haacke shared, with Nam June Paik, the Golden Lion for the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Haacke's installation Germania made explicit reference to the pavilion's roots in the politics of Nazi Germany.  Haacke tore up the floor of the German pavilion as Hitler once had done. In 1993, looking through the doors of the pavilion, past the broken floor, the viewer witnesses the word on the wall: \"Germania\", Hitler's name for Nazi Berlin.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAt the 2000, Whitney Biennial, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Haacke presented a piece that is a direct reaction to art censorship. The piece called Sanitation featured six anti-art quotes from US political figures on each side of mounted American flags. The quotes were in a Gothic style script typeface once favored by Hitler's Third Reich. On the floor was an excerpt of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression. Lined up against the wall were a dozen garbage cans with speakers emitting military marching sounds. Haacke notes that \"freedom of expression is the focus of the work\".\n\n\n=== Commissions ===\nIn 2000, the permanent installation DER BEV\u00d6LKERUNG (To the Population) was inaugurated in the Reichstag, the German Parliament building in Berlin, and in 2006, a public commission commemorating Rosa Luxemburg was completed in a three-block area in the center of the city. In 2014, it was announced that Haacke would be installing one of his works as part of the annual Fourth Plinth commission in 2015. His winning commission of a bronze sculpture of a horse\u2019s skeleton, titled Gift Horse, comes with an electronic ribbon tied to its front leg that displays a live ticker of prices on the London Stock Exchange.\n\n\n=== Use of Law ===\nAlong with Adrian Piper and Michael Asher, Haacke uses a version of Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projansky's 1971 artist contract, The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement, in order to control the dissemination, display and ownership of his art works.\n\n\n== Writing and publications ==\nOn being considered a political artist Haacke says: \"it is uncomfortable for me to be a politicized artist.... the work of an artist with such a label is in danger of being understood one dimensionally without exception.... all artwork have a political component whether its intended or not\". Jack Burnham comments on Haacke's political growth and links its roots to exposure to a time of political unrest in the US surrounding the Vietnam War. Burnham also points to Haacke's joining the Arts Workers Coalition and the boycott of the S\u00e3o Paulo Bienal in Brazil in 1969 as catalyst for the artist's work to take a political direction. Writing by Haacke and his close friends and colleagues, including documentation of his work, are collected in two separate books by the artist.\nHans Haacke first published a book about the ideas and processes behind his and other conceptual art called Framing and Being Framed. Published in 1995, Free Exchange, is a transcription of a conversation between Haacke and Pierre Bourdieu. The two men met in the 1980s and, as Bourdieu states in the introduction, \"very quickly discovered how much they have in common\".\n\n\n== Notable works in public collections ==\nCondensation Cube (1963), Generali Foundation, Vienna (on permanent loan to Museum der Moderne Salzburg); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; and Tate, London\nBlue Sail (1964-1965), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\nCondensation Wall (1963/1966), National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\nShapolsky et al.

Holland is known for creating a style of art that may use fiberglass (or fibreglass), aluminum (or aluminium), epoxy paint, plywood, beads, oil paint,  palette knives, marble, copper, paper, and clay. For clay he uses watercolor, acrylic urethane, and ceramic glazes.\n\n\n== Background and education ==\nHolland began his formal art education at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was influenced by David Park before traveling to Chile as a Fulbright Grant recipient. Holland's early academic art influence was David Park at Berkeley, but his artistic style continued to develop through his travels and personal experiences.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Contemporary practice ===\nHis beginning as a painter was labeled \"funky\". It wasn't until Holland began to work with aluminum that he achieved critical acclaim. His work has been described as taking inspiration from Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism, and he has been called one of California's most important contemporary artists and was featured in Art in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1945\u20131980: An Illustrated History.\nHolland works primarily with fiberglass and aluminum to create free-standing and wall installations, a style that has been said to encompass Abstract Expressionism (8). He creates his art by riveting metal to the fiberglass or aluminum, then using epoxy paint to add other elements to the piece which add depth, light, and color. His work has been labeled exhilarating and visually challenging, playing games and distorting the three-dimensional space.  Holland is represented by Bivins Gallery in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n=== Collections ===\nAnderson Collection\nBerkeley Art Museum\nBrooklyn Museum\nCharles Schwab Company\nChicago Art Institute\nCleveland Center for Contemporary Art\nDenver Art Museum\nDi Rosa Collections\nDuker Collection\nFederal Reserve Bank, San Francisco\nLos Angeles County Museum*  Mayfield Fund\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\nThe National Gallery of Art\nOakland Museum of California\nThe Official Residence of the United States Ambassador to Switzerland\nPalm Springs Desert Museum\nSan Francisco Art Institute\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art\nThe Santa Barbara Museum of Art Collection\nSeattle Art Museum\nSolomon R.

He holds both American and Swiss nationality.\nMarclay's work explores connections between sound, noise, photography, video and film. A pioneer of using gramophone records and turntables as musical instruments to create sound collages, Marclay is, in the words of critic Thom Jurek, perhaps the \"unwitting inventor of turntablism.\" His own use of turntables and records, beginning in the late 1970s, was developed independently of but roughly parallel to hip hop's use of the instrument.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nChristian Marclay was born on January 11, 1955, in San Rafael, Marin County, California, to a Swiss father and an American mother and raised in Geneva, Switzerland. He studied at the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Art Visuel in Geneva (1975\u20131977), the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston (1977\u20131980, Bachelor of Fine Arts) in the Studio for Interrelated Media Program, and the Cooper Union in New York (1978). As a student he was notably interested in Joseph Beuys and the Fluxus movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Long based in Manhattan, Marclay has in recent years divided his time between New York and London.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nCiting the influence of John Cage, Yoko Ono and Vito Acconci, Marclay has long explored the rituals around making and collecting music. Drawn to the energy of punk rock, he began creating songs, singing to music on pre-recorded backing tapes. Unable to recruit a drummer for his 1979 performances with guitarist Kurt Henry, Marclay used the regular rhythms of a skipping LP record as a percussion instrument. These duos with Henry might be the first time a musician used records and turntables as interactive, improvising musical instruments.\nMarclay sometimes manipulates or damages records to produce continuous loops and skips, and has said he generally prefers inexpensive used records purchased at thrift shops, as opposed to other turntablists who often seek out specific recordings. In 1998, he claimed never to have paid more than US$1 for a record. Marclay has occasionally cut and re-joined different LP records; when played on a turntable, these re-assembled records will combine snippets of different music in quick succession along with clicks or pops from the seams \u2013 typical of noise music \u2013 and when the original LPs were made of differently-colored vinyl, the reassembled LPs can themselves be considered as works of art.\nSome of Marclay's musical pieces are carefully recorded and edited plunderphonics-style; he is also active in free improvisation. He was filmed performing a duo with Erikm for the documentary Scratch. His scene didn't make the final cut, but is included among the DVD extras.\nMarclay released Record Without a Cover on Recycled Records in 1985, \"...designed to be sold without a jacket, not even a sleeve!\" Accumulating dust and fingerprints would enhance the sound. A review in Spin at the time cited Marclay's \"coolest theatrical gesture\" in his live performances of phonoguitar: the artist strapped a record player onto himself and played, for example, a Jimi Hendrix album. In his artwork Five Cubes (1989), he melted vinyl records into cubes. The Sound of Silence (1988) is a black-and-white photograph of the Simon & Garfunkel single of the same title.\nFollowing this turn, Marclay has in more recent years produced visual art, although usually of representations of sound, or the various technologies of representing sound. His Graffiti Composition (2002) posted musical notes on walls around Berlin, compiled photographs of them as they faded, and is performed in concert. During his residency at Eyebeam, Marclay created Screen Play (2005), a twenty minute video of black and white images overlaid with colorful computer graphics. For Performa 05, the first edition of the Performa Biennial, two ensembles and one soloist interpreted Screen Play.\nShuffle (2007) and Ephemera (2009) are also musical scores. In Sound Holes (2007), he photographed the many patterns of speaker holes on intercoms. From 2007-2009 he worked with cyanotype at Graphicstudio to capture the motion of cassette tapes unspooling. And an interest in onomatopoeia dating back to 1989 has culminated in his monumental Manga Scroll (2010), a 60-foot scroll of cartoon interjections that doubles as a musical score.\nIn 2010, he produced The Clock, a 24-hour compilation of time-related scenes from movies that debuted at London's White Cube gallery in 2010. In 2016, he produced Made to Be Destroyed, a compilation of film clips showing the destruction of art works or buildings.\nThom Jurek writes: \"While many intellectuals have made wild pronouncements about Marclay and his art \u2013 and it is art, make no mistake \u2013 writing all sorts of blather about how he strips the adult century bare by his cutting up of vinyl records and pasting them together with parts from other vinyl records, they never seem to mention that these sound collages of his are charming, very human, and quite often intentionally hilarious.\"\nMarclay has performed and recorded both solo and in collaboration with many musicians, including John Zorn, William Hooker, Elliott Sharp, Otomo Yoshihide, Butch Morris, Shelley Hirsch, Flo Kaufmann and Crevice; he has also performed with the group Sonic Youth, and in other projects with Sonic Youth's members.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nSwiss Institute Contemporary Art New York, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2016)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMarclay began dating curator Lydia Yee in 1991, and the couple married in 2011.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nAt the 2011 Venice Biennale, representing the United States of America, Marclay was recognized as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for The Clock. Newsweek responded by naming Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today. Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked Andy Warhol, thanking the jury \"for giving The Clock its fifteen minutes\". In 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Berlin Mix the 17th best work of performance art in history.\nIn 2015, the White Cube presented a major solo exhibition including a range of new work and a lively programme of weekly performances played by the London Sinfonietta and guests, including Thurston Moore and Mica Levi.\n\n\n== Artist books ==\nEphemera, Bruxelles, mfc-mich\u00e8le didier, 2009.

Applebroog was the recipient of multiple honors including the MacArthur Fellowship \"Genius Grant\", the College Art Association Distinguished Art Award for Lifetime Achievement, and an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the New School for Social Research/Parsons School of Design. Applebroog lived in New York City and is represented by Hauser & Wirth.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nIda Applebroog was born as Ida Appelbaum on November 11, 1929, in the Bronx, New York, into an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family. From 1948 to 1950, she attended NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences. At the Institute, she studied graphic design rather than fine art. Applebroog stated that she, \"couldn't make art without also making money.\" While studying at NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, she began to work at an advertising agency where she was the only woman. Applebroog later recounted, \"In those days sexual harassment was a day-to-day event. I held out in the ad agency for six months, then resigned.\"\nAfter resigning from the advertising agency, Applebroog went on to work as a freelance illustrator for children's books and greeting cards. In 1950, she married Gideon Horowitz, her high school sweetheart. She took a job in the art division of the New York Public Library. She also began to take night classes at City College of New York during this time. By 1960, Applebroog had four children and in order for her husband to complete his doctorate, Applebroog and her family had to move to Chicago. After moving to Chicago Applebroog took courses at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and made jewelry in her family's basement that her husband and children would sell at art fairs.\nIn 1968 Applebroog and her family relocated again to Southern California where her husband accepted an academic position. While living in San Diego, California, Applebroog began sketching close-ups of her own naked body, specifically her crotch, while in the bathtub, a series of more than 150 works she would not exhibit until 2010. In 1969 Applebroog was briefly hospitalized for depression, during which time she began making bathtub sketches. She was released by 1970 and promptly began to continue making art in her studio in San Diego. Once she returned from her hospitalization, she began to create sculptures of \"biomorphic forms made from fabric\" amongst much other art. At the age of forty-four she participated in one of her earliest group exhibitions, entitled Invisible/Visible in 1972 at Long Beach Museum of Art.\nThe following year Applebroog went to the Feminist Artists Conference at California Institute of the Arts, where she spoke with many women artists and was highly influenced by their enthusiasm toward social activism in art. Applebroog moved back to New York City in 1974. It was there, after changing her name from \"Ida Horowitz\" to \"Ida Applebroog\" (based on her maiden name, Applebaum), where she began to develop her own signature artistic style with a series of cartoonlike figures that merged the comic-strip format with the advertising industry's use of story-boards to explain a concept.\nStarting in 1977 she circulated a series of self-published books through the mail, and joined Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics, alongside feminist curators and artists such as Lucy R. Lippard and May Stevens, among others. In 1981 she showed Applebroog: Silent Stagings, her first exhibition at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City, where she continued to show for over 20 years. Applebroog stated that the subject of her work is \"how power works--male over female, parents over children, governments over people, doctors over patients.\"\nIn 2005 she was profiled in the PBS documentary Art 21: Art in the Twenty-first Century. In 2010, Applebroog's works on paper, including her 1969 sketches, were exhibited in a solo show entitled Ida Applebroog: Monalisa at Hauser & Wirth in New York City, and in 2011 at Hauser & Wirth in London. In 2016 Applebroog was the subject of the documentary Call Her Applebroog, directed by her daughter Beth B.\nIn 2020, Ida Applebroog's work was included in a major group show at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, Florida. My Body, My Rules, presented an investigation about the diverse artistic practices of 23 female-identified artists in the 21st-century. Louise Bourgeois, Carolee Schneemann, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Ana Mendieta, Wanguechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas, and Francesca Woodman, were also among them.\nIda Applebroog died on October 21, 2023, at the age of 93.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nGalileo Works, 1977, Self Published\nDyspepsia Works, 1979, Self Published\nBlue Books, 1981, Self Published\n\n\n=== Images from exhibitions ===\ndOCUMENTA (13) Images from the exhibition\n\n\n== Select public collections ==\nThe Corcoran Museum of Art\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\nMuseum of Modern Art\nGuggenheim Museum\nWhitney Museum of Art\n\n\n== Awards and grants ==\nArtist's Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1980\nCreative Artists in Public Service Program, New York State Council on the Arts, 1983\nArtist's Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1985\nGuggenheim Fellowship, 1990\nMilton Avery Distinguished Chair, Bard College, 1991\u201392\nLifetime Achievement Award, College Art Association, 1995\nHonorary Doctorate, New School University/Parsons School of Design, 1997\nMacArthur Foundation Fellowship, 1998\nWomen's Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award, 2008\nAnonymous Was A Woman Award, 2009\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nIda Applebroog, \"Ida Applebroog: Monalisa\" (Hardcover) 2010.

He is known for his abstract expressionist ceramic sculptures, which crossed the traditional divide between ceramic crafts and fine art. He established the ceramics department at the Los Angeles County Art Institute and at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nPeter Voulkos was born the third of five children to Greek immigrant parents, Aristovoulos I. Voulkopoulos, anglicized and shortened to Harry (Aris) John Voulkos and Effrosyni (Efrosine) Peter Voulalas.\nAfter high school, he worked as a molder's apprentice at a ship's foundry in Portland. In 1943, Peter Voulkos was drafted into the United States Army during the Second World War, serving as an airplane gunner in the Pacific.\n\n\n=== Ceramics' specialization ===\nVoulkos studied painting and printmaking at Montana State College, in Bozeman (now Montana State University), where he was introduced to ceramics (Frances Senska, who established the ceramics arts program, was his teacher). Ceramics quickly became a passion. His 25 pounds of clay allowed by semester by the school was not enough, so he managed to spot a source of quality clay from the tires of the trucks that would stop by the restaurant where he worked part-time.\nHe earned his MFA in ceramics from California College of the Arts and Crafts, in Oakland. Afterwards, he returned to Bozeman, and began his career in a pottery business with classmate Rudy Autio, producing functional dinnerware.\nIn 1951 Voulkos and Autio became the first resident artists at the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts, in Helena, Montana. It is from his time as Resident Director (1951-1954) that the lineage of his mature work, later in full bloom during his tenure at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, California, can be traced.\nIn 1953, Voulkos was invited to teach a summer session ceramics course at Black Mountain College in Asheville, North Carolina. After the summer at Black Mountain, he changed his approach to creating ceramics. The artist eschewed his traditional training and instead of creating smooth, well-thrown glazed vessels he started to work gesturally with raw clay, frequently marring his work with gashes and punctures.\nIn 1954, after founding the art ceramics department at the Otis College of Art and Design, called the Los Angeles County Art Institute, his work rapidly became abstract and sculptural. In 1959, he presented for the first time his heavy ceramics during the exhibition at the Landau Gallery in Los Angeles. This created a seismic reaction in the ceramics world, both for the grotesquerie of the sculptures' shapes and the genius marriage of arts and craft, and accelerated his transfer to UC Berkeley.\n\n\n=== UC Berkeley's ceramics department ===\nHe moved to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959, where he also founded the ceramics program, which grew into the Department of Design. In the early 1960s, he set up a bronze foundry off-campus, anticipating the metal cast Wurster Hall, and started exhibiting his work at NY's Museum of Modern Art.\nHe became a full professor there in 1967, and continued to teach until 1985. Among his students were many ceramic artists who became well known in their own right.\nIn 1984, Voulkos was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. \nAt a New York auction in 2001, a 1986 sculpture by Peter Voulkos was sold $72,625 to a European museum.\nHe died of a heart attack on February 16, 2002, after conducting a college ceramics workshop at Bowling Green State University, Ohio, demonstrating his skill to a live audience.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Description ===\nWhile his early work was fired in electric and gas kilns, later in his career he primarily fired in the anagama kiln of Peter Callas, who had helped to introduce Japanese wood-firing aesthetics in the United States. Peter Voulkos is also among those who raised ceramics to the non-utilitarian, aesthetic sphere. While setting up the ceramics department at UC Berkeley, his students were authorized to make a teapot, \"only if it didn't work\". Voulkos started this new trend while in Los Angeles in the 1950s, saying, \"there was a certain energy around L.A. at the time\". He is most commonly identified as an Abstract Expressionist ceramist.\nVoulkos's sculptures are known for their visual weight, their freely-formed construction, and their aggressive and energetic decoration. During shaping, he would vigorously tear, pound, and gouge their surfaces. At some points in his career, he cast sculptures in bronze; and in early periods his ceramic works were glazed or painted and/or finished with painted brushstrokes.\nPeter Voulkos is also memorable for the live ceramics-sculpting sessions he would lead in front of his students, demonstrating his intense and even unforgiving manner of working with the material, while simultaneously showcasing his refined mastery of the nuances of the craft. His creativity quest sometimes led to the use of commercial dough-mixing machines to mix the clay, and the development of a prototype for an electric potter's wheel.\nIn 1979 he was introduced to the use of wood firing in anagama kilns by Peter Callas, who became a close collaborator of his for the next 23rs. Most of Voulkos's late work was wood-fired in Callas's anagama, which was located at first in Piermont, New York, and later, in\n\n\n=== Sculptures ===\nBlack Butte Divide or Black Divide - Butte, 1958, fired clay, Norton Simon Museum\nHall of justice, 1971, bronze\nMr. Ishi, 1970, bronze\nUntitled (Stack), 1980, stoneware, exhibited at the Oakland Museum of California\n\n\n== Public collections ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1959: Rodin Museum Prize\n1984: Guggenheim Fellowship\n1997: Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement from the College Art Association\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVoulkos is survived by his first wife, Margaret Cone, and their daughter, Pier, a polymer clay artist; his wife, Ann, and their son, Aris; and his brother and two sisters.\nIn the early 1980s, Peter Voulkos went to rehab to deal with alcohol and cocaine addiction.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican craft\nCeramics (art)\nStudio pottery\nPaul Soldner\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRhodes, Daniel (1959).

Archived from the original on June 1, 2008.", "Brendan Fernandes (born 1979) is a Canadian contemporary artist who examines issues of cultural displacement, migration, labor, queer subjectivity, and collective agency through interdisciplinary performance that uses installation, video, sculpture, and dance. He currently serves as a faculty member at Northwestern University teaching art theory and practice.\nOperating at the intersection of dance and visual art, his projects raise questions about the blending of different media and aim to challenge the concept of a fixed, essential, or authentic identity. His multimedia projects engage with postcolonial and critical theory discourse. Over the course of the past two decades, Fernandes has conducted extensive research and presented performance interventions in both national and international museums, galleries, and cultural institutions. He has also showcased his work in prominent museums in his home city of Chicago.\nIn his current work, Fernandes focuses on the diverse meanings of the body, seeing it as both a culturally significant object and an expressive tool for individuality and identity. He uses choreography to explore movement, particularly in queer and laboring bodies, examining their impact on gender roles and physicality. Additionally, Fernandes' art questions social and political issues, reflecting on life during and after the pandemic and events like Black Lives Matter. He draws upon incidents like the Pulse Orlando massacre and ongoing violence in queer spaces, aiming to challenge power structures and promote inclusivity and equity.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFernandes was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1979. His family, Indians in Kenya of Goan descent, who lived in Africa for five generations, moved to Canada when he was nine years old due to political unrest. Fernandes went to school in Newmarket, Ontario.\n\n\n== Education ==\nFernandes trained professionally as a ballet dancer, but tore his hamstring during his senior year in college, and the injury ended his dance career. He went on to train as a visual artist and completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at York University in Toronto, and then pursued a Master of Fine Arts at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario.  In 2007, he graduated from the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan, New York.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nFernandes was a 2010 Sobey Art Award nominee and awarded the Robert Rauschenberg Fellowship (2014). He has also been the recipient of the 2017 Canada Council New Chapters grant, the Artadia Award (2019), a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship (2020), and a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant (2019).\nHis projects have been presented at venues, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), The Getty Museum (Los Angeles), and the National Gallery of Canada (Ottawa).\n\n\n== Exhibitions and performances ==\nFernandes exhibited a series of sculptures and live performances at The Graham Foundation titled The Master and Form, in 2018. The series explored mastery and discipline within the culture of ballet through the use of designed objects that enable dancers to perfect and extend iconic positions. This work was featured in the 2019 Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nIn 2017 at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles Fernandes presented Free Fall 49, a work that addressed the 2016 massacre at The Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. The performance was a choreography of eight dancers, improvised over two hours of music produced by Tom Krell of How to Dress Well.  Music samples interspersed at abrupt intervals \u2013 reminiscent of the staccato of gunfire, the beat cut into the propulsive music 49 times, cuing the dancers first to hit the ground, then rise in moments of memorial and resurrection. This performance art piece was later presented in the Kogod Courtyward of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in June 2019.\n\nIn 2011, Fernandes was included in Found in Translation, exhibition at The Solomon R Guggenheim Museum, New York.\nOn the occasion of Fernandes'  Noguchi Museum project he has published a book titled Re/Form in 2022.\n\n\n== References ==", "G\u00fcnther F\u00f6rg (December 5, 1952 \u2013 December 5, 2013) was a German painter, graphic designer, sculptor and photographer. His abstract style was influenced by American abstract painting.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nF\u00f6rg was born in F\u00fcssen, Allg\u00e4u. His father, Michael, worked in a customs office. He studied from 1973 until 1979 at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich with Karl Fred Dahmen.  From 1992 until 1999, he taught at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Karlsruhe. From 1999 on he was a professor in Munich. He had a home in Areuse, Switzerland, as well as in Freiburg. In 1993 he married Ika Huber.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nF\u00f6rg's artistic oeuvre encompasses paintings, graphic and sculptural works as well as a great body of architectural photographs. His geometrical, abstract, and heavily dyed pictures have a strong decorative character. F\u00f6rg combined materials and media in painting, sculpture and photography. The themes of his large scale architectural photographs are Bauhaus and fascist aesthetics, while his monochrome wall paintings and lead paintings are reflections on art.\nBetween 1973 (F\u00f6rg's first year as a student at The Academy of Fine Art Munich) and 1976, F\u00f6rg painted almost exclusively black monochrome canvas pictures in acrylic, which, with the addition of a translucent grey, produced a milky, veiled surface effect. After the death of his artistic colleague, Blinky Palermo, F\u00f6rg pursued the latter's European legacy of American Minimal Art from 1977. Palermo has been quoted as saying, in reference to F\u00f6rg, \u201cthe art is near as beautiful as the man\u201d. It is unclear whether this was meant as an insult of compliment. His paintings in abstract styles recall Cy Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly and others.\nIn the early 1980s, F\u00f6rg made his so-called Alubilder \u2013 assemblages of aluminium sheeting onto which the artist had painted linear patterns or portrait photographs. For his series of paintings on lead, dating from the 1980s and 1990s, he wrapped lead sheets over wood, then painted each surface with acrylic.\nF\u00f6rg started using photography in his work at the beginning of the 1980s. In the area of photography he is known for his works from 1980\u20132006, primarily very large formats showing famous architectural sites such as the Wittgenstein House, Casa Malaparte, Casa del Fascio, and Hans Poelzig\u2019s IG Farben Building in Frankfurt. For this purpose he travelled extensively to Spain, Israel, Austria, Russia, France, Turkey and Italy where he primarily photographed Bauhaus buildings. F\u00f6rg's photographic research using a 35 mm camera and zoom lenses presents the uncompromisingly modern architecture in an unembellished way, sometimes dilapidated, often featuring careless renovations or additions. His photographs of buildings with cultural and political significance \u2014 Bauhaus structures in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, for example, or Fascist ones in Italy \u2014 were taken from unusual, sharp-angled perspectives, with off-center framing and often in grainy focus, suggestive of painting. Many of the photographs are views taken through windows that draw attention to transitions from interior to exterior space. The photographs are presented under thick protective glass reflecting the room and the viewer.\nIn 1988, as part of the Sculpture in the City exhibition, F\u00f6rg installed two-metre-long walls of mirrors in a Rotterdam tube station; they were demolished in 1999.\nBeginning in 1992, paintings and works on paper, known and documented in literature as \"Gitterbilder\" (grid paintings), appear in F\u00f6rg's work. The roots for these pieces, however, are to be found in an earlier series, the so-called \"Fenster-Aquarelle\" (window watercolors): the crossbar forms a grid for the space in the image, which provides the frame for a whole flow of paintings without limiting their free display and development.\nIn 1991 for the opening of Frankfurt's Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, F\u00f6rg produced a colorful wall piece for the central stairway, which together with a bronze relief formed a contrast to the architectural structure of the post-modern museum architecture. In 2000, he was commissioned with designs for Swiss Re's Centre for Global Dialogue in Zurich.  For this project Forg handled the color design for all of the interiors in the 1920s Villa Bodmer and installed two enormous tubes of raw metal in its central entrance hall.\nHe died, aged 61, in Colombier, Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nF\u00f6rg had his first solo exhibition at R\u00fcdiger Sch\u00f6ttle Gallery, Munich, in 1980 with a series of monochrome paintings. In 1992, his work could be seen at the documenta IX, followed by an exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 1995. F\u00f6rg has had solo exhibitions at Essl Museum, Klosterneuburg, Austria, Langen Foundation, Neuss, Germany, Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland; Kunsthalle Bremen, Germany; Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Netherlands; Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv, Kunsthaus Bregenz, Bregenz, Austria, Museum der Stadt F\u00fcssen, F\u00fcssen, Germany, and Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nDuring his lifetime, F\u00f6rg\u2019s work was shown by Greene Naftali Gallery in New York; Almine Rech Gallery in New York, London, Paris, and Brussels; and Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin. Since 2018, his estate has been exclusively represented by Hauser & Wirth.\nThe highest selling painting by the artist was Untitled (1990), who wold by \u00a31,331,250 ($1,727,341) at Christie's, on 12 February 2020.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 1996, F\u00f6rg was awarded the Wolfgang Hahn Prize. He is mentioned in the book Art Now, vol. 3 , (Taschen Verlag, 2009) as being amongst the most interesting living contemporary artists. According to Artinvestor Magazine (2009), F\u00f6rg ranked 23rd globally amongst then living artists when several factors are combined, such as collections, auction results and gallery representation.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Public collections ==\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nPinakothek der Moderne, Munich\nLenbachhaus, Munich\nDaimler Contemporary, Berlin\nHamburger Bahnhof - Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwart, Berlin\nSammlung Haubrok, Berlin\nSammlung Hoffmann, Berlin\nKunstmuseum Bonn, Bonn\nKunstsammlungen Chemnitz, Chemnitz\nMKM Museum K\u00fcppersm\u00fchle f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Duisburg\nKunstpalais Erlangen, Erlangen\nKunstsammlung Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main\nMuseum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst (MMK), Frankfurt am Main\nSt\u00e4del, Frankfurt/Main\nZentrum f\u00fcr Kunst und Medientechnologie, Karlsruhe\nMuseum Kurhaus Kleve\nMuseum Ludwig, Cologne\nGalerie f\u00fcr Zeitgen\u00f6ssische Kunst GfZK, Leipzig\nSt\u00e4dtisches Museum Abteiberg, M\u00f6nchengladbach\nKunstraum Gr\u00e4sslin, St. Georgen\nSt\u00e4dtische Galerie Wolfsburg\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nEssl Museum, Klosterneuburg/Vienna\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nAGO, Toronto\nNational Gallery of Canada, Ottawa\n\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nSwiss Re, Zurich\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nTate Modern, London\n\n\n=== United States ===\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL\nMOCA, Los Angeles, CA\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York, NY\nWalker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN\nMildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, Saint Louis, MO\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA\nJ.

With a career spanning nearly four decades, Fabre has established himself as an influential figure in the artistic landscape.\n\n\n== Consilience Artist ==\nJan Fabre often refers to the concept of \u2018Consilience\u2019 \u2013 the unity of knowledge \u2013 a concept that was elaborated by William Whewell (1794\u20131866) and further developed by the American entomologist, biologist and philosopher Edward O. Wilson (1929\u20132021) in his book 1998 Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge.\nFabre describes himself as a consilience artist, explaining: \u2018It\u2019s a merging of elements from different disciplines guided by fact-based theory and practice across disciplines. An understanding of entomology can, for example, lead to new interpretations within the visual arts. Or vice versa \u2013 you see connections (For example across art, theatre, science, religion, medicine), you make new interpretations. This is consilience.'  Fabre identifies with this idea of consilience, taking a multifaceted and far-reaching approach. Thanks to this undertaking, Fabre offers fresh interpretations to the world of visual art, theatre and literature . \n\n\n== Biography and career ==\nIn his visual oeuvre, Fabre has developed a unique and coherent universe; a highly personal visual language with recurring symbols and motifs. Whilst studying in Antwerp at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and the Municipal Institute for Decorative Arts and Crafts, where he \"developed a profound love of beauty and its spiritual power\u201d - Jan Fabre . Curious by nature he became influenced by the manuscripts of entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre (1823-1915), so states he \"became fascinated by the world of insects at a young age\". \nHe wrote his first scripts for theatre between 1976 and 1980 and also did his first solo performances. During his 'money-performances', he burned money and wrote the word 'MONEY' with the ashes. In 1977, he renamed the street where he lived to \"Jan Fabre Street\" and fixed a commemorative plaque \"Here lives and works Jan Fabre\" to the house of his parents, analogous to the commemorative plate on the house of Vincent van Gogh in the same street. In 1978 he made drawings with his own blood during the solo performance 'My body, my blood, my landscape'. From 1980, Fabre began his career as a stage director and stage designer. In 1986 he established the Troubleyn/Jan Fabre theatre company with extensive international operations; its home base is Antwerp, Belgium.\nFabre became known for his Bic-art (ballpoint drawings). In 1980, in 'The Bic-Art Room', he had himself locked up for three days and three nights in a white cube full of objects, drawing with blue \"Bic\" ballpoint pens as an alternative to \"Big\" art. In 1990 he covered an entire building with ballpoint drawings.\nFabre also explored relationships between drawing and sculpture creating sculptures in bronze (among them The man who measures the clouds and Searching for Utopia) and with beetles. He decorated the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Brussels with one million six hundred thousand jewel-scarab wing cases for his work Heaven of Delight. In 2004 he erected Totem, a giant bug stuck on a 70-foot steel needle, on the Ladeuzeplein in Leuven (BE).\nIn September 2016 Fabre made an attempt to not break cyclist Eddy Merckx's 1972 hour record at the T\u00eate d'Or Velodrome in Lyon. Fabre completed a total of 23 km in an hour, compared to Merckx's record of over 49 km. Merckx, fellow cyclist Raymond Poulidor, and veteran cycling commentator Daniel Mangeas commentated the event, which was performed as the opening of his \"Stigmata\" retrospective exhibition organised by the Mus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Lyon. Fabre described the attempt as \"how to remain a dwarf in the land of giants\".\n\n\n== Conviction ==\nIn September 2018, twenty former members of Fabre's performing arts company, Troubleyn/Jan Fabre (Antwerp, Belgium) accused him of sexual harassment, abuse of power, and assault. These accusations strongly diminished Fabre's standing in the artistic community.\nOn 28 June 2021, Belgiums' Labour Auditor, acting in his capacity as prosecutor since the alleged offenses were committed in the workplace, indicted Fabre on charges of violence at work and sexual harassment.\nOn Friday 29 April 2022 Jan Fabre was sentenced by a Belgian court to 18 months (without imprisonment) for 5 \"violations of the law on the welfare of workers\" and, in the case of a woman, of \u201cassault on decency\u201d  (i.e. assault for a kiss 'with the tongue' ). While Jan Fabre won't appeal his conviction, 175 former employees and colleagues have sided with the artist/theatre-maker and spoken out about the incorrect portrayal of Fabre as a 'racist, violent molester.'\n\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nOn 26 October 2012, several media outlets reported on a shoot in the Antwerp town hall for a forthcoming film exploring Jan Fabre\u2019s artistic practice, living cats were thrown into the air, after which they made a landing on the steps of the entrance hall (which was covered in a protective layer). The owner of the cats and vet was present during the filming. Later that day, Fabre claimed all cats were still in good health.\nThen in February 2016, Jan Fabre was appointed by the Greek Ministry of Culture as the Creative Director of the annual Athens \u2013 Epidaurus Festival. He resigned less than two months later, on 2 April 2016, after controversy over his plan to turn Greece's major arts festival into \"a tribute to Belgium\" and devote eight of the festival's ten productions to those from his homeland.\nIn October 2016, the Russian State Hermitage museum staged a Fabre exhibition which drew a lot of criticism from visitors and institutions such as the Russian Orthodox Church. Stuffed animals in strange poses sparked outcry among Russian social media network users who launched a campaign under the hashtag #\u043f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u044d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0443, or \"Shame on you, Hermitage\". The museum then organized an event to meet the public and explain the exhibition. The artist confirmed that the animals used were taken from roads where they had been killed and denied any accusations by critics of cruelty.\n\u201cThe animals featured in this installation were found near Antwerp, because many people in Belgium, Holland and France buy dogs and then abandon them on the street during the summer and so they are killed. This installation is essentially a kind of a homage to these animals...I think this exhibition also talks about the power and the force and the vulnerability of humankind and animals.\u201d \u2013 Jan Fabre \n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe Angel of Metamorphosis exhibition, Louvre Museum (2008)\nGlass and Bone Sculptures 1977 \u2013 2017, L\u2019Abbazia di San Gregorio, Venice (cat.)

Her mother was Jewish and her father was from a Protestant background. Her older brother, Charles, later became an associate professor of electronic art.\nWoodman took her first self-portrait at age thirteen and continued photographing herself until she died. She attended public school in Boulder, Colorado, between 1963 and 1971, except for second grade, which she attended in Italy, where the family spent many summers between school years. She began high school in 1972 at Abbot Academy, a private Massachusetts boarding school. There, she began to develop her photographic skills and became interested in the art form. Abbot Academy merged with Phillips Academy in 1973; Woodman graduated from the public Boulder High School in 1975. Through 1975, she spent summers with her family in Italy in the Florentine countryside, where the family lived on an old farm.\nBeginning in 1975, Woodman attended the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in Providence, Rhode Island. She studied in Rome between 1977 and 1978 in a RISD honors program. Because she spoke fluent Italian, she was able to befriend Italian intellectuals and artists. She returned to Rhode Island in late 1978 to graduate from RISD.\nWoodman moved to New York City in 1979. After spending the summer of 1979 in Stanwood, Washington visiting her boyfriend at Pilchuck Glass School, she returned to New York \"to make a career in photography.\" She sent portfolios of her work to fashion photographers, but \"her solicitations did not lead anywhere\". In the summer of 1980, she was an artist-in-residence at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire.\nIn late 1980, Woodman became depressed owing to the failure of her work to attract attention and because of a broken relationship. She survived a suicide attempt in the autumn of 1980, after which she lived with her parents in Manhattan.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn January 19, 1981, Woodman died by suicide at age 22 by jumping out of a loft window of a building on the East Side of New York City. An acquaintance wrote, \"Things had been bad, there had been therapy, things had gotten better, guard had been let down\". Her father has suggested that Woodman's suicide was related to an unsuccessful application for funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. A lackluster response to her photography and a failed relationship had pushed her into the deep depression.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Photographs, 1972\u20131980 ===\nAlthough Woodman used different cameras and film formats during her career, most of her photographs were taken with medium format cameras producing 2+1\u20444 by 2+1\u20444-inch (6x6 cm) square negatives. Woodman created at least 10,000 negatives, which her parents kept. Woodman's estate, which was managed by Woodman's parents, consists of over 800 prints, of which only around 120 images had been published or exhibited as of 2006. Most of Woodman's prints are 8 by 10 inches (20 by 25 cm) or smaller, which \"works to produce an intimate experience between viewer and photograph\".\nMany of Woodman's images are untitled and are known only by a location and date. She often took photographs indoors, finding abandoned and derelict spaces in which to create her photographic tableaux.\n\n\n=== Videos, 1975\u20131978 ===\nAt RISD, Woodman borrowed a video camera and VTR and created videotapes related to her photographs in which she \"methodically whitewashes her own naked body, for instance, or compares her torso to images of classical statuary.\" Some of these videos were displayed at the Helsinki City Art Museum in Finland and the Cisneros Fontanals Art Foundation in Miami in 2005; the Tate Modern in London in 2007\u20132008; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2011.\n\n\n=== Some Disordered Interior Geometries (1981 book) ===\nWoodman created a number of artist's books, such as Portrait of a Reputation, Quaderno dei Dettati e dei Temi (Notebook of Dictations and Compositions), Quaderno (also known as Quaderno Raffaello), Portraits Friends Equasions,  and Angels, Calendar Notebook. However, the only artist's book containing Woodman's photographs that was published during her lifetime was Some Disordered Interior Geometries.  Released in January 1981 shortly before Woodman's death, it is 24 pages in length and is based upon selected pages from an Italian geometry exercise book.  On the pages, Woodman had attached 16 photographs and had added handwriting and white correction fluid. A study of the book notes that Woodman occasionally re-drew a form \"for emphasis or delight.\"  A reproduction of the book's original spreads shows purple-pink covers, pages which vary slightly in color, and traces of pink on several pages. Although the published version of the book has purple-pink covers, the interior pages are printed using only black, white, and shades of gray.\nIn 1999, a critic was of the opinion that Some Disordered Interior Geometries was \"a distinctively bizarre book\u2026 a seemingly deranged miasma of mathematical formulae, photographs of herself and scrawled, snaking, handwritten notes.\" An acquaintance of Woodman wrote in 2000 that it \"was a very peculiar little book indeed,\" with \"a strangely ironic distance between the soft intimacy of the bodies in the photographs and the angularity of the geometric rules that covered the pages.\"  A 2006 essay described the book as \"a three-way game that plays the text and illustrations for an introduction to Euclid against Woodman's own text and diagrams, as well as the 'geometry' of her formal compositions,\" while a 2008 article found the book \"poetic and humorous, analytical and reflexive.\"  A 2010 article on Woodman called the book \"original and enigmatic,\" and a 2010 review stated of the book that \"we are the richer for it.\" Claire Raymond argues that in Some Disordered Interior Geometries Woodman elliptically confronts the problem of the female artist's struggle to claim authority as an artist: by using a student textbook as her signal artist's book (the only book published during Woodman's lifetime) Woodman exposes the difficulty of the female artist moving beyond the role of neophyte/student.\n\n\n== Posthumous recognition ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nBesides catalogues of her solo exhibitions, notable books by and about Woodman include:\n\n\n==== Books of work by Woodman ====\nFrancesca Woodman: Photographs 1975-1980. Marian Goodman, 2004. Exhibition catalogue.\nFrancesca Woodman. Phaidon, 2006. Edited by Chris Townsend.\nFrancesca Woodman's Notebook, which was released in 2011. It contains a facsimile of an Italian school exercise book to which Woodman added photographs, as well as an afterword by Woodman's father. This book, also known as Quaderno or Quaderno Raffaello, has been described as \"both an urgent missive to a lover and a playful sexual summons.\"\nOn Being an Angel Moderna Museet/K\u00f6nig, 2015.\nAlternate Stories.

Woodman's diazotypes and other later works are examined.\n\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nWoodman had only a few exhibitions during her life, some of which have been described as \"exhibitions in alternative spaces in New York and Rome.\" There were no known group or solo exhibitions of her work between 1981 and 1985, but numerous exhibitions each year since then. Among her major solo exhibitions were:\n1978: Immagini. Libreria Maldoror, Roma. \n1986\u20131988: Francesca Woodman, photographic work.

The director \"had unrestricted access to all of Francesca\u2019s photographs, private diaries, and experimental videos\". Although the film won \"Best New York Documentary\" at the Tribeca Film Festival, Woodman's parents decided not to attend the premiere. Reactions to the film have been largely favorable. On the film review site Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 17 critics' reviews were positive, and 83% of 793 user ratings were positive.  It was broadcast on the PBS series Independent Lens on December 22, 2011.\n\n\n=== Popular opinion ===\nPublic opinion has generally been favorable towards Woodman's work.  At the 1998 exhibition in Paris, many people had \"strong reactions\" to her \"interesting\" photographs. A number of people have found Woodman's individual photos (for example \"Self-portrait at 13\") or her photography in general inspirational.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nAmong other factors, critics and historians have written that Woodman was influenced by the following literary genre, myth, artistic movement, and photographers:\n\nGothic fiction.  She is reported to have identified with Victorian heroines. Many of the stories feature a female figure who is often forced into solitude, then turns mad. The Gothic style is full of symbols of tombs, mirrors, demons and angels.\nThe myth of Apollo and Daphne, as evidenced by photographs in which Woodman is entangled in tree roots or wears birch bark on her arms.\nSurrealism. She studied surrealism immensely and studied the workings of Duane Michals.  For example, Woodman \"followed the movement's tradition of not explaining work\" and demonstrated a \"desire to crack the code of appearances.\"\nAndr\u00e9 Breton and in particular his Nadja of 1928. In a 1979 interview with Roberta Valtorta, Woodman is reported as saying \"Vorrei che le parole avessero con le mie immagini lo stesso rapporto che le fotografie hanno con il testo in Nadja di Andr\u00e9 Breton\" (\"I would like words to have the same relationship with my images as the photographs have with the text in Nadja by Andr\u00e9 Breton\". Translated by Dunhill.)\nMan Ray (e.g., a series of his photographs of Meret Oppenheim, and his surrealist works).\nDuane Michals. Woodman's and Michals's work share features such as blurring, angels, and handwriting in common.\nDeborah Turbeville.  Woodman had \"admired\" Turbeville's work, and had compiled an artist's book for Turbeville (Quaderno Raffaello) which contained a written request for the older photographer to telephone her.\nWoodman was exposed to the symbolic work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977 to 1978 and his influence can clearly be seen in many photographic series\u2019, such as Eel Series, Roma (1977\u201378) and Angel Series, Roma (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman's photographs create extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject.\nWoodman worked closely with her friend George Lange, another alumnus from Rhode Island School of Design. During a major exhibition held in honor of Woodman at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver Director Nora Burnett stated \u201c[They] made photographs together, they shared meals together, they experimented, explored and created together.\" A critic noted that this exhibition leaves out mention of her suicide. Instead of highlighting that event, which can dominate the discussion around her art output, this exhibition focuses on her early work, including playful and even ordinary moments from her life.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nConley, Katharine.

Her work often explores LGBT subcultures, moments of intimacy, the HIV/AIDS crisis, and the opioid epidemic. Her most notable work is The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986). The monograph documents the post-Stonewall, gay subculture and includes Goldin's family and friends. She is a founding member of the advocacy group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now). She lives and works in New York City.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGoldin was born in Washington, D.C. in 1953 to middle-class Jewish parents, and grew up in the Boston suburb of Swampscott, moving to Lexington in her teens. Goldin's father worked in broadcasting and served as the chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission. Goldin had early exposure to tense family relationships, sexuality, and suicide, as her parents often argued about Goldin's older sister Barbara who ultimately died by suicide when Goldin was 11:This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early sixties, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behavior, beyond control. By the time she was eighteen, she saw that her only way to get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will.Goldin began to smoke marijuana and date an older man. She left home by age 13 or 14 and subsequently lived in various foster homes. At 16 she enrolled at the Satya Community School in Lincoln, MA. A Satya staff member (existential psychologist Rollo May's daughter) introduced Goldin to the camera in 1969 when she was sixteen years old. Still struggling from her sister's death, Goldin used the camera and photography to cherish her relationships with those she photographed. She also found the camera as a useful political tool, to inform the public about important issues silenced in America. Her early influences included Andy Warhol's early films, Federico Fellini, Jack Smith, French and Italian Vogue, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nGoldin's first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city's gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend David Armstrong. While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin \"fell in with the drag queens,\" living with them and photographing them. Among her work from this period is Ivy wearing a fall, Boston (1973). Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, \"My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can re-create themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it's brave\".\nGoldin admitted to being romantically in love with a queen during this period of her life in a Q&A with Bomb \"I remember going through a psychology book trying to find something about it when I was nineteen. There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so ... I don't know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that's where I was at that time in my life\".\nGoldin describes her life as having been completely immersed in that of the queens. \"I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did \u2013 that's who I was all the time. And that's who I wanted to be\". However, upon attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, when her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with Cibachrome prints. Her work from this period is associated with the Boston School of Photography.\nFollowing graduation, Goldin moved to New York City. She began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene, along with the city's vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her slideshow The Ballad of Sexual Dependency\u2014a title taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Later published as a book with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these snapshot aesthetic images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. In her foreword to the book she describes it as a \"diary [she] lets people read\" of people she referred to as her \"tribe\". Part of Ballad was driven by the need to remember her extended family. Photography was a way for her to hold onto her friends, she hoped.\nThe photographs show a transition through Goldin's travels and her life. Most of her Ballad subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to drug overdose or AIDS; this tally included close friends and often-photographed subjects Greer Lankton and Cookie Mueller. In 2003, The New York Times nodded to the work's impact, explaining Goldin had \"forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years.\" In addition to Ballad, she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: I'll Be Your Mirror and All By Myself.\nGoldin's work is most often presented in the form of a slideshow, and has been shown at film festivals; her most famous being a 45-minute show in which 800 pictures are displayed. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. In the book Auto-Focus, her photographs are described as a way to \"learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her\". The book speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling and references one of Goldin's photographs \"Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984\" as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life.\nGoldin's work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: collaborative book projects with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki; New York City skylines; uncanny landscapes (notably of people in water); her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life.\nIn 2000, her hand was injured and she currently retains less ability to turn it than in the past.\n\nIn 2006, her exhibition, Chasing a Ghost, opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation Sisters, Saints, & Sybils. The work involved her sister Barbara's suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films.\nAfter some time, her photos moved from portrayals of dangerous youthful abandonment to scenes of parenthood and family life in progressively worldwide settings. Goldin currently resides and works in New York, Paris, as well as London.\n\n\n== Fashion ==\nGoldin has undertaken commercial fashion photography\u2014for Australian label Scanlan & Theodore's Spring/Summer 2010 campaign, shot with model Erin Wasson; for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta's Spring/Summer 2010 campaign with models Sean O'Pry and Anya Kazakova, evoking memories of her Ballad of Sexual Dependency; for shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2011 with model Linda Vojtova; and for Dior in 2013, 1000 LIVES, featuring Robert Pattinson.\nIn March 2018, clothing brand Supreme released a collaborative range with Goldin as part of their Spring/Summer 2018 collection. This consisted of jackets, sweatshirts and t-shirts in various colors, with designs titled \"Misty and Jimmy Paulette\", \"Kim in Rhinestone\" and \"Nan as a dominatrix\".\n\n\n== Activism ==\n\nIn 2017, in a speech in Brazil, Goldin revealed she was recovering from opioid addiction, specifically to OxyContin, after being prescribed the drug after wrist surgery. She had sought treatment for her addiction and battled through rehab. This led to her setting up a campaign called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (P.A.I.N.) pursuing social media activism directed against the Sackler family for their involvement in Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of OxyContin. Goldin has said the campaign attempts to contrast the philanthropic contributions of the Sackler family to art galleries, museums and universities with a lack of responsibility taken for the opioid crisis. Goldin became aware of the Sackler family in 2017.\nIn 2018, she organized a protest in the Sackler Wing's Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The protest called for museums and other cultural institutions not to accept money from the Sackler family.\n\nAlso in 2018, she was one of several artists who participated in a $100 sale organized by Magnum Photos and Aperture to raise funds for Goldin's opioid awareness group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now).\"I've started a group called P.A.I.N. to address the opioid crisis. We are a group of artists, activists and addicts that believe in direct action. We target the Sackler family, who manufactured and pushed OxyContin, through the museums and universities that carry their name. We speak for the 250,000 bodies that no longer can.\"In February 2019, Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim Museum in New York over its acceptance of funding by the Sackler family.\nShe also said that she would withdraw from a retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Portrait Gallery in London if they did not turn down a gift of \u00a31 million from the Sacklers. The gallery subsequently said it would not proceed with the donation.\nTwo days after the National Portrait Gallery statement, the Tate group of British art galleries (Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool) announced it would no longer accept any gifts offered by members of the Sackler family, from whom it had received \u00a34m. Tate Modern had been planning to display its copy of Goldin's The Ballad of Sexual Dependency slideshow, for a year from April 15, 2019. Goldin had not discussed the show with Tate.\nGoldin identified that Tate, which has received Sackler money, paid her for one of the ten copies of The Ballad of Sexual Dependency in 2015, when she was deeply addicted to OxyContin. She says she spent some of the money on buying black market OxyContin, as doctors would no longer prescribe her the drug.\nIn July 2019, Goldin and others from the group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a protest in the fountain at the Louvre in Paris. The protest was to try to persuade the museum to change the name of its Sackler wing, which is made up of 12 rooms.\nIn November 2019, Goldin campaigned at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\nSome critics have accused Goldin of making heroin use appear glamorous and of pioneering a grunge style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as The Face and I-D. However, in a 2002 interview with The Observer, Goldin herself called the use of \"heroin chic\" to sell clothes and perfumes \"reprehensible and evil.\" Goldin admits to having a romanticized image of drug culture at a young age, but she soon saw the error in this ideal: \"I had a totally romantic notion of being a junkie. I wanted to be one.\" Goldin's substance usage stopped after she became intrigued with the idea of memory in her work, \"When people talk about the immediacy in my work, that's what its about: this need to remember and record every single thing\"\nGoldin's interest in drugs stemmed from a sort of rebellion against parental guidance that parallels her decision to run away from home at a young age, \"I wanted to get high from a really early age. I wanted to be a junkie. That's what intrigues me. Part was the Velvet Underground and the Beats and all that stuff. But, really, I wanted to be as different from my mother as I could and define myself as far as possible from the suburban life I was brought up in.\"\nGoldin denies the role of voyeur; she is instead a queer insider sharing the same experiences as her subjects: \"I'm not crashing; this is my party. This is my family, my history.\" She insists her subjects have veto power over what she exhibits. In Fantastic Tales Liz Kotz criticizes Goldin's claim that she is just as much a part of what she is photographing rather than exploiting her subjects. Goldin's insistence on intimacy between artist and subject is an attempt to relegitimize the codes and conventions of social documentary, presumably by ridding them of their problematic enmeshment with the histories of social surveillance and coercion, says Kotz. [Her] insider status does nothing to alter the way her pictures convert her audience into voyeurs.\nGoldin's The Ballad of Sexual Dependency critiques gender norms (\"clich\u00e9s\" as she calls them) by highlighting the collective human desire to form connections regardless of the emotional or physical cost. Throughout Ballad, Goldin showcases some difficult moments for both herself and her friends, especially in relation to their codependency in search of genuine connection. Her friends are a diverse cast consisting of many non-conforming gender identities and sexualities; Goldin's photography exposes many narratives that most would turn a blind eye to, such as the  intense intimacy and pain of same-sex relationships. The AIDS epidemic cost most of Goldin's friends their lives, now preserved in time through the photos that she captured of them. Throughout this period of loss, the desire for connection was further perpetuated and Goldin and her remaining friend group found it essential to remain in close contact with one another. This constant desire for intimacy and connection highlights the similarities amongst people, despite their more obvious differences, emphasizing the societally upheld \"differences\" between men and women.\nIn November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, hundreds of members and supporters of Jewish Voice for Peace\u2013New York City (JVP-NYC) took part in a sit-in protest in front of New York's Statue of Liberty demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Goldin addressed the demonstration, saying, \"As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us.\" Goldin also canceled a photo shoot with the New York Times Magazine due to concerns about the New York Times' reporting on the Gaza crisis, accusing the newspaper of complicity with Israel in its reporting and further questioning its handling of Palestinian perspectives.\n\n\n=== Censorship ===\nAn exhibition of Goldin's work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature. The main reason was that some of the photographs contained children in bed with their parents, who are naked and caressing each other. In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography.\nThe sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin's work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nAugust Sander, Peter Hujar, Larry Clark, David Wojnarowicz, and Claude Cahun are all major influences to Goldin's work. \n\n\n=== Diane Arbus ===\nBoth Goldin and Diane Arbus celebrate those who live marginal lives. Stills from Variety are compared to Arbus' magazine work; the Variety series portray \"the rich collision of music, club life, and art production of the Lower East Side pre and post AIDS period\". Both artists ask to reexamine artists' intentionality. \n\n\n=== Michelangelo Antonioni ===\nOne of the reasons Goldin began photographing was Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up (1966). The sexuality and glamour of the film exerted a \"huge effect\" on her. Referring to images shown in Ballad, \"the beaten down and beaten up personages, with their gritty, disheveled miens, which populate these early pictures, often photographed in the dark and dank, ramshackle interiors, relate physically and emotionally to the alienated and marginal character types that attracted Antonioni.\"\n\n\n=== Larry Clark ===\nThe youths in Larry Clark's Tulsa (1971) presented a striking contrast to any wholesome, down-home stereotype of the heartland that captured the collective American imagination. He turned the camera on himself and his lowlife amphetamine-shooting board of hanger-ons. Goldin would adopt Clark's approach to image-making.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Books by Goldin ===\nThe Ballad of Sexual Dependency. New York: Aperture, 1986.

Artists represented included David Armstrong, Tom Chesley, Dorit Cypis, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Jane Dickson, Darrel Ellis, Allen Frame, Peter Hujar, Greer Lankton, Siobhan Liddel, Mark Morrisroe, James Nares, Perico Pastor, Margo Pelletier, Clarence Elie-Rivera, Vittorio Scarpati, Jo Shane, Kiki Smith, Janet Stein, Stephen Tashjian, Shellburne Thurber, Ken Tisa, and David Wojnarowicz. Goldin noted that artists' works varied in response, as \"out of loss comes memory pieces, tributes to friends and lovers who have died; out of anger comes explorations of the political cause and effects of the disease.\"\nDavid Wojnarowicz's essay \"Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell\" in the exhibition's catalogue criticized conservative legislation that Wojnarowicz believed would increase the spread of HIV by discouraging safe sex education. Additionally, Wojnarowicz speaks about the efficacy of making the private public via the model of outing, as he and Goldin believed empowerment begins through self-disclosure. Embracing personal identities then becomes a political statement that disrupts oppressive rules of behavior of bourgeois society \u2013 though Wojnarowicz does admit outing may lock a subject into a single frozen identity. Goldin's show, and in particular Wojnarowicz's essay, was met with criticism, leading to the National Endowment of Arts rescinding its support for the publication.\n\n\n=== From Desire: A Queer Diary ===\nGoldin's second curated show, From Desire: A Queer Diary (March 29 \u2013 April 19, 1991), was held at the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery at St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY. Artists who were exhibited included David Armstrong, Eve Ashcraft, Kathryn Clark, Joyce Culver, Zoe Leonard, Simon Leung, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Windrum, and David Wojnarowicz.\n\n\n=== Nan's Guests ===\nRencontres d'Arles festival, Arles, France. This included the work of thirteen photographers including Antoine d'Agata, David Armstrong, JH Engstr\u00f6m, Jim Goldberg, Leigh Ledare, Boris Mikhailov, Anders Petersen and Annelies Strba.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNan Goldin on Instagram\nNan Goldin at theCollectiveShift", "Damien Steven Hirst (; n\u00e9\nBrennan; born 7 June 1965) is an English artist and art collector. He is one of the Young British Artists (YBAs) who dominated the art scene in the UK during the 1990s. He is reportedly the United Kingdom's richest living artist, with his wealth estimated at US$384 million in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List. During the 1990s his career was closely linked with the collector Charles Saatchi, but increasing frictions came to a head in 2003 and the relationship ended.\nDeath is a central theme in Hirst's works. He became famous for a series of artworks in which dead animals (including a shark, a sheep, and a cow) are preserved, sometimes having been dissected, in formaldehyde. The best-known of these was The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, a 14-foot (4.3 m) tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde in a clear display case. \nIn September 2008, Hirst made an unprecedented move for a living artist by selling a complete show, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, at Sotheby's by auction and bypassing his long-standing galleries. The auction raised \u00a3111 million ($198 million), breaking the record for a one-artist auction as well as Hirst's own record with \u00a310.3 million for The Golden Calf, an animal with 18-carat gold horns and hooves, preserved in formaldehyde.\nSince 1999, Hirst's works have been challenged and contested as plagiarised 16 times. In one instance, after his sculpture Hymn was found to be closely based on a child's toy, legal proceedings led to an out-of-court settlement.\n\n\n== Early life and training ==\nHirst was born Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol and grew up in Leeds with his Irish mother who worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau. He never met his father; his mother married his stepfather when Hirst was two, and the couple divorced 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic.\nHis mother stated that she lost control of her son when he was young; he was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker to turn it into a fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, \"If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop\". She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.\nHis art teacher at Allerton Grange School \"pleaded\" for Hirst to be allowed to enter the sixth form, where he took two A-levels, achieving an \"E\" grade in art. He was refused admission to Jacob Kramer College when he first applied, but attended the art school after a subsequent successful application to the Foundation Diploma course.\nHe went to an exhibition of work by Francis Davison, staged by Julian Spalding at the Hayward Gallery in 1983. Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, \"blew me away\", and which he modelled his own work on for the next two years.\nHe worked for two years on London building sites, then studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College (1986\u201389), although again he was refused a place the first time he applied. In 2007, Hirst was quoted as saying of An Oak Tree by Goldsmiths' senior tutor, Michael Craig-Martin: \"That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture. I still can't get it out of my head.\" While a student, Hirst had a placement at a mortuary, an experience that influenced his later themes and materials. While an art student, Hirst was an assistant at Anthony d'Offay's gallery.\n\n\n== Early career\u2014student and warehouse shows ==\n\nIn July 1988, in his second year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main organiser of an independent student exhibition, Freeze, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's Docklands. He gained sponsorship for this event from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst's own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint. After graduating, Hirst was included in New Contemporaries show and in a group show at Kettle's Yard gallery in Cambridge. Seeking a gallery dealer, he first approached Karsten Schubert, but was turned down.\nHirst, along with his friend Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising \"warehouse\" shows in 1990, Modern Medicine and Gambler, in a Bermondsey former Peek Freans biscuit factory they designated \"Building One\". Saatchi arrived at the second show in a green Rolls-Royce and, according to Freedman, stood open-mouthed with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst's first major \"animal\" installation, A Thousand Years, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow's head. They also staged Michael Landy's Market. At this time, Hirst said, \"I can't wait to get into a position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say 'f off'. But after a while you can get away with things.\"\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== 1987\u20131990 ===\n1987 \u2013 Damien Hirst and Holden Rowan, Old Court Gallery, Windsor Arts Centre, Windsor, UK \u2013 Curator Derek Culley\n1988 \u2013 Damien Hirst: Constructions and Sculpture, Old Court Gallery, Windsor, UK -Curator Derek Culley\n1988 \u2013 Freeze, Surrey Docks, London, UK\n1989 \u2013 New Contemporaries, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, UK\n1990 \u2013 Modern Medicine, Building One, London, UK\n1990 \u2013 Gambler, Building One, London, UK\n1990 \u2013 Building One, Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery, Paris, FR\n\n\n=== 1991\u20131994 ===\nHis first solo exhibition, organised by Tamara Chodzko \u2013 Dial, In and Out of Love, was held in an unused shop on Woodstock Street in central London in 1991; already in 1989 he had been part of a group exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Emmanuel Perrotin Gallery in Paris. The Serpentine Gallery presented the first survey of the new generation of artists with the exhibition Broken English, in part curated by Hirst. In 1991 Hirst met the up-and-coming art dealer, Jay Jopling, who then represented him.\nIn 1991, Charles Saatchi had offered to fund whatever artwork Hirst wanted to make, and the result was showcased in 1992 in the first Young British Artists exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London. Hirst's work was titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for \u00a350,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost \u00a36,000. The exhibition also included In a Thousand Years. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year's Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey.\nHirst's first major international presentation was in the Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, Mother and Child Divided, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited in a series of separate vitrines. He curated the show Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited Away from the Flock (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work Black Sheep. He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of \u00a31,000. When a photograph of Away from the Flock was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now, the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on Black Sheep.\n\n\n=== 1995\u20131999 ===\nIn 1995, Hirst won the Turner Prize. New York public health officials banned Two Fucking and Two Watching featuring a rotting cow and bull, because of fears of \"vomiting among the visitors\". There were solo shows in Seoul, London and Salzburg. He directed the video for the song \"Country House\" for the band Blur. No Sense of Absolute Corruption, his first solo show in the Gagosian Gallery in New York was staged the following year. In London the short film, Hanging Around, was shown\u2014written and directed by Hirst and starring Eddie Izzard. In 1997 the Sensation exhibition opened at the Royal Academy in London. A Thousand Years and other works by Hirst were included, but the main controversy occurred over other artists' works. It was nevertheless seen as the formal acceptance of the YBAs into the establishment.\nIn 1997, his autobiography and art book, I Want To Spend the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now, was published. With Alex James of the band Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song Vindaloo, followed up by Jerusalem with the London Gay Men's Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was to be used to calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on Mars. He turned down the British Council's invitation to be the UK's representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale because \"it didn't feel right\". He threatened to sue British Airways claiming a breach of copyright over an advert design with coloured spots for its low budget airline, Go.\n\n\n=== 2000\u20132004 ===\nIn 2000, Hirst's sculpture Hymn (which Saatchi had bought for a reported \u00a31m) was given pole position at the show Ant Noises (an anagram of \"sensation\") in the Saatchi Gallery. Hirst was then sued himself for breach of copyright over this sculpture (see Appropriation below). Hirst sold three more copies of his sculpture for similar amounts to the first. In September 2000, in New York, Larry Gagosian held the Hirst show, Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings. 100,000 people visited the show in 12 weeks and all the work was sold.\nOn 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online:\n\nThe thing about 9/11 is that it's kind of like an artwork in its own right. It was wicked, but it was devised in this way for this kind of impact. It was devised visually... You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've achieved something which nobody would have ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing.\nThe next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd:\n\nI apologise unreservedly for any upset I have caused, particularly to the families of the victims of the events on that terrible day.\nIn 2002, Hirst gave up smoking and drinking after his wife Maia had complained and \"had to move out because I was so horrible\". He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer died of a heart attack. This had a profound effect on Hirst, who said, \"It was the first time I felt mortal\". He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians.\nIn April 2003, the Saatchi Gallery opened at new premises in County Hall, London, with a show that included a Hirst retrospective. This brought a developing strain in his relationship with Saatchi to a head (one source of contention had been who was most responsible for boosting their mutual profile). Hirst disassociated himself from the retrospective to the extent of not including it in his CV. He was angry that a Mini car that he had decorated for charity with his trademark spots was being exhibited as a serious artwork. The show also scuppered a prospective Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern. He said Saatchi was \"childish\" and \"I'm not Charles Saatchi's barrel-organ monkey ... He only recognises art with his wallet ... he believes he can affect art values with buying power, and he still believes he can do it.\"\nIn September 2003, he had an exhibition Romance in the Age of Uncertainty at Jay Jopling's White Cube gallery in London, which made him a reported \u00a311m, bringing his wealth to over \u00a335m. It was reported that a sculpture, Charity, had been sold for \u00a31.5m to a Korean, Kim Chang-Il, who intended to exhibit it in his department store's gallery in Seoul. The 22-foot (6.7m), 6-ton sculpture was based on the 1960s Spastic Society's model, which is of a girl in leg irons holding a collecting box. In Hirst's version the collecting box is shown broken open and is empty.\nCharity was exhibited in the centre of Hoxton Square, in front of White Cube. Inside the gallery downstairs were 12 vitrines representing Jesus's disciples, each case containing mostly gruesome, often blood-stained, items relevant to the particular disciple. At the end was an empty vitrine, representing Christ. Upstairs were four small glass cases, each containing a cow's head stuck with scissors and knives. It has been described as an \"extraordinarily spiritual experience\" in the tradition of Catholic imagery. At this time Hirst bought back 12 works from Saatchi (a third of Saatchi's holdings of Hirst's early works), through Jay Jopling, reportedly for more than \u00a38 million. Hirst had sold these pieces to Saatchi in the early 1990s for rather less, his first installations costing under \u00a310,000.\nOn 24 May 2004, a fire in the Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including 17 of Hirst's, although the sculpture Charity survived, as it was outside in the builder's yard. That July, Hirst said of Saatchi, \"I respect Charles. There's not really a feud. If I see him, we speak, but we were never really drinking buddies.\"\nHirst designed a cover image for the Band Aid 20 charity single featuring the \"Grim Reaper\" in late 2004, and image showing an African child perched on his knee. This design was not to the liking of the record company executives, and was replaced by reindeer in the snow standing next to a child.\nIn December 2004, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was sold by Saatchi to American collector Steve Cohen, for $8 million, in a deal negotiated by Hirst's New York agent, Gagosian. Cohen, a Greenwich hedge fund manager, then donated the work to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sir Nicholas Serota had wanted to acquire it for the Tate Gallery, and Hugo Swire, Shadow Minister for the Arts, tabled a question to ask if the government would ensure it stayed in the country.\n\n\n=== 2005\u20132009 ===\nHirst exhibited 30 paintings at the Gagosian Gallery in New York in March 2005. These had taken 3\u00bd years to complete. They were closely based on photos, mostly by assistants (who were rotated between paintings) but with a final finish by Hirst. Also in 2005, Hirst founded the art book publisher Other Criteria.\nIn February 2006, he opened a major show in Mexico, at the Hilario Galguera Gallery, called The Death of God, Towards a Better Understanding of Life without God aboard The Ship of Fools, an exhibition that attracted considerable media coverage as Hirst's first show in Latin America. In June that year, he exhibited alongside the work of Francis Bacon (Triptychs) at the Gagosian Gallery, Britannia Street, London, an exhibition that included the vitrine, A Thousand Years (1990), and four triptychs: paintings, medicine cabinets and a new formaldehyde work entitled The Tranquility of Solitude (For George Dyer), influenced by Bacon.\n\nA Thousand Years (1990) contains an actual life cycle. Maggots hatch inside a white minimal box, turn into flies, then feed on a bloody, severed cow's head on the floor of a claustrophobic glass vitrine. Above, hatched flies buzz around in the closed space. Many meet a violent end in an insect-o-cutor; others survive to continue the cycle. A Thousand Years was admired by Bacon, who in a letter to a friend a month before he died, wrote about the experience of seeing the work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Margarita Coppack notes that \"It is as if Bacon, a painter with no direct heir in that medium, was handing the baton on to a new generation.\" Hirst has openly acknowledged his debt to Bacon, absorbing the painter's visceral images and obsessions early on and giving them concrete existence in sculptural form with works like A Thousand Years.\nHirst gained the world record for the most expensive work of art by a living artist\u2014his Lullaby Spring in June 2007, when a 3-metre-wide steel cabinet with 6,136 pills sold for 19.2 million dollars to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar.\nIn June 2007, Beyond Belief, an exhibition of Hirst's new work, opened at the White Cube gallery in London. The centre-piece, a Memento Mori titled For the Love of God, was a human skull recreated in platinum and adorned with 8,601 diamonds weighing a total of 1,106.18 carats. Approximately \u00a315,000,000 worth of diamonds were used. It was modelled on an 18th-century skull, but the only surviving human part of the original is the teeth. The asking price for For the Love of God was \u00a350,000,000 ($100 million or 75 million euros). It didn't sell outright, and on 30 August 2008 was sold to a consortium that included Hirst himself and his gallery White Cube.\nIn November 2008, the skull was exhibited at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam next to an exhibition of paintings from the museum collection selected by Hirst. Wim Pijbes, the museum director, said of the exhibition, \"It boosts our image. Of course, we do the Old Masters but we are not a 'yesterday institution'. It's for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way.\"\nIn December 2008, Hirst contacted the Design and Artists Copyright Society (DACS) demanding action be taken over works containing images of his skull sculpture For the Love of God made by a 16-year-old graffiti artist, Cartrain, and sold on the internet gallery 100artworks.com. On the advice of his gallery, Cartrain handed over the artworks to DACS and forfeited the \u00a3200 he had made; he said, \"I met Christian Zimmermann [from DACS] who told me Hirst personally ordered action on the matter.\" In June 2009, copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry compared the two images and said, \"This is fairly non-contentious legally. Ask yourself, what portion of the original\u2013and not just the quantity but also the quality\u2013appears in the new work? If a 'substantial portion' of the 'original' appears in the new work, then that's all you need for copyright infringement... Quantitatively about 80% of the skull is in the second image.\"\nIn April \u2013 September 2009, the exhibition Requiem took place in the Victor Pinchuk art centre.\nIn October 2009, Hirst revealed that he had been painting with his own hand in a style influenced by Francis Bacon for several years. His show of these paintings, No Love Lost, was at the Wallace Collection in London.\n\n\n=== 2010\u20132014 ===\nIn 2011, Damien Hirst designed the cover of the Red Hot Chili Peppers album I'm with You.\n\nHirst's representation of the British Union Flag formed the arena centrepiece for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. In January 2013, Hirst became the third British artist to design the Brit Awards statue using his signature NEO-Pop art style inspired by his 2000 LSD \"spot painting.\" In October 2014, Hirst exhibited big scale capsules, pills and medicines at the Paul Stolper Gallery titled: 'Schizophrenogenesis'.\n\n\n=== 2015\u2013present ===\nIn April 2016, a study published in Analytical Methods claimed Hirst's preserved carcasses leaked formaldehyde gas above legal limits at Tate Modern; however, this study was shown to be flawed.\nIn 2017, he organised with Pinault Foundation a solo exhibition, in Venice contemporarily to the Biennale in two places in the city: Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana. The title is Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable, purporting to present ancient treasures from a sunken Greek ship, with pieces that range from Ancient Egyptian-alike items to Disney character reproductions, encrusted with shells and corals.\nIn July 2021 through January 2022, Hirst's series Cherry Blossoms was exhibited at the Foundation Cartier in Paris. The exhibition was then moved to the National Art Center in Tokyo in 2022. The show marked Hirst's first major solo exhibition in Japan.\n\n\n=== The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living ===\n\nThis artwork features a large tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate sections. The work was created in 1991, and since then, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal's body, which shows signs of decay. Hirst says that the formaldehyde surrounding the shark is the process of death and decay.\nSome critics argue that the minimalistic qualities of the work, coinciding with the 'stereotypical' death theme, are too bland for such a prestigious artist. One critic wrote, \"But the famous shark, shackled to its coffeebar-existentialist title \u2013 The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living \u2013 seems ever more dilapidated, more fairground sideshow, with every dowdy showing. What clich\u00e9d menace it may once have theoretically possessed has evaporated.\"  Another art critic, Luke White, disagrees, saying that others had earlier perceived sharks \"...as ugly and dangerous, but by the end of the century, they found them instead exhilarating, fascinating, and sublime.\" White argues that sharks have been seen as transcendent, awe-inspiring creatures throughout centuries, a creature that is the embodiment of sublimitude as well as a metaphorical representation of our mind helps, relaying the importance of how special our thoughts really are.\n\n\n=== Beautiful Inside My Head Forever ===\n\nBeautiful Inside My Head Forever was a two-day auction of Hirst's new work at Sotheby's, London, taking place on 15 and 16 September 2008. It was unusual as he bypassed galleries and sold directly to the public. Writing in The Independent, Cahal Milmo said that the idea of the auction was conceived by Hirst's business advisor of 13 years, Frank Dunphy, who had to overcome Hirst's initial reluctance about the idea. Hirst eventually defended the concept and refuted the accusation that he was only interested in making money.People always worry that money somehow tarnishes art, but I always thought it was disgusting that people like Van Gogh never made any money. It's important to make sure that the art takes precedence over the money. Most people worry that somehow you lose your integrity. Frank said to me a long time ago: \"Always have to make sure that you use the money to chase the art and not the art to chase the money.\" And I think that's true; you have to look at that very carefully.\nThe sale raised \u00a3111 million ($198 million) for 218 items. The auction exceeded expectations, and was ten times higher than the existing Sotheby's record for a single artist sale, occurring as the financial markets plunged. The Sunday Times said that Hirst's business colleagues had \"propped up\" the sale prices, making purchases or bids which totalled over half of the \u00a370.5 million spent on the first sale day: Harry Blain of the Haunch of Venison gallery said that bids were entered on behalf of clients wishing to acquire the work.\n\n\n== Hirst art collecting ==\nIn November 2006, Hirst was curator of In the darkest hour there may be light, shown at the Serpentine Gallery, London, the first public exhibition of (a small part of) his own collection. Now known as the 'murderme collection', this significant accumulation of works spans several generations of international artists, from well-known figures such as Francis Bacon, Jeff Koons, Tracey Emin, Richard Prince, Banksy and Andy Warhol, to British painters such as John Bellany, John Hoyland, and Gary Hume, and artists in earlier stages of their careers Rachel Howard, David Choe, Ross Minoru Laing, Nicholas Lumb, Tom Ormond, and Dan Baldwin.\nHirst is currently restoring the Grade I listed Toddington Manor, near Cheltenham, where he intends to eventually house the complete collection. In 2007, Hirst donated the 1991 sculptures \"The Acquired Inability to Escape\" and \"Life Without You\" and the 2002 work \"Who is Afraid of the Dark?\" (fly painting), and an exhibition copy from 2007 of \"Mother and Child Divided\" to Tate from his own personal collection of works.\nIn 2010, Hirst was among the unsuccessful bidders to take over the Magazine Building, a 19th-century structure in Kensington Gardens, which reopened in 2013 as the Serpentine Sackler Gallery after its conversion by Zaha Hadid. In March 2012, he outlined his plans to open a gallery in Vauxhall, London specifically designed to exhibit his personal collection, which includes five pieces by Francis Bacon. The Newport Street Gallery opened in October 2015. It is located in a former theater carpentry and scenery production workshops redesigned by Peter St John and Adam Caruso, and runs the length of Newport Street in Vauxhall.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nHirst was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1992, for his first Young British Artists exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London, which included his The Physical Impossibility of Death..., with the award going to Grenville Davey that year.\nHirst won the Turner Prize in 1995. He was asked to represent the UK in the Venice Biennale in 1999 or to become a Royal Academian but refused.\nIn 2012, Hirst was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his album cover for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\n\n\n== Critical responses ==\n\n\n=== Positive ===\nHirst has been praised in recognition of his celebrity and the way this has galvanised interest in the arts, raising the profile of British art and helping to (re)create the image of \"Cool Britannia.\" In the mid-1990s, the then-Heritage Secretary, Virginia Bottomley recognised him as \"a pioneer of the British art movement\", and even sheep farmers were pleased he had raised increased interest in British lamb. Janet Street-Porter praised his originality, which had brought art to new audiences and was the \"art-world equivalent of the Oasis concerts at Earl's Court\".\nAndres Serrano is also known for shocking work and understands that contemporary fame does not necessarily equate to lasting fame, but backs Hirst: \"Damien is very clever ... First you get the attention ... Whether or not it will stand the test of time, I don't know, but I think it will.\" Sir Nicholas Serota commented, \"Damien is something of a showman ... It is very difficult to be an artist when there is huge public and media attention. Because Damien Hirst has been built up as a very important figure, there are plenty of sceptics ready to put the knife in.\"\nTracey Emin said: \"There is no comparison between him and me; he developed a whole new way of making art and he's clearly in a league of his own. It would be like making comparisons with Warhol.\" Despite Hirst's insults to him, Saatchi remains a staunch supporter, labelling Hirst a genius, and stating:\n\nGeneral art books dated 2105 will be as brutal about editing the late 20th century as they are about almost all other centuries. Every artist other than Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Damien Hirst will be a footnote.\nHirst was among the names in Blake Gopnik's 2011 list \"The 10 Most Important Artists of Today\", with Gopnik interpreting Hirst's career as \"a metaphor for how consumption has become our guiding force\".\n\n\n=== Negative ===\nThere has been equally vehement opposition to Hirst's work. Of Hirst's work, the former Evening Standard art critic, Brian Sewell, expressed the following: \"I don't think of it as art ... It is no more interesting than a stuffed pike over a pub door. Indeed there may well be more art in a stuffed pike than a dead sheep.\"\nThe Stuckist art group was founded in 1999 with a specific anti-Britart agenda by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish; Hirst is one of their main targets. They wrote (referring to a Channel 4 programme on Hirst):\n\nThe fact that Hirst's work does mirror society is not its strength but its weakness \u2013 and the reason it is guaranteed to decline artistically (and financially) as current social modes become outmoded. What Hirst has insightfully observed of his spin-paintings in Life and Death and Damien Hirst is the only comment that needs to be made of his entire oeuvre: \"They're bright and they're zany \u2013 but there's fuck all there at the end of the day.\" \n\nIn 2003, under the title A Dead Shark Isn't Art, the Stuckism International Gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display two years before Hirst's by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. Thomson asked, \"If Hirst's shark is recognised as great art, then how come Eddie's, which was on exhibition for two years beforehand, isn't? Do we perhaps have here an undiscovered artist of genius, who got there first, or is it that a dead shark isn't art at all?\" The Stuckists suggested that Hirst may have got the idea for his work from Saunders' shop display.\nIn a 2008 Channel 4 documentary called The Mona Lisa Curse, art critic Robert Hughes claimed that Hirst's work was \"tacky\" and \"absurd\". Hughes said it was \"a little miracle\" that the value of \u00a35 million was put on Hirst's Virgin Mother (a 35-foot bronze statue), which was made by someone \"with so little facility\". Hughes called Hirst's shark in formaldehyde \"the world's most over-rated marine organism\" and attacked the artist for \"functioning like a commercial brand\", making the case that Hirst and his work proved that financial value was now the only meaning that remained for art.\nHirst's 2009 show, No Love Lost, of paintings by his own hand, at the Wallace Collection in London, received \"one of the most unanimously negative responses to any exhibition in living memory\". Tom Lubbock of The Independent called Hirst's work derivative, weak and boring: \"Hirst, as a painter, is at about the level of a not-very-promising, first-year art student.\" Rachel Campbell-Johnston of The Times said it was \"shockingly bad\". A 2012 exhibition of paintings by Hirst at the White Cube gallery in Bermondsey, entitled \"Two Weeks One Summer\", provoked in The Guardian the comment that Hirst \"can kid himself he is an Old Master and have the art world go along with the fantasy\".\n\nJulian Spalding, British art critic and author of the book Con Art \u2013 Why You Should Sell Your Damien Hirsts While You Can, has said,It's often been proposed, seriously, that Damien Hirst is a greater artist than Michelangelo because he had the idea for a shark in a tank whereas Michelangelo didn't have the idea for his David \u2026 [but] The emperor has nothing on. When the penny drops that these are not art, it's all going to collapse. Hirst should not be in the Tate. He's not an artist. What separates Michelangelo from Hirst is that Michelangelo was an artist and Hirst isn't.\nHirst's 2012 retrospective at the Tate Gallery, while setting records for attendance, also received many complaints. \"Members of the public wrote to the state-funded gallery accusing it of wasting taxpayers' money by showcasing art that was 'repetitive', 'meaningless' and 'almost universally awful'.\"\nHirst's work has also been a frequent subject of criticism in the tabloid press. A Daily Mail headline read: \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all.\" Norman Tebbit, commenting on the Sensation exhibition, wrote \"Have they gone stark raving mad? The works of the 'artist' are lumps of dead animals. There are thousands of young artists who didn't get a look in, presumably because their work was too attractive to sane people. Modern art experts never learn.\"\n\n\n== Backdating claims ==\nIn March 2024, The Guardian reported that four of Hirst's formaldehyde animal works, which were dated to the 1990s by Hirst's company Science Ltd., were actually made in 2017. The four works in question were made by preserving in formaldehyde a dove, two sharks, and two calves. In response, Science Ltd. claimed that the dates the artist had assigned to these works did not represent the dates they were made, but rather the dates they were conceived.\nIn May 2024, The Guardian revealed that at least 1,000 paintings of colorful dots on A4 paper, which were part of an art project called The Currency, that Hirst had repeatedly claimed were \"made in 2016\" and that had the year '2016' inscribed on them along with Hirst's signature were in fact created several years later than claimed. In response, lawyers for Hirst and Science Ltd. did not dispute that at least 1,000 of the paintings dated from 2016 were created years later, but argued that it was Hirst's \u201cusual practice\u201d to date works from a conceptual art project with the date of the project's conception. \n\n\n== Appropriation and plagiarism claims ==\nIn 1999, chef Marco Pierre White said Hirst's Butterflies on Mars had plagiarised his own work, Rising Sun, which he then put on display in the restaurant Quo Vadis in place of Hirst's work.\nIn 2000, Hirst was sued for breach of copyright over his sculpture, Hymn, which was a 20-foot (6.1 m), six ton, enlargement of his son Connor's 14\" Young Scientist Anatomy Set, designed by Norman Emms, 10,000 of which are sold a year by Hull-based toy manufacturer Humbrol for \u00a314.99 each. Hirst paid an undisclosed sum to two charities, Children Nationwide and the Toy Trust, in an out-of-court settlement, as well as a \"good will payment\" to Emms. The charitable donation was less than Emms had hoped for. Hirst also agreed to restrictions on further reproductions of his sculpture.\nIn 2006, a graphic artist and former research associate at the Royal College of Art, Robert Dixon, author of 'Mathographics', alleged that Hirst's print Valium had \"unmistakable similarities\" to one of his own designs. Hirst's manager contested this by explaining the origin of Hirst's piece was from a book The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry (1991)\u2014not realising this was one place where Dixon's design had been published.\n\nIn 2007, artist John LeKay, a friend of Damien Hirst between 1992 and 1994, was reported by Dalya Alberge of The Times to have provided ideas and inspirations for a variety of his later works, including having given him a \"marked-up duplicate copy\" of a Carolina Biological Supply Company catalogue that LeKay had been using as inspiration and supply for his work, noting that \"You have no idea how much he got from this catalogue. The Cow Divided is on page 647\u2014it is a model of a cow divided down the centre, like his piece\", a reference to Hirst's work Mother and Child, Divided, a cow and calf cut in half and placed in formaldehyde. LeKay also suggests that Hirst copied the idea of For the Love of God from his work on crystal skulls in 1993, saying, \"I would like Damien to acknowledge that 'John really did inspire the skull and influenced my work a lot.'\" Copyright lawyer Paul Tackaberry reviewed images of LeKay's and Hirst's work and saw no basis for any appropriation rising to the legal level of a copyright infringement.\nIn 2010, in 3:AM Magazine and in The Jackdaw, Charles Thomson argued that there are 15 cases where Hirst plagiarised the work of others, including his enlarged version of an anatomical torso model, Hymn (1999) which Thomson presents alongside a comparable John LeKay's anatomical torso model from Carolina Science, Yin and Yang (1990), and Hirst's In Nomine Patris [In the Name of the Father] (2005), which presents a split-open crucified sheep in a tank of formaldehyde, after John LeKay's comparably posed split-open crucified sheep, entitled This is My Body, This is My Blood (1987) mounted on a wooden board. Other examples cited were the similarity of Hirst's cabinets with shelves and bottles, e.g., My Way (1991), which expanded to become his room-size installation, Pharmacy (1992), which Thomson relates to a Joseph Cornell display of cabinet with shelves and bottles, Pharmacy (1943); and Hirst's appropriation of concept from Lori Precious, who had made stained-glass window effects from butterfly wings from 1994, a number of years before Hirst. The art gallery lemon sky: projects + editions exhibited a selection of these works by Precious at the Year 06 Contemporary Art Fair in London in October 2006, where these pieces were viewed by a large audience and would have been seen at that time, to have credibly been plagiarized. Thomson also suggested that Hirst's spin paintings and installation of a ball on a jet of air were not original, since similar pieces had been made in the 1960s. A spokesperson for Hirst said the article was \"poor journalism\" and that Hirst would be making a \"comprehensive\" rebuttal of the claims.\nIn May 2017 Hirst was accused of copying and appropriating Yoruba art from Il\u00e9-If\u1eb9\u0300 in his work Golden Heads (Female), which is on display in his exhibition \"Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable\" at the Venice Biennale. The work, said critics, was not given appropriate context for viewers.\nCommenting on his collection, Hirst has said \"As a human being, as you go through life, you just do collect. It was that sort of entropic collecting that I found myself interested in, just amassing stuff while you're alive.\"\nIn 2022 artist and writer Joe Machine accused Hirst of plagiarism of his cherry blossom paintings, the 16th accusation of plagiarism against Hirst.\n\n\n== Hirst business ventures ==\n\n\n=== Work philosophy ===\nAlthough Hirst participated physically in the making of early works, he has always needed assistants\u2014for instance, Carl Freedman helped with the first vitrines\u2014and the current volume of work produced necessitates a \"factory\" setup. this has led to questions about authenticity, as was highlighted in 1997, when a spin painting that Hirst said was a \"forgery\" appeared at sale, although he had previously said that he often had nothing to do with the creation of these pieces.\n\nHirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, \"I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it\"; he described his efforts as \"shite\"\u2014\"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel. She's brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant. The best spot painting you can have by me is one painted by Rachel.\" He also describes another painting assistant who was leaving and asked for one of the paintings. Hirst told her to, \"'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, I want one of yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'\" By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist:Art goes on in your head... If you said something interesting, that might be a title for a work of art and I'd write it down. Art comes from everywhere. It's your response to your surroundings. There are on-going ideas I've been working out for years, like how to make a rainbow in a gallery. I've always got a massive list of titles, of ideas for shows, and of works without titles.\nHirst is also known to volunteer repair work on his projects after a client has made a purchase. For example, this service was offered in the case of the suspended shark purchased by Steven A. Cohen.\n\n\n=== Restaurant ventures ===\nHirst had a short-lived partnership with chef Marco Pierre White in the restaurant \"Quo Vadis\". His best-known restaurant involvement was Pharmacy, located in Notting Hill, London, which closed in 2004. Although one of the owners, Hirst had only leased his art work to the restaurant, so he was able to retrieve and sell it at a Sotheby's auction, earning over \u00a311 million. Some of the work had been adapted, e.g. by signing it prior to the auction.\nHirst is a co-owner of the seafood restaurant, 11 The Quay, in the English seaside town of Ilfracombe. In 2016, Damien Hirst designed the interiors of his new restaurant Pharmacy 2 at the Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall, London.\n\n\n=== Net worth ===\nArt by Hirst sold at his auction in 2008, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, raised US$198 million It is said to be the largest amount raised by any living artist to date. Hirst is reputed to be the richest living artist to date. In 2009, the annually collated chart of the wealthiest individuals in Britain and Ireland, Sunday Times Rich List, placed Hirst at joint number 238 with a net worth of \u00a3235m. Hirst's wealth was valued at \u00a3215m in the 2010 Sunday Times Rich List, making him Britain's wealthiest artist.\n\n\n== Works published, shown, sold ==\n\n\n=== Written ===\n\nHirst, Damien (2014).

Retrieved 22 February 2017.\n\n\n=== Art ===\nHis works include:\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBetween 1992 and 2012, Hirst lived with his American girlfriend, Maia Norman, with whom he has three sons, born 1995, 2000 and 2005.\nSince becoming a father, Hirst has spent most of his time at his remote farmhouse near Combe Martin in Devon. Hirst and Norman were never married, although Hirst had referred to Norman as his \"common-law wife\".\nHirst has admitted serious drug and alcohol problems during a ten-year period from the early 1990s: \"I started taking cocaine and drink... I turned into a babbling fucking wreck.\" During this time he was known for his wild behaviour and eccentric acts including, for example, putting a cigarette in the end of his penis in front of journalists.\nHe is a friend of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and 7-time World Snooker Champion Ronnie O'Sullivan.\n\n\n=== Charitable work ===\nHirst is a supporter of the indigenous rights organisation, Survival International. In September 2008, Hirst donated the work, Beautiful Love Survival, at the Sotheby's London sale, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, to raise money for this organisation. Later, he also contributed his writing to the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009, in support of Survival. The book explores the existence of, and threats to, indigenous cultures around the world.\nIn 2016 he donated artworks for the secret auction of Art on a Postcard, a charity supporting the fight against Hepatitis C.\n\n\n== NFTs ==\nIn July 2021 Hirst announced his first NFT project, named \"The Currency\": it consisted of 10,000 unique hand-painted dot-covered works on paper, each one corresponding to a non-fungible token. Two months later, the project revenued a total of $25,000,000. Hirst instructed those who bought pieces from his latest collection to choose either the physical artwork or the NFT representing it. Buyers were informed that corresponding artworks for the non-exchanged NFTs would be destroyed, with the first 1,000 artworks being burned on October 11, 2022. He streamed the burning of his physical pieces on Instagram live from his London gallery and is set to burn thousands more of his artwork to complete the transformation of the selected artworks so they can exist solely as NFTs. It has been estimated the works being burned are collectively worth almost \u00a310 million.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCharles Saatchi\nStuckist\nJohn LeKay\nYoung British Artists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlanch\u00e9, Ulrich (2018).

Retrospective at Tate Modern, London / UK, Video Damien Hirst. Retrospective at Tate Modern, London, 2012", "Sam Dillemans (born 17 January 1965) is a Belgian painter.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSam Dillemans was born in Leuven, Flemish Brabant, Flanders, Belgium. After high school, Dillemans studied at several academies in Belgium and abroad. He obtained the French Higher National diploma of Plastic Expression Option Art. For some years he has been teaching drawing and painting at the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and was a guest professor at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts of Flanders, also in Antwerp.\nHe now lives and works in Borgerhout, Antwerp.\nA documentary about his work and life, The Madness of Detail, was entered in the \"Creative Documentary\" category at the 21st International Festival of Audiovisual Programmes held in Biarritz, France in January 2008. and won the FIPA d'Or for best creative documentary.\n\n\n== Work ==\nThe work of Dillemans has deep roots in European painting tradition. According to Dillemans, painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and Pablo Picasso are not artists of the past, but artists of today and they continue inspire him in his work. To Dillemans it does not matter when something was painted, but how it was painted. The method of painting, how paint and brushes are used to seek or construct a striking image, is timeless.\nHis work is a quest to find the visual equivalent for the complex interaction between imagination, feeling, consciousness and the painting technique itself. To achieve this goal, Dillemans says, painters have a difficult and at times tedious task to fulfill. They cannot not be satisfied with the clear perception of reality as an evidence of truth, but must try harder to understand more fully their subjects. With thick strokes and an impressive relief on the surface, Dillemans's style contains a refined form of elasticity and plasticity.\nThe process of creation is an important aspect in his work. During this process the paintings appear at times to become gradually more abstract. Dillemans is convinced that a painting only has a chance to take form once the paint begins to take on a life of its own. This style is more firmly rooted in the European tradition rather than that of abstract expressionism and although the strokes become autonomous and follow their own logic, the final form stills holds true to a recognizable and even classical form. Modernism, classicism and academism seem to come together in his work without any contradiction among the styles.\n\n\n== World vision ==\n\nDillemans's world vision is rather sombre. He works intensively and there is much action and movement within his work and in this way his painting becomes an intense occupation. Many painters of the past were also occupied by this same endeavour. Dillemans states that, \"a painter like Ingres drew on his right to be taken seriously. In his case it is about a beautiful aristocratic seriousness which has nothing to do with self glorification. Proof of this is that he was still copying Michelangelo at the age of sixty five.\"\n\n\n== Stages ==\n\nBecause of his prolific work and creativity, Dillemans's output has already passed through several different stages. During the period from 1993 to 2000, he did an intensive study of the female portrait, at times using his wife as a model.  A second period from 2000 to 2003 was a period of reflection during which he studied the old masters. This phase would also influence his later work. From 2003 onward he began a pugilistic painting project with numerous boxing scenes\n in which a rhythmical movement between individual figures and the presence of physical bodies are in constant dialogue with the baroque. He also began a series of portraits of well known figures who he admires including  Ingres and the Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBooks\nBekkers, Ludo; Stegeman, Elly (1995).

Techniques such as blurring and D\u00e9-coll/age are characteristic of his work, as is embedding objects in concrete and the use of television sets in his works. Wolf Vostell was married to the Spanish writer Mercedes Vostell and has two sons, David Vostell and Rafael Vostell.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWolf Vostell was born in Leverkusen, Germany, and put his artistic ideas into practice from 1950 onwards. In 1953, he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and studied at the Academy of Applied Art in Wuppertal. Vostell created his first D\u00e9-coll/age in 1954. In 1955\u20131956, he studied at the \u00c9cole Nationale Superieur des Beaux Arts in Paris and in 1957 he attended the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy of Arts. Vostell's philosophy was built around the idea that destruction is all around us and it runs through all of the twentieth century. He used the term D\u00e9-coll/age, (in connection with a plane crash) in 1954 to refer to the process of tearing down posters, and for the use of mobile fragments of reality. For Vostell, D\u00e9-coll/age is a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media.\nHis first Happening, The Theater is in the Street, took place in Paris in 1958, and incorporated auto parts and a TV. Impressed by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, which he encountered in the electronic studios of the German radio station WDR, he created his electronic TV D\u00e9-coll/age in 1959. This marked the beginning of his dedication to the Fluxus Movement, which he co-founded in 1962. During this period, Vostell was behind many Happenings in New York, Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm among others. In 1962 he participated in the FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik event in Wiesbaden together with Nam June Paik, George Maciunas and other artists. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of Video art and Installation with his work 6-TV-D\u00e9-coll/age shown at the Smolin Gallery in New York, now in the collections of the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid. The Smolin Gallery sponsored two innovative Wolf Vostell events on TV; the first, Wolf Vostell and Television Decollage, featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to create poster art on the walls. In 1967 his Happening Miss Vietnam dealt with the subject of the Vietnam war. In 1968, he founded Labor e.V., a group that was to investigate acoustic and visual events, together with Mauricio Kagel, and others. In 1978 he met Salvador Dal\u00ed, with whom he would later create a joint project with a sculpture from each other in their museums.\nVostell was the first artist to integrate a television set into a work of art. This installation was created in 1958 under the title The black room and is now part of the collection of the art museum Berlinische Galerie in Berlin. Early works with television sets are Transmigracion I-III from 1958 and Elektronischer D\u00e9-coll/age Happening Raum(Electronic D\u00e9-coll/age Happening Room) an Installation from 1968. In 1974, his first major retrospective took place in the ARC 2 at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, an expanded version of which was shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie, in 1974.\nWolf Vostell's automobile-concrete-sculptures made from cars and concrete are to be found in Cologne Ruhender Verkehr (Stationary traffic) from 1969, Concrete Traffic from 1970 in Chicago, VOAEX (Viaje de (H)ormig\u00f3n por la Alta Extremadura) from 1976 in the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de C\u00e1ceres, Spain and \nZwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja (Two Concrete Cadillacs in form of the Naked Maja) from 1987 in Berlin.\nVostell also gained recognition for his drawings and objects, such as images of American B-52 bombers, published under the rubric \"capitalist realism\" and as a result of his inclusion of television sets with his paintings. Nam June Paik and Vostell were both participants in the Fluxus movement and the work of both artists involved a critique of the fetishization of television and the culture of consumption. The catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his screen prints and posters has been published in the Nouvelles de l'estampe by Fran\u00e7oise Woimant and Anne Moeglin-Delcroix in 1982.\nIn 1992, the town of Cologne honoured Vostell with a major retrospective of his work. His pieces were distributed over 6 exhibition venues: Stadtmuseum K\u00f6ln, Kunsthalle K\u00f6ln, Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Schloss Morsbroich Leverkusen and St\u00e4dtisches Museum M\u00fclheim / Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary Vostell 60 - R\u00fcckblick 92 (Vostell 60 - Review 92) was created.\nVostell's grave is at the Cementerio Civil de la Almudena in Madrid.\n\n\n== Artistic work ==\nFrom 1950 on, Vostell implemented his first artistic ideas, in 1953 he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and attended the Werkkunstschule at the Bergische Universit\u00e4t with Ernst Oberhoff in Wuppertal. On 6 September 1954 in Paris, he found the word d\u00e9collage (i.e. to lift off, loosen, loosen the glued, separate) on the title page of Le Figaro, which was used in connection with the crash of a Lockheed Super Constellation into the Shannon. Vostell changed the spelling to D\u00e9-coll/age and applied the term to his poster tear-offs and happenings. For Wolf Vostell, D\u00e9-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art.\nIn 1955/1956 he attended the Parisian \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts and in 1957 the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy. Vostell's Happening Das Theater ist auf der Stra\u00dfe from 1958 in Paris was the first happening in Europe. His happening Cityrama of 1961 in Cologne was the first happening in Germany. Vostell produced objects with televisions and car parts. Influenced by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen in the electronic studio of the WDR, electronic TV-D\u00e9-coll/agen were produced in 1959. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the Fluxus movement, which he co-founded in 1962.\nIn 1959 Vostell founded the Vostell-archive. Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, personal correspondence with companions like Nam June Paik, Joseph Beuys, Dick Higgins, as well as other objects, which documented the work of the artists of his generation. Since the 1990s, Vostell's private library has been part of the archive. His work is documented photographically and is also part of the archive, which has been housed in the \"Museo Vostell Malpartida\" since 2006.\nVostell initiated further happenings, among others 9-Nein-d\u00e9-coll/agen in Wuppertal in 1963, the Happening You in New York in 1964 and others in Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of video art with the installation 6 TV D\u00e9-coll/age in the collection of the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda Madrid and with the video Sun in your head. In 1965 he took part in the 24-hour happening at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal. In 1967 he dealt with the Vietnam War in the happening Miss Vietnam. In 1968, in collaboration with the composer Mauricio Kagel and others, he founded Labor e.V., which was to research acoustic and visual events.\nVostell is regarded as the first artist who integrated a television set into a work of art. This environment from 1958, consisting of three assemblages, entitled Das schwarze Zimmer (German View, Auschwitz Spotlight 568, Treblinka) is part of the collection of the Berlinische Galerie. Early works with televisions are Transmigracion I to III, from 1958, and Elektronischer d\u00e9-coll/age Happening Raum, an installation from 1968.\nSince the 1950s Wolf Vostell has thematized the Holocaust in numerous works. Wolf Vostell did not want to express with his outward appearance that he was Jewish by his appearance he rather carried his values to the outside world and thus directed himself unambiguously against the danger of suppressing or even forgetting the extermination of European Jews by the German National Socialists. With his temple curls, fur hat and caftan, he was a perfect match for the image of the enemy that the propaganda of the Hitler regime had painted as an anti-Semitic stereotype, following the example of the Eastern European Jews. He exaggerated this image by using other attributes, such as ostentatious rings on his fingers and an equally thick cigar, which in slanderous caricatures from the Nazi era had been symbolically given to the \"money-greedy Jewish usurer\".\n\n\n=== First works ===\nIn 1953, he initially produced traditionally produced works such as Korea and Korea Massacre (both oil on paper), War Crucifixion II (oil on canvas) as well as the watercolors The Couple, Family, Airplane and War Crucifixion. In 1955, he drew a cycle of ink drawings on Peter Schlemihl's miraculous story.\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1962 Vostell participated in the Fluxus manifestation Fluxus: International Festival of Contemporary Music in Wiesbaden and in 1963 in the Fluxus festival Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1962 he founded the journal D\u00e9-coll/age - Bulletin of Current Ideas. In 1963 he showed the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room), which is installed in a dark room with black painted walls, in the Galerie Parnass. In 1964 Vostell initiated the Happening In Ulm, around Ulm and around Ulm - in the same year he had his first exhibition participation in the 13th exhibition of the Deutscher K\u00fcnstlerbund in Berlin. In 1965 the Happenings Berlin 100 Ereignisse and 1967 Miss Vietnam followed. He often took up political and social themes.\nBetween 1965 and 1969, exhibitions, happenings, multiples and publications were created in collaboration with Ren\u00e9 Block. In 1968 he created the silkscreen B-52 - instead of bombs. In 1969 - in cooperation with the gallery art intermedia of Helmut Rywelski in Cologne - Vostell created his first car-concrete sculpture Ruhender Verkehr (resting traffic). \nIn January 1970, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Chicago sponsored a happening in which Vostell encased a 1957 Cadillac in concrete at a parking lot near the museum, creating the work Concrete Traffic (1970). The work was moved via highway to the University of Chicago campus in 1970, where it remained for nearly four decades. The work was restored and moved to the University of Chicago campus in 2016.\n\n\n=== Berlin and Malpartida de C\u00e1ceres ===\nIn 1970 Vostell moved to Berlin. In 1970 he created Heuschrecken, an installation with 20 monitors and a video camera. The installations TV-Schuhe and TEK were created in the same year. In 1973 he created the cycle Mania. 40 works in which Vostell drew on photographs from magazines and glued objects onto the photographs. In 1973 he created the installations Auto Fieber und Energie. 1976 Vostell founded the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de C\u00e1ceres. In 1974 he realized the happening Strawberries in Berlin.\nFrom 1975 onwards, he worked on Spanish themes such as the paintings in the Extremadura cycle, the 1976 cycle El muerto que tiene sed (The Thirsty Dead Man) or 1985 El entierro de la Sardina (The Burial of the Sardine). In the 1980s he created the installation The Winds, the painting The Battle of Anghiari from 1982, a reminiscence of Leonardo da Vinci's painting of the same name Battle of Anghiari, the cycle Milonga from 1985, and the Tauromaqie with BMW part from 1988.\nIn the 1980s, he proposed a joint project with Salvador Dal\u00ed whom he met in 1978. This was realized as one of Dal\u00ed's last projects in 1988, shortly before his death. Vostell carried out a work of Dal\u00ed, which Dal\u00ed had already conceived in the 1920s. El fin de Parzival (the end of the Parzival) consists of 20 motorcycles of the Guardia Civil from the time of the Franco regime, five of which are fastened on top of each other and backed by the music of Richard Wagner's opera Parzival. Initially, Dal\u00ed intended to use bicycles. This addition was made by Vostell. In return, Wolf Vostell installed 1988 the sculpture TV-Obelisk (1979) in the Teatre-Museu in Figueres with 14 TV sets and Dal\u00ed completed the sculpture with a woman's head on the top, which he created. Inside the woman's head is a video camera that records images of the sky, which are transmitted to the TV sets.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn Berlin, he created large-format paintings such as the Triptych Berlin from 1990, the cycle Weinende from 1992 and Weinende Hommage an Anne Frank. Bronze sculptures like Berlinerin from 1994 in a small edition. Graphic works, sculptures and assemblages such as Arc de Triomphe N\u00b01 from 1993, Ritz from 1998 and multiples such as Berliner Brot from 1995.\n\n\n== Influence on art ==\n\n\n=== D\u00e9-coll/age and blurring ===\nDuring a stay in Paris in September 1954, Vostell read the word D\u00e9collage in a headline of Le Figaro (German translation: \"Untie, loose the glued, separate\"). Vostell changed the spelling for himself. From 1954 on he named his poster tear-offs D\u00e9-coll/age. Later he transferred the term D\u00e9-coll/age to his happenings. For Wolf Vostell the D\u00e9-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art. Ceres from 1960, Coca-Cola, your candidate, Great Session with Da (all pictures from 1961), Wochenspiegel Beatles and Livio from 1966 are examples of Wolf Vostell's D\u00e9-coll/agen.\nIn the 1960s Vostell worked with the technique of blurring. With a mixture of turpentine and carbon tetrachloride, photographs in magazines can be blurred. The cycle Kleenex from 1962, Kennedy before Corham from 1964, Goethe Today from 1967 and Homage to Henry Ford and Jaqueline Kennedy from 1967 are examples of Wolf Vostell's blurred images. He combined d\u00e9-coll/age with blurring like in Jayne Mansfield from 1968 and Marilyn Monroe from 1962 or Hours of fun from 1968.\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nVostell dealt with world political events in his artistic work from the 1950s on. As early as 1958 he thematized the Second World War and the Holocaust in the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room). The Korean War and the Vietnam War became themes of his works, as they did with his 1968 blurred Miss America. The assassination of John F. Kennedy and other international political events were the subject of his paintings and assemblages.\nVostell also thematized domestic political topics of the Federal Republic. The student revolts, the economic miracle and the criticism of capitalism are documented in his works. The Cold War and the Bosnian War are present in his works. Wolf Vostell documented and processed the fall of the Berlin Wall in more than 50 works. From the 6 meter wide triptych 9 November 1989 to smaller works, Vostell created a further cycle of works after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Over the decades a political work was created in Vostell's work.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nBeginning in 1958 Vostell integrated television sets into his works. Pictures, assemblages, installations and sculptures by Wolf Vostell are often designed with TV sets. Most of the time the sets are set to normal program. Thus Wolf Vostell incorporates topicality and current events into his works.\n\n\n=== Tauromaquia ===\nFrom 1976 Vostell travelled regularly between Berlin and Malpartida de C\u00e1ceres. During this time he created a series of paintings and drawings in his Spanish studio, which show the theme Tauromaquia. Large-format canvases show bulls, mostly bleeding and torn to shreds. He made assemblages in which he combined painted bull heads with light bulbs, car parts or other objects.\n\n\n=== Concrete, lead, and gold ===\nFrom the early 1960s on Vostell worked with concrete, which became a kind of distinctive feature of his works. He created sculptures, like his car-concrete sculptures. He also processed the concrete liquid as a color for his paintings and drawings. He also painted with liquid concrete, acrylic paint and charcoal. In his paintings and drawings you can see many times drawn concrete blocks. Human bodies can often be recognized as angular concrete forms. In the 1980s and 1990s he worked with liquid lead. He poured liquid lead over his canvases, combining acrylic paint, liquid lead and liquid concrete. Wolf Vostell also worked with gold leaf, which he applied directly to the canvas.\nIn his concrete car sculptures, such as Ruhender Verkehr/Stationary Traffic (1969) and Concrete Traffic (1970), Vostell foregrounded these art objects' relationship to the everyday. For Vostell, it was important that these concrete car sculptures be placed an urban setting among other, operational cars. Vostell spoke about de-familiarization provoked by unusual modes of encountering everyday objects: \"I show that there are different realities...I take the TV, the same model that the public has at home, and I defamiliarize it, and this is conceivably shocking... The real disturbance is that their well-known objects, their spoon, their lipstick, their status symbols, their cars are used, and therein lies the content... It is (art)work with familiar objects that causes such disturbances in thinking, in consciousness.\"\n\n\n== Wolf Vostell Archive ==\nIn the 1960s, Vostell founded the Vostell Archive. With great fervour and strict consistency, Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, private correspondence with colleagues such as Nam June Paik, Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins and many others, as well as press cuttings, invitations to exhibitions and events or books and catalogues which document wolf Vostell's work and that of his contemporaries. His private library with more than 6000 books has formed part of the Archive. Wolf Vostell's extensive oeuvre is documented in photographic form and makes up part of the archive. About 50000 documents from four decades make the Vostell Archive a treasure of art history. Since 2005 the archive has been housed in the Museo Vostell Malpartida and is available to art historians, journalists and scholars.\n\n\n== Selected works ==\n\nKorea Massaker, 1953, Museum Fluxus+, Potsdam\nZyklus Guadalupe, 1958\nDas schwarze Zimmer (The black room), 1958, Installation with TV, Berlinische Galerie, Berlin\nTransmigracion, I-III, 1958, Canvas with TV\nDas Theater ist auf der Stra\u00dfe (The theater is on the street), 1958, Happening\nRue de Buci, 1960, D\u00e9-coll/age\nIhr Kandidat, 1961, D\u00e9-coll/age, Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\nCoca-Cola,  1961, D\u00e9-coll/age, Ludwig Museum, K\u00f6ln\nCityrama, 1961, Happening\nWochenspiegel Beatles, 1961, D\u00e9-coll/age, Saarlandmuseum\nMarilyn Monroe, 1962, D\u00e9-coll/age\nZyklus Kleenex, 1962\nMarilyn Monroe Idolo, 1963, D\u00e9-coll/age\n6 TV D\u00e9-coll/age, 1963, Installation, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid\nSun in your head, 1963, Video\nYou, 1964, Installation\nGoethe Heute, 1967, Sprengel Museum Hannover\nHommage an Henry Ford und Jaqueline Kennedy, 1967, Installation, Ludwig Museum\nElektronischer D\u00e9-coll/age Happening Raum, 1968, Installation with TV, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin\nHours of fun, 1968, D\u00e9-coll/age, Berlinische Galerie, Berlin\nMiss America, 1968, Ludwig Museum\nJetzt sind die Deutschen wieder Nr. 1 in Europa, 1968, Germanisches Nationalmuseum\nB-52 - Lippenstift Bomber, 1968\nRuhender Verkehr, 1969, Hohenzollernring, K\u00f6ln\nConcrete Traffic, 1970, Chicago\nHeuschrecken, 1970   Museum Moderner Kunst, MUMOK, Vienna\nAuto-Fieber, 1973, Installation, Museo Vostell Malpartida\nVOAEX, 1976 \nDie Winde, 1981\nDie Steine, 1981\nTaxistand, 1983\nMythos Berlin, 1987, Museo Vostell Malpartida\nZwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja, 1987, Rathenauplatz, Berlin\nLa Tortuga, 1988, Marl\nSchule von Athen, 1988, LVR-LandesMuseum, Bonn\nTauromaquia mit BMW-Teil, 1988\nZyklus Der Fall der Berliner Mauer, 1989\n9.

His works were exhibited at six venues: the Cologne City Museum, the Kunsthalle K\u00f6ln, the Rheinische Landesmuseum Bonn, the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the Schloss Morsbroich in Leverkusen and the Kunstmuseum M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary film Vostell 60 - Retrospective 92 was produced about this retrospective.\nSince 1989, the 1969 car-concrete sculpture Resting Traffic, for which Vostell cast an Opel Kapit\u00e4n in concrete, has stood on the central reservation of the Hohenzollernring in Cologne. Other car-concrete sculptures are Concrete Traffic from 1970 in Chicago, in the Museo Vostell Malpartida V.O.A.E.X. from 1976 and Two Concrete Cadillacs in the shape of the naked Maja in Berlin from 1987.\n\n\n=== Selection of exhibitions and retrospectives ===\n1966: Pictures, Verwischung, happening notations 1961-1966, K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne\n1970: happening & fluxus, K\u00f6lnischer Kunstverein, Cologne\n1974: Retrospective.

His notable works include the congressional portraits of Abraham Lincoln and Lindy Boggs for the United States Capitol, as well as Secretaries of State James Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger's official State Department portraits. He has also painted official portraits of Henry Kissinger, John Mica, and Jon Corzine, among others.\nBittinger made his debut as an illustrator in 1995 with the Passover Sedar fiction children's book The Matzah That Papa Brought Home, which was met with critical acclaim and became an American Library Association Notable Children's Book and a Notable Book for Younger Readers from the Sydney Taylor Book Award. He later illustrated The Blue and the Gray (1996) and Rocking Horse Christmas (1997), both of which received positive reviews from critics. In 2002, he illustrated his latest book, When the Root Children Wake Up, which is a retelling of Sibylle Von Olfers' book, The Root Children, originally published in 1906.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nNed Bittinger was born in 1951 in Washington, D.C. He started painting and drawing in the third grade. When he was 13, his parents sent him to the Cochran Art School of Washington, D.C. He attended Landon School in Bethesda, MD, before leaving for Denison University in Ohio, where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts. In an interview in 2017, Bittinger stated that he originally got an F in painting at Denison University.\nAfter graduating, Bittinger briefly got a job at a commercial arts studio. He also began to practice Transcendental Meditation and would become a teacher of the technique. At age 28, he earned his Master of Fine Arts degree from the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design at George Washington University.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNed Bittinger has received awards and participated in many exhibitions, including an exhibition at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow from 1990 to 1991. Bittinger painted two portraits for the 1994 movie Guarding Tess, one of Shirley Maclaine and the other of her husband in the movie. In 2017 Bittinger estimated that he had painted between 400 and 500 portraits.\n\n\n=== Portrait of Abraham Lincoln ===\n\nIn 2004, the US House of Representatives commissioned Bittinger to paint the|official portrait of Abraham Lincoln. The painting depicts Lincoln at a young age from when he served in the House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849. Ned Bittinger worked from photographs of Lincoln's time in Congress as well as historic images of the House Chamber. The setting includes the John Vanderlyn portrait of George Washington, furniture designed by Thomas Constantine, and many details of the House Chamber's appearance in the 1840s, including the red drapery. Lincoln is depicted sitting at his desk in the old Hall of the House, now called National Statuary Hall. The painting is part of a series of 21st-century portraits depicting noteworthy former members of Congress commissioned by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe painting has been featured in many articles including on Cracked.com and The Imaginative Conservative.\n\n\n=== Portrait of Lindy Boggs ===\n\nOn September 27, 2004, the portrait of Lindy Boggs was unveiled at the Capitol. The portrait includes a small replica of the Car of History clock which has been present in the Old House Chamber since 1819. This clock was included to show Bogg's love for history and commemorate the Commission of the United States House of Representatives Bicentenary, which she chaired. The portrait hangs in the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Women's Reading Room in the US Capitol adjacent to Statuary Hall.\n\n\n=== Henry Kissinger ===\nIn 2005, Bittinger was commissioned the paint a portrait of Henry Kissinger as Chancellor for the College of William and Mary. \"They usher me in, and he looks at me 'who are you' and I say I'm here to paint your portrait, and then I had to pull out this midlevel garb.\" The portrait Depicts Kissinger with his Chancellor robes and chain. Kissinger reportedly objected to using the hat and asked Bittinger to not include it. Bittinger spent the day in Kissinger's office sketching him from life.\nIn a 2017 interview, Bittinger stated that he had also painted Kissinger's dogs at Kissinger's home in Connecticut.\n\n\n=== Ohio Speakers' Portraits ===\nIn 2017, the Ohio Statehouse commissioned seven speakers' portraits with three painted by Bittinger, three by Daniel Greene, and one by Leslie Adams. The portraits were unveiled in a ceremony in the Ohio Statehouse Rotunda on May 23, 2017. \u201cThe seven portraits broaden the scope and artistic diversity of the Ohio Statehouse\u2019s art collection instantly. These works of art will inspire and educate future leaders of Ohio for generations to come,\u201d said The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board executive director, Laura Battocletti.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nBittinger first became interested in illustrating children's books after reading an article about Chris Van Allsburg. He then wrote and illustrated a children's book and sent it to two publishers. Both of the publishers liked his illustrations but did not like the story. It took a year before Bittinger got a call from Scholastic to illustrate The Matzah that Papa Brought Home written by Fran Manushkin. The book was well received by critics and received a starred review from Publishers Weekly. The book ended up selling over 50 thousand copies and became an American Library Association Notable Children's Book and Notable Book for Younger Readers from the Sydney Taylor Book Award. An article in Albemarle Magazine stated that Manushkin was at first unhappy with his first set of paintings Bittinger created because of his lack of originality. Bittinger painted a second set of paintings for the book spending months on the project, and making a plaster cast of the father in the story so he could make a more accurate profile.\nIn 1997 Bittinger illustrated Rocking Horse Christmas written by Mary Pope Osborne, which had a positive reaction from the critics. He spent six months on preliminary drawings and then the paintings for the book. He has also illustrated When the Root Children Wake Up, a retelling of Sibylle Von Olfers' book, The Root Children, originally published in 1906; and The Blue and the Gray written by Eve Bunting which received the \"Hoosier Young Readers' Award\" from the children of Indiana and the \"Teachers' Choice Award\" from The International Readers Association.\nUpon release, When the Root Children Wake Up (2002), written by Audrey Wood, received mixed reviews with Publishers Weekly criticizing Wood's words calling them \"slightly forced\" while also calling Bittinger's illustrations \"a laudable effort, but one that's ultimately less than the sum of its parts.\" Kirkus Reviews called both the words and images \"quite charming\", while also pointing out the difference between Wood's story and the original by Olfers, \"Wood\u2019s tale changes the Root Children\u2019s activities from work to play\u2014not a bad thing, but a definite difference.\" \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBittinger and his wife at the time, Mary, moved out of D.C. to Rappahannock County, Virginia. They later divorced and Bittinger moved out west. In a 2017 interview, he explained \"It was a neighbor across the street who said, 'Why don't you move to Taos' and I said what the hell is Taos.\" Bittinger instead decided to move to Santa Fe where he has remained. In the same interview, he stated he has an 11-year-old son.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThe Matzah That Papa Brought Home by Fran Manushkin. Scholastic, 1995.\nThe Blue and the Gray by Eve Bunting.

His work is associated with the minimalist, monochrome, and color field movements. Since 1958, Simpson has had more than 70 solo exhibitions of his paintings in galleries and museums worldwide. His paintings have been included in hundreds of group exhibitions throughout the United States and Europe. During the early 1960s Simpson was included in two seminal group exhibitions: Americans 1963 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York curated by Dorothy Canning Miller and Post-Painterly Abstraction curated by Clement Greenberg in 1964; that traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art the Walker Art Center and the Art Gallery of Toronto.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDavid Simpson was born in Pasadena, California in 1928 to Frederick Simpson, an interior decorator and expert on 19th century fabrics and furniture and Mary Adeline White, a housewife. After Frederick died in 1936, Mary supported Simpson and his older brother, Robert, by working at the National Tuberculosis Association. In 1952, Simpson met art student Dolores Debus. The two were married the following year in Sierra Madre, California. Simpson has a stepson, Gregory Vose, born in 1949, and a daughter, Lisa Simpson, born in 1953.\nSimpson joined the Navy in 1945, when he was seventeen-years-old. For three years, he served as a Hospital Corpsman stationed near the Mexican border in El Centro, California. After staying on an extra year to help fellow hospital staff with the repercussions of war, Simpson left the Navy in 1949.\n\n\n=== Education ===\nSimpson used payments from the G.I. Bill to attend the San Francisco Art Institute, earning his BFA in 1951. He went on to receive his Master of Arts from San Francisco State University (then San Francisco State College) in 1958. \nWhile in school, Simpson worked the graveyard shift at a gas station and managed the campus cafeteria to cover tuition costs. Simpson has said that studying under professors like Clyfford Still, David Park, and Elmer Bischoff helped him realize that he, too, could make a living teaching and producing art.\n\n\n=== The Six Gallery ===\nIn 1954, Simpson co-founded the Six Gallery at 3119 Fillmore Street in San Francisco alongside Wally Hedrick, a neo-expressionist painter and integral member of the Beat movement ; Deborah Remington, an abstract artist known for hard-edge painting abstraction; Jack Ryan, a poet; Hayward Ellis King, an artist who became the director of the Richmond Art Center, and Jack Spicer, a poet and faculty member at the San Francisco Art Institute. Before it was turned into one of the inaugural student-run cooperative galleries in the area, the space had been an auto-repair shop. Herb Caen wrote in the San Francisco Examiner on September 26, 1954 that the Six Gallery was \"sponsored by six people interested in art, music, poetry, integrity and other worthwhile things.\" Many well-known artists, including Joan Brown and Manuel Neri, held their first one-person shows at the Six Gallery. On October 7, 1955, Allen Ginsberg read his famous poem, \"Howl\" publicly for the first time at a reading at the Six Gallery.\"Howl's\" future publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet Michael McClure, and Jack Kerouac were in the audience, but Simpson, home sleeping after a night shift at his gas station job, missed the reading. The Six Gallery closed in 1957.\n\n\n==== Connection with Jay Defeo ====\nIn 1953, Simpson and Dee lived in the same house as Hedrick and his wife, the artist Jay Defeo (best known for her ten-foot masterpiece, The Rose), on Bay Street in San Francisco. During that time, Simpson and Dee ran the San Francisco Art Institute's cafeteria to help with Simpson's tuition fees. During their shifts at the cafeteria, Defeo babysat the Simpson's newborn daughter, Lisa. Defeo, who worked in numerous mediums including drawing, collage, photography, jewelry, and sculpture, was the subject of a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2013.\n\n\n== Academic work ==\nIn 1959, Simpson accepted a teaching position at the American River Junior College, near Sacramento, California, where he taught for two years before  joining the teaching staff of Contra Costa Junior College in San Pablo, California. In 1965. Simpson became an assistant professor in the art department of the University of California, Berkeley. Five years later, he was promoted to full professor with tenure. \nAfter teaching at Berkeley for twenty-five years, Simpson retired in 1990.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSimpson has had three notable artistic periods during which he produced cohesive works of particular resonance and importance. These phases are the Landscape-Based Abstractions, the Relational Abstractions, and the Interference Paintings.\n\n\n=== Landscape-based abstractions/horizontal stripe paintings (1955\u20131963) ===\n\"During the last several years I have been interested in paintings made up primarily of horizontal stripes and bands. Some of these appear as landscape\u2014some as pure paintings. I've always been more interested in the painting than the landscape,\" \u2013David Simpson, 1962.\nFrom the beginning of his career Simpson has described himself as a reductive rather than minimalist painter. His reductive, abstract landscapes of this period were inspired by the level earth floor and color-smeared sky of the Sacramento Valley. Simpson has related these works to \"Indian blankets, or East-Indian madras, or the American tradition of landscape.\" Their abstract glazes and references to fog and sky caught the attention of the critic Clement Greenberg, who included Simpson in his seminal 1964 exhibition Post-Painterly Abstraction at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art alongside thirty other artists including Frank Stella, Thomas Downing, Helen Frankenthaler, and Ellsworth Kelly. In 1958, Simpson had the first solo exhibition of his career at the San Francisco Art Association gallery, and two years later he participated in the International Sky Festival in Osaka, Japan, both times showing his horizontal stripes paintings.\n\n\n=== Relational abstractions (late 1970s\u2013early 1980s) ===\n\"I placed blocks of color bands right around the edge of the painting instead of in the center. I wanted to keep the center open. [It was] very different from the traditional American landscapes I'd been doing earlier. I wanted to create space so you had room to breathe again in aesthetic terms. I likened them to dense fog pressed up against a window pane.\"\u2014David Simpson \nInfluenced by Piet Mondrian, Mark Rothko, and the Russian avant-garde, Simpson's abstract paintings of the 1970s and 1980s consist of flat, color-blocked rectangles, squares and other geometric shapes seeming to vibrate from relational energy. These meticulously-envisioned paintings involve minute spatial calculations. They depict vividly-colored geometric configurations in push-pull interactions of marked reverberation and intensity.  Particularly notable works from this period include Red Square (1974), Barrio (1979), Quatro Camino, (1980), Five Square Rotation, (1982), and Intra Muros (1983). About Simpson's Red Square\u2014which takes its name from Russian painter and geometric abstract art pioneer Kazimir Malevich's famous Red Square painting (1915)\u2014Kenneth Baker wrote in 2001, \"Each shape pulses with assertions of its own position and scale in the picture's internal space.\" In 2009, the Modernism Gallery in San Francisco held a solo show of Simpson's relational abstraction paintings.\n\n\n=== Interference paintings (late 1980s\u2013present) ===\nIn the late 1980s, Simpson began experimenting with interference paints, soon becoming fascinated with the mercurial characteristics of the medium. Interference paints, which have only six pigment variations containing micro-particles covered with titanium oxide, reflect and refract light, giving rise to nuances of color and optical illusions of depth. Using only one color pigment for each painting and a specially-designed, hand-crafted trowel, Simpson applies on average about thirty coats of paint to each canvas, creating a modulated surface space with which the paint interacts in ripples and layers. In 2011, Simpson had his seventh solo show, Nonsense Poems, at the Haines Gallery in San Francisco, which featured 19 new interference paintings with one-syllable titles such as Blink and Ring. Three paintings of particular importance during this period are April First (2012), Enthrone (2013), and Mississippi (2012). Simpson has created hundreds of interference paintings since he began working with interference pigment more than twenty years ago.\n\n\n== Critics and collectors ==\n\n\n=== The Panza collection ===\nGiuseppe Panza di Biumo (1923-2010) was a pre-eminent contemporary art collector based in Milan and Varese, Italy, and a major collector of Simpson's work. He began purchasing abstract expressionist pieces in the late 1950s before moving on to pop art, minimalism, and conceptualism. He spent the following twenty years amassing one of the most important private collections of postwar American art in the world\u2014over 2,500 pieces by artists including Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, and Donald Judd.  He exhibited the paintings in his 130-room villa in Varese, eventually even converting the stables into galleries for his growing collection. Dr. Panza bought his first Simpson painting in 1990. He went on to acquire over 140 of Simpson's works, mostly his earlier iridescent metallic paintings and then his later interference pigment paintings. Simpson has described Dr. Panza as simultaneously \"supportive and critical, generous and parcimonious, [and] very opinionated.\"  Dr. Panza died in 2010 at the age of 87. His home was turned into a public museum run by Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano, the Italian national trust, in 2000.  Upon his death, Dr. Panza donated a large number of Simpson's interference paintings to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\n\"In the 1970s, Simpson's painting would have taken its place more readily in the narrower context of color-field abstraction, a tendency more associated with New York than the Bay Area. How lucid and soulful Simpson's big paintings of the period look today. They may appear to present themselves wholly at a glance, because they conceal nothing, but it takes time to size up how any one of these pictures operates in terms of color, composition or visual poetics.\"\u2014Kenneth Baker.\n\"Spending time with a David Simpson painting, one experiences shifts of light and color like that which happens when looking at the sky or ocean. Those transitions may appear subtle or spectacular, depending on a work's size and the conditions of its installation, but each canvas is active and also activates viewers in the space around it. In the mid 1980s, Simpson began working with interference paints, an acrylic coated in micro-particles of mica, which upon interacting with light, cause effects like the swirling spectrum of colors visible on the surfaces of oil puddles or soap bubbles. Simpson's skill with the medium is masterful.\"\u2014Louis Grachos.\n\"If anything, Simpson's paintings became more predictable before they grew less so. By the time he was preparing to leave for Sacramento, he'd cast aside cubism to make straightforwardly expressionist landscapes\u2014thickets of childlike brushstrokes that were skillful exercises in the standard Bay Area style of the period. The transition that followed was both radical and natural. His surroundings completely changed, Simpson enlisted primitivism in a wholly new way. Specifically he took up the stacked structure commonly seen in children's drawings, which he ingeniously applied to the extreme horizontals of the Sacramento skyline? No longer was Simpson's primitivism a mannered affectation. It was fully internalized to his composition.\"\u2014Jonathon Keats.\n\n\n=== Survey book ===\nIn May 2016, Radius Books published a survey book of Simpson's life's work entitled, David Simpson Works 1965-2015.  Featuring essays and 120 color illustrations, the book traces Simpson's progression through numerous artistic phases. About the book Simpson has said, \"[It] is an exquisite creation. It does a wonderful job of showing how my work varied and developed over the years.\" The survey book includes exhibition reviews from the Richmond Independent and the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as the transcription of a conversation between Simpson and the art critic Kenneth Baker.\n\n\n== Selected public and private collections ==\nAlbright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York\nBaltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, Maryland\nColgate University, Hamilton, New York\nColumbia Broadcasting System, New York City, New York\nCrocker Art Museum, Sacramento, California\nDavid Owsley Museum of Art Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana\nHerbert F.

He completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at the California Institute for the Arts, Valencia, California, in 1979. His art covers a range of mediums, working with video, sculpture, installation, performance, and painting. He lives and works in New York City.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Manhattan in 1957, Oursler was brought up in a connected and well-to-do family that settled in Nyack, New York. He is the son of former Reader's Digest editor-in-chief Fulton Oursler Jr. and Noel Nevill Oursler. His grandfather was the writer Fulton Oursler.\nAt CalArts, his fellow students included Mike Kelley, Sue Williams, Stephen Prina, and Jim Shaw. John Baldessari \u2014 with whom he did an independent study \u2014 and Laurie Anderson were his teachers. Oursler moved back to New York in 1981 and was picked up by Electronic Arts Intermix.\nIn 1999, Oursler moved to a studio near New York City Hall.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Single-channel tapes: 1977\u20131989 ===\nTony Oursler is known for his fractured-narrative handmade videotapes, including The Loner (1980) and EVOL (1984). Billy Rubin describes EVOL as \"(charting) the territory between our passion-charged personal narratives and the near impossibility of representing that desire visually or linguistically, the end result often being nothing more than banal cultural cliches.\"\nThese works involve elaborate soundtracks, painted sets, stop-action animation, and optical special effects created by the artist. The early videotapes have been exhibited extensively in alternative spaces and museums. They are distributed by Electronic Arts Intermix.\n\n\n=== Early installations ===\nOursler's early installation works are immersive dark-room environments with video, sound, and language mixed with colorful constructed sculptural elements. In these projects, Oursler experimented with methods of removing the moving image from the video monitor using reflections in water, mirrors, glass, and other devices.\nThe early installation Son of Oil, presented at MoMA PS1 in 1982, links the dystopian feelings brought about by conspiracy theories with the perturbing politics of the oil industry.\nThe large-scale installation L7-L5 deals with science fiction as entertainment in contradiction to the terror of first-hand accounts of alien encounters. It was presented at The Kitchen (New York) and the Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam) in 1984.\nSpillchamber (1987) and Spillchamber 2 (1989) were displayed in New York and Japan.\n\n\n=== Projection: 1991 ===\nOursler began working with small LCD video projectors in 1991 in his installation The Watching presented at documenta 9, featuring his first video doll and dummy. This work utilizes handmade soft cloth figures combined with expressive faces animated by video projection.  Oursler then produced a series of installations that combined found objects and video projections. Judy (1993) explored the relationship between multiple personality disorder and mass media. Get Away II features a passive/aggressive projected figure wedged under a mattress that confronts the viewer with blunt, direct address. These installations led to great popular and critical acclaim.\nSignature works have been his talking lights, such as Streetlight (1997), his series of video sculptures of eyes with television screens reflected in the pupils, and ominous talking heads such as Composite Still Life (1999). An installation called Optics (1999) examines the polarity between dark and light in the history of the camera obscura. In his text \"Time Stream\", Oursler proposed that architecture and moving image installation have been forever linked by the camera obscura noting that cave dwellers observed the world as projections via peepholes. The essay both presents a timeline of mimetic technology and serves as an archive of some of Oursler's influences. Oursler's interest in the ephemeral history of the virtual image led to large-scale public projects and permanent installations by 2000.\n\n\n=== Public projects: 2000\u20132009 ===\nThe Public Art Fund and Artangel commissioned the Influence Machine in 2000. This installation marks the artist's first major outdoor project and thematically traced the development of successive communication devices from the telegraph to the personal computer as a means of speaking with the dead. Oursler used smoke, trees, and buildings as projection screens in Madison Square Park, NYC and Soho Square, London. He then completed several permanent public projects in Barcelona, New Zealand, and Arizona, including \"Braincast\" at the Seattle Public Library.\nMillion Colors (2006) was commissioned by the state of Arizona for permanent display at the Phoenix Convention Center in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. While researching this project, Oursler discovered that locals boast that the canyons and desert are graded in more than a million different colors. Aurora sightings and surrounding mountains evoke the lawless and anarchic past of American culture: abandoned goldmines and violent desperadoes of the Wild West. Near Suspicion Mountain, where temperatures reach 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C), mirages are everyday occurrences. These distinct visual elements generate vivid accounts of UFO sightings and industrial-military conspiracy theories. Oursler steeped himself in the allure of the place and tried to give voice to the arid desert landscape. Narratives unique to the mysterious desert are reflected in the spoken texts of the installation, and the resulting collage of scripts performed by Arizona locals and immigrants is an attempt to let the colorful sedimentary history speak for itself.\nIn 2009, he created a series of commissioned video installations at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, New York.\n\n\n=== Public projects: 2010\u20132020 ===\nIn 2013, the  Ekebergparken Sculpture Park commissioned Oursler to create the permanent installation Klang. The installation took the form of three parts: Klang, a large-scale video cave, Spectral Power, an iconic talking lamppost, and Cognitive / Dissonance, two complementary tree projections.\nIn 2014, Oursler simultaneously presented two large-scale installations in the Netherlands: X ergo Y at the Stedelijk Museum and I/O underflow at the Oude Kerk.\nI/O underflow was inspired in part by Alan Turing.\nTear of the Cloud, commissioned by Public Art Fund and curated by Daniel S. Palmer, was presented at Riverside Park along the banks of the Hudson River in the summer of 2018. Technological developments in the region provided significant source material for the artist. The structure of the Internet, which blurs the boundary between culture and technology, is evident in the production of millions of bricks in Haverstraw, New York, and the long-distance communication of the talking drum as a precursor to the invention of Morse code. The artist explores the composition of Samuel Morse's last painting, The Muse, depicting his daughter Susan Walker Morse, uncannily foreshadowing the prototype of his first telegraph. 'The Headless Horseman and his horse are important references in Tear of the Cloud, as they gallop towards artificial intelligence, the chess-playing computer Deep Blue's famous knight sacrifice, facial recognition technologies, and bots which have provoked significant questions about our future', according to Oursler. He suggests connections between the recent DNA CRISPR-Cas encoding of Muybridge's Horse in Motion, the birth of the film industry at the Black Maria studio, the actress and proto-feminist Pearl White\u2019s early silent films created on the Palisades, and the first transistor invented a few miles away at Bell Labs. Mining progressive social movements, the work touches on the mid-19th century Oneida community, their attempts at free love and highly successful manufacturing of silverware and animal traps; the Seneca Falls Convention; counterculture musical and psychedelic experimentation at Woodstock; and the remixing of nascent hip-hop culture in the South Bronx. The river is also characterized by darker connotations including pesticides, PCBs, Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant, and Sybil\u2019s Cave, where the infamous Mary Rogers murder occurred. Oursler will bring these images \u2013 and more \u2013 to life, through the meticulously produced digital projections that evoke the scenarios with kaleidoscopic wonder\", according to Lehmann Maupin. Oursler gave a talk on the piece at the New School, presented by the Public Art Fund. The piece was accompanied by a digitally published glossary of references.\"\n6th, commissioned by the Museum of Old and New Art and Dark Mofo, was presented in the summer of 2019 at the now-defunct Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. The piece revisited the structure which once held the last living Tasmanian tiger, and projected images into cages to \"bear witness to a 'digital de-extinction' of the legendary Tasmanian tiger via sweeping projections, sound and light\", as described by Dark Mofo. Concurrently, the nocturnal installation Beyond the Spectrum was presented at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, which houses rare botanical specimens. The installation of 30 talking lights installed throughout the park were culled from the artist\u2019s archive of more than 20 years of experimentation with the synchronization of light and sound. For this project, the lights were paired with specific plant species throughout the park to be discovered by the wandering viewer.\nAlso in 2019, Oursler presented Eclipse at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, for the exhibition Trees. The piece incorporates ecological themes and the looming loss of the \"enchanted forest\".\n\u7535\u6d41 (Current) (2019) is an installation piece spanning the Nanjing Eye Footbridge, a pedestrian walkway over the river.\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nWhile at California Institute of the Arts, Oursler founded the musical and performance group \"Poetics\" alongside fellow student Mike Kelley. The group included many collaborators over the years, such as John Miller, Jim Shaw, Mitchell Syrop, Bill Stobaugh, Don Kruger, Mark Madel, Art Byington, Dave Muller, Steven Vitiello, Bill Wintersole, Zoe Pettijohn, and Linda Post. In 1997\u201398, Kelley and Oursler presented the Poetics Project at Documenta X, as well as at venues in Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo; through video projections, sound, and artworks, this installation re-created their experience at CalArts as members of a short-lived band. The installation is now on semi-permanent display in the collection of the Pompidou Centre.\nOursler was a longtime friend of David Bowie and collaborated with him on several works. Oursler created the background videos that played at David Bowie's 50th birthday party concert in 1997.  In 2000, Oursler and Bowie collaborated on the four-minute short film Empty, in which Bowie's disembodied head provided narration. Oursler made the video to accompany Bowie's January 2013 single \"Where Are We Now?\", and a piece showing two Bowie heads in conversation with each other for the 2013 \"David Bowie Is\" exhibit organized by the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nOursler became friends with writer and artist Constance DeJong after he saw a performance of hers at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1983. In 1986, they collaborated on Joyride. They then collaborated on the video and performance piece Relatives, first staged at The Kitchen in New York City in 1989.  In 1995, DeJong and Oursler collaborated alongside musician Stephen Vitiello for their piece, \"Fantastic Prayers.\" A CD-ROM of the project was released by Dia in 2000.  \nDeJong is featured in The Watching, which was the first of Oursler's works to project videos onto dolls, and was presented at documenta 9. She performs as Madame X in Oursler's feature-length film Imponderable', presented at MoMa in 2016. The two have collaborated on numerous other occasions over the years.\nOursler has long collaborated with former MIT professor, filmmaker, artist, and bank robber Joe Gibbons. The two met in 1984 and went on to share a house in Jamaica Plain, Mass. while Oursler taught at the Massachusetts College of Art. In the late 1980s through the early \u201890s, Oursler and Gibbons produced a series of videos titled On Our Own. Oursler appears in Gibbons\u2019 feature film The Genius, alongside Karen Finley and Tony Conrad.\nOursler's lifelong friendship and creative partnership with Tony Conrad began in 1980. Oursler introduced Mike Kelley to Tony Conrad, and the two appeared in Conrad's film Beholden to Victory (Hail the Fallen). Oursler and Kelley also appear in Conrad's later film WiP (Women in Prison). Conrad appears in and did the costuming for Oursler's film EVOL. One of Oursler and Conrad's major collaborations was The Influence Machine, a public installation shown at Madison Square Garden in 2000, for which Conrad composed the score. Oursler and Conrad's soundtrack was also published as a CD accompanying the catalogue for The Influence Machine. Conrad is featured in several of Oursler's projection works. The pair's final collaboration was TC: the most interesting man alive, presented at Lisson Gallery. Conrad died on April 9, 2016. Oursler is the director of Tony Conrad's archives.\nOursler met Kim Gordon in the late 1970s and collaborated with her on Making the Nature Scene, a short film examining New York club culture in the 1980s. In 1990, Oursler made the music video for Sonic Youth's song \"Tunic (Song for Karen).\" In 2005, Oursler collaborated with Sonic Youth and filmmaker Phil Morrison on the piece Perfect Partner. Gordon is featured in several of Oursler's works and contributed to the soundtrack material for Oursler's 2018 Tear of the Cloud, a site-specific multimedia installation along the banks of the Hudson River.\n\n\n=== Film and video ===\nSee videos Electronic Arts Intermix \n\n\"Tony Oursler Video Projections\" by Tony Oursler, Inner-Tube Videos. 2002, 27 minutes, Color.

Feldmann's approach to art-making was one of collecting, ordering, and re-presenting.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFeldmann was born on 17 January 1941. In the 1960s, Feldmann studied painting at the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz in Austria. He began working in 1968, producing the first of the small handmade books that would become a signature part of his work. These modest books, simply entitled Bilde (Picture) or Bilder (Pictures), would include one or more reproductions from a certain type\u2014knees of women, shoes, chairs, film stars, etc.--their subjects isolated in their ubiquity and presented without captions. In 1979 Feldmann decided to pull out of the art world and just make books and pictures for himself. In 1989 the curator Kasper K\u00f6nig persuaded Feldmann to exhibit in a gallery again.\nFeldmann died on 24 May 2023, at the age of 82.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFeldmann was a figure in the conceptual art movement and practitioner in the artist book and multiple formats. Feldmann's approach to art-making was one of collecting, ordering, and re-presenting amateur snapshots, print photographic reproductions, toys, and trivial works of art. Feldmann reproduced and recontextualized our reading of them in books, postcards, posters or multiples.\nFeldmann made his first series of books between 1968 and 1971. His works from the early 1970s include 70 snapshots depicting All the Clothes of a Woman and four Time Series projects including, for example, a row of 36 pictures of a ship moving along a river. Feldmann's series Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling clusters 108 nondescript, unframed snapshots of buildings, streets, and parking lots (like other Feldmann projects, this calls to mind Ed Ruscha's photographic catalogs). 11 Left Shoes presents 11 shoes borrowed from \"303 Gallery\"  employees, in a row on the floor. Que Sera has the words of the song of that title handwritten on the wall. Bed With Photograph simulates part of a hotel room with a slept-in bed, a side table, and a framed photograph of a woman in leopard-print pants.\nFeldmann's photographic essays might have a more intimate singularity in book form. His book Secret Picturebook (1973) is a thick, densely printed, scholarly tome with little pictures of women's torsos in sexy underwear inserted at intervals. It most pointedly embodies the artist's mischievous relationship to high culture. Another book, \u201c1967-1993 Die Toten\u201d reproduces images from newspapers of all of the lives lost due to the violence and terrorism that permeated that period of contemporary German history.\nCreating carefully conceived installations from everyday images is what Feldmann is best known for. In 2004\u20132005 MoMA P.S. 1 showed \u201c100 Years,\u201d an exhibition of work by Feldmann composed of 101 photographic portraits of people ages 8 months to 100 years. And at the International Center of Photography in 2008 he filled a room with the framed front pages of 100 newspapers \u2014 from New York, Paris, Dubai, Sydney, Seoul and elsewhere \u2014 printed on 12 September 2001.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nFeldmann was named winner of the eighth Biennal Hugo Boss Prize in 2010. This prize included an exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in May 2011.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nFeldmann's work features in prominent private and public collections, such as that of the Fotomuseum Winterthur and the MACBA in Barcelona. In 2012, the artist donated one of his key works, Die Toten (The Dead), to the Berlin State Museums in Berlin.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nFeldmann was represented by Mehdi Chouakri Gallery in Berlin, Simon Lee Gallery in London, Galerie Francesca Pia in Z\u00fcrich, Galerie Martine Aboucaya in Paris, and the 303 Gallery in New York. He did not limit the number of editions of his works, nor did he sign them.\n\n\n== Publications (selected) ==\nEine Stadt. Essen. Ausst.-Kat.

Cuevas was one of the first to challenge the then dominant Mexican muralism movement as a prominent member of the Generaci\u00f3n de la Ruptura (English: Breakaway Generation). He was a mostly self-taught artist, whose styles and influences are moored to the darker side of life, often depicting distorted figures and the debasement of humanity. He had remained a controversial figure throughout his career, not only for his often shocking images, but also for his opposition to writers and artists who he feels participate in corruption or create only for money. In 1992, the Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas Museum was opened in the historic center of Mexico City holding most of his work and his personal art collection. His grandson Alexis de Chaunac is a contemporary artist.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Childhood ===\nJos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas was born on February 26, 1934, to a middle-class family in Mexico City. He was born on the upper floor of the paper and pencil factory belonging to his paternal grandfather, Adalberto Cuevas.\nWhen he was ten years old, he began studies at the National School of Painting and Sculpture \"La Esmeralda\", and he also started to illustrate newspapers and books. However, he was forced to abandon his studies in 1946 when he contracted rheumatic fever. The illness left him bedridden for two years. During this time, he learned engraving work taught by Lola Cueto of Mexico City College.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAt age fourteen, he rented a space on Donceles street to use as a studio instead of returning to school as his poor health meant that did not know how long he might live. He decided it would be better to dedicate himself to his art. Cuevas learned how to horse back ride and basket weave for money. He worked on illustrations for The News, and despite his lack of formal training, he taught art history classes at Coronet Hall Institute. One element of his training was the opportunity to visit the La Castaneda mental hospital where his brother worked to draw the patients.\n\n\n=== Generaci\u00f3n de la Ruptura ===\nCuevas was sometimes described as vain, a pathological liar and a hypochondriac, obsessed with sickness and death, especially his own. Writer Ren\u00e9 Avil\u00e9s Fabila once said that \u201cThe greatest love of Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas is named Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas, because he is an artist more in love with himself than with his work.\u201d The reason for this quote is that he has done so many self-portraits that it is like having a large number of mirrors. Cuevas stated that he did not believe that he was vain and says that idea started in 1955 when he decided to take a picture of himself every day, which he continued to do up to the end of his life. He was one of the most photographed contemporary artists of Mexico. One ludicrous story states that he visited a \u201cvampire brothel\u201d where they scratch and paw at customers. Other story relates him to a 70-year-old woman named Gloria who he tried to seduce and another one that Marlene Dietrich threw herself at him. He admitted to being a bit paranoid and defensive, concerned about being cast in a negative light. He claimed Julio Scherer Garc\u00eda as an enemy for interfering with his writing career. He also had feuds with painter Rufino Tamayo. He claimed that Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado, Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez Camarena and the \"Frente Popular de Artes Plasticas\" were envious of him and that they accused him of working with the CIA in the 1950s when he was coming out after mainstream artists. Even in his final years, he made deferences by opening his museum to all of his friends but those he considers enemies were not permitted inside.\nIn the 1960s, he went to Morocco to study Islamic art, meeting painter Francis Bacon in Tangiers. He became an atheist after the death of his mother in the 1970s. From 1976 to 1979, he \u201cself-exiled\u201d, leaving Mexico for France, working on various books, serigraphs and lithographs for publication. When he returned to Mexico, he presented the exhibition \u201cJos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas. El regreso de otro hijo pr\u00f3digo.\u201d (Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas. The return of another prodigal son).\nDespite his predictions that he would live to over a hundred because various tarot readings had told him so,\nCuevas died on July 3, 2017, in Mexico City at the age of 83.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nCuevas married his first wife, Bertha Riestra, in 1961. He met Bertha at the La Castaneda hospital while she was there doing community service and painting. Her parents did not attend the wedding as they did not approve of him since he was an artist. Despite being married, he gained a reputation as a womanizer, nicknamed \u201cgato macho\u201d (male cat) or seducer of women, which he took advantage of to promote himself. In a Mexico City newspaper column written by him, he claimed he had over 650 erotic encounters. He states that Bertha was not allowed the same freedom and that she never knew about his affairs despite his writings about them. He and Bertha had three daughters, Mariana, Ximena and Mar\u00eda Jose. In 2000, Berta Riestra, his wife and, at the time, the director of the Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas Museum, died due to breast cancer and leukemia. The following year, he met Beatriz del Carmen Baz\u00e1n, whom he married in 2003 at the museum.\nCuevas and his wife both lived in the San \u00c1ngel neighborhood of Mexico City. The house was built for Cuevas in the 1970s by architects Abraham Zabludovsky and Teodoro Gonz\u00e1lez de Le\u00f3n in a style reminiscent of Luis Barrag\u00e1n. The walls are tones of gray with very straight lines. The interior is minimalist with paintings by the artist on the walls and wood furniture with Mexican textiles. While the house is clean and orderly, the space dedicated as his studio is messy, strewn with books, old machinery, a telescope, mirrors, many photographs and more.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nWithin a career that spanned over seventy years, Cuevas was a painter, writer, draftsman, engraver, illustrator and printmaker. There have been solo exhibitions od Cuevas' work in museums and galleries throughout the world.  His first exhibition was when he was only fourteen at the Seminario Axiologico but no one came, the works came off the walls and were stepped on. His first successful individual exhibition was at Mexico City's Galer\u00eda Prisse in 1953, when he was nineteen.  In 1954, he meets the critic Jose Gomez-Sicre who invites him to exhibit at the Panamerican Union in Washington, DC. This, his first U.S. exhibition, sold out opening night and resulted in interviews with Time and the Washington Post, which called him a \u201cgolden boy,\u201d opening doors and helping to sell his paintings. In 1955, he participated in the first Sal\u00f3n de Arte Libre organized by Galer\u00eda Proteo, where he met David Alfaro Siqueiros. During the rest of the 1950s, he exhibited in Havana, Caracas, Lima and Buenos Aires, where he met Jorge Luis Borges.\nIn the 1960 he exhibited at the David Herbert Gallery, when the NY Times compared him to Picasso. In 1961, two of his works at the Galer\u00eda del L\u2019Oblisco in Rome, Los Funerales de un Dictador and La Ca\u00edda de Franco caused a diplomatic conflict with Spain that asked the images to be removed. In 1962, he exhibited a series of works based on a sculpture by Tilman Riemenschneider he saw in Munich. Cuevas' other exhibitions from this period include one at the Silvan Simone Gallery in 1967.\nDuring the 1970s, he exhibited 72 self-portraits at the Centro Cultural Universitario at UNAM, and exhibited other works at the San Francisco Museum of Art, Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in Caracas, Phoenix Art Museum, the Musee d\u2019Art Moderne in Paris and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico City. In 1976, he had four women tattooed with original designs of his own making, so that the art \u201cwould grow old with him\u201d This despite the fact that tattoos were illegal in Mexico at the time. In 1979 Jose Luis exhibits 50 watercolors and drawings along with illustrated letters at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla, California.\nIn 1981, he opened the exhibit \"Signs of Life\" which contained a vial with his semen and an electrocardiogram taken while he was making love. He stated in the exhibition's brochure that he would impregnate any woman that asked him to do so, but the Secretar\u00eda de Gobernaci\u00f3n made him to remove the brochure because it was then-considered as act of prostitution. In 1982, fourteen galleries in Mexico City, Barcelona, Paris and others held a simultaneous exhibits of \u201cMarzo. Mes de Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas\u201d (\"March. Month of Jose Luis Cuevas.\") From 1984 to 1988, a series of 50 large format drawings called \u201cIntolerance\u201d toured universities and museums in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe.  These drawings were the result of Jose Tasende's gift to Cuevas of the book \"The Witches' Advocate\" by Gustav Henningsen. In 1985 exhibits with Henry Moore and Eduardo Chillida in the exhibition Figure Space Image at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla, California.  The illustrated letters he wrote to his dealer JM Tasende during his exile from Mexico are exhibited at Tasende Gallery prior to becoming part of the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\nIn 1991 \"Celebrating 25 Years with Jose Luis Cuevas\" opens at Tasende Gallery, La Jolla.  He created a Talavera mural which was placed at the Zona Rosa neighborhood in 1995. In 1997 he exhibits at Tasende Gallery, West Hollywood, California. In 1998, he exhibited \u201cRetrospectiva de Dibujo y Escultura\u201d at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda. In 1999, the Pablo Picasso Foundation presented the exhibition \u201cJos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas. Obra Gr\u00e1fica\".\nIn 2001, he donated a sculpture called \u201cFigura Obscena\u201d (Obscene Figure) to the city of Colima. This sculpture became the center of a scandal in 2006.  Other exhibitions from the 2000s include in 2005 \"Jose Luis Cuevas in Drawing and Sculpture\" at the Latin American Art Museum in Long Beach, California. \"Selected Drawings and Watercolors\" Tasende Gallery, West Hollywood, California. In 2006, he inaugurated the Paseo Escult\u00f3rico Nezahualc\u00f3yotl with a sculpture named after his wife called \u201cCarmen.\u201d Retrospective Exhibition at the Museum of the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City in 2008. \u201cExposici\u00f3n Siameses 50 A\u00f1os de la Pl\u00e1stica del Maestro Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas\u201d in 2009 and 2011 and \u201cDibujo y Escultura\u201d in 2010. He continued to actively exhibit his work until his death, especially in Mexico.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nBy the age of fourteen, Cuevas had illustrated numerous periodicals and books. In 1957, he went to Philadelphia to illustrate the book \u201cThe World of Kafka and Cuevas\u201d for Falcon Prest Publishers. In the late 1950s, he began to write on cultural topics for the Novedades de M\u00e9xico publication, where he referred to the then mural artists establishment such as Diego Rivera as the \u201ccortina del nopal\u201d (Nopal Cactus Curtain) and also advocated for greater artistic freedom. This philosophy inspired the founding in 1960 of the group Nueva Presencia, which he joined for a brief time. The group promoted individual expression and figurative art reflecting the contemporary human condition.\nIn the 1960s, his publications included \u201cRecollections of Childhood\u201d (1963), \u201cCuevas-Chareton\u201d (1966), a book of lithographs made at the Tamarind Workshop in Los Angeles inspired by the Marquis de Sade and \u201cHomage to Quevedo\u201d an album of thirteen lithographs dedicated to Francisco de Quevedo.\nIn 1970, he presented \u201cCrime by Cuevas\u201d at the Primera Bienal del Grabado Latinoamericano in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The lithographic series called \u201cCuevas Comedies\u201d was published in 1972, inspired by San Francisco. He \u201cself-exiled\u201d to France where he exhibited at the Modern Art Museum in Paris and the Chartres Cathedral and worked on several books, serigraphs and lithographs in works called \u201cCuaderno de Par\u00eds\u201d and \u201cLa Renaudiere.\u201d The first was honored at the Book Fair in Stuttgart, Germany in 1978.\nIn 1985, he began publishing a column called \u201cCuevario.\u201d In 1987 he worked with the Cr\u00f3nica de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. He published Arte-Objeto and Animales Impuros in 1995, which was inspired by a poem by Jos\u00e9-Miguel Ull\u00e1n. In 2012 he published \u201cCartas amorosas a Beatriz del Carmen\u201d which contains 183 cards drawn by Cuevas for his wife.\n\n\n== Artistic development and influence ==\n\nAs Cuevas' education was interrupted by illness, he was mostly a self-taught artist. He was part of the first generation of Mexican artists to have emerged after the Muralist movement, and a main figure of both the Generaci\u00f3n de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation) and Neo Figurativism, associated with writers and artists such as Carlos Fuentes, Octavio Paz and Fernando Ben\u00edtez.\nCuevas was born and raised in a country which has produced major innovators in the fine arts, and he himself became a symbol of both the continuity of this tradition as well as a permanent break with the past. In particular, Cuevas was an early and very outspoken critic of the muralist movement led by the then-dominant artists Diego Rivera, Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. His critiques focus on how these artists depicted Mexican social intertwine and how much their art was influenced by government propaganda through sponsorship. His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused him trouble at times, including violent public outcry to his work, written insults, personal threats and even once having had his own house attacked with a machine-gun. These are some of the reasons that earned him the nickname of \"il enfant terrible\" (\"The Bad Boy\") of Mexican fine arts.\n\nHis initial opposition to the Mexican cultural status quo was with the muralists, calling them and the government that supported them the \u201cnopal cactus curtain,\u201d acting against newer artists and innovations. His first essay against the \u201cnopal cactus curtain,\u201d was to be published by Exc\u00e9lsior but ultimately rejected by the periodical, although he later renamed and published it as \u201cLetter to Siqueiros\u201d in a magazine titled \"Perfumes y Modas\" (\"Perfumes and Fashions\") and dropped off a copy of the magazine at Siqueiros's house. Later, with the help of Carlos Fuentes he published in \"Museo en la Cultura\" (\"Museum in Culture\"), a supplement of Novedades newspaper, where he continued his critique towards the Mexican muralist movement. Throughout this time, he became friends with a number of other writers such as Fernando Ben\u00edtez, Jos\u00e9 Emilio Pacheco, Jos\u00e9 de la Colina, Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is who, along with writer Carlos Fuentes, were known as \u201cLa Maffia\u201d a critique group of Mexico's then-current culture. It also earned him scorn and critique, especially from Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez and Ra\u00fal Anguiano, as well as strong opposition from many at the Academy of San Carlos. Despite this opposition, Siqueiros wanted Cuevas to become part of the muralist group, saying that his work had an Orozco quality. Since that time, the muralism tradition waned but Cuevas remaines a controversial and oppositional figure, criticizing writers and artists he felt criticized the country's corruption and other problems but at the same time were a party to them. He also stated that he was strongly against opposed to those who he felt used art for \u201cfraudulent\u201d ends as well as those who copied others\u2019 work and those who sold out their art only to make money.\nThemes in Cuevas\u2019 work tend to be bleak, grotesque, enveloped in anguish and fantasy, with human figures distorted to the point of uniqueness. His work has been described as having a \u201cgreat gestural ferocity\u201d often preferring subjects relating to human degradation such as prostitution and despotism. His most characteristic work involves images of disfigured creatures and the misery of the contemporary world. Although he was not opposed to worldly pleasures, they are not depicted in his work. He stated that his work leans more towards the flesh in an \u201cexcessive\u201d way with the presence of death. Cuevas said that his drawing representa the solitude and isolation of contemporary man and man's inability to communicate.  He also stated that it is an \u201cinvitation to return to vegetarianism.\"\nCuevas stated that he drew a skull as he considered them devoid of expression and they are not necessarily representative of death in Mexican culture. He preferred to draw cadavers and bodies shortly after death, as they still retain the individual human qualities. In this approach, he stated that he followed elements of German Expressionism, Catalan Romanesque and Romanticism of the 19th century. He felt very \u201cSpanish\u201d in this as Goya used to paint cadavers as well and yet, far from Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada who drew skulls and bones. His work was influenced by Spanish poetry and Spanish cities as Seville and Barcelona have appeared in his works. His predilection for the darker side of life along with breaking with tradition has meant belated acceptance for his work in certain circles of the art market.\nCuevas\u2019 influences included Goya, writer Francisco de Quevedo, Picasso, with some hues from Posada and Orozco. Over the years, he paid homage to his favorite painters and writers, such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Franz Kafka, Francisco de Quevedo and Marquis de Sade, in numerous series of drawings and prints.\nCuevas's style is aggressive and lacks inhibition which often shocks the observer. Cuevas's drawings, which were done in pen and ink, gouache and watercolor, are mostly done on very large sheets of paper. In many of these drawings, the figures transform into animals or acquire an animal quality. Well acquainted with the cinematic arts, he manipulated data and even concocted events, drawing on his memory for plausible details. His best known event of this type was the creation of the \u201cMural Ef\u00edmero\u201d (Ephemeral Mural), which he created and immediately destroyed publicly as a challenge to the Mexican muralism movement. He gave what is now known as \u201cZona Rosa\u201d its name, located in the then cosmopolitan section of Colonia Juarez, stating that \"Es demasiado ingenua para ser roja, pero demasiado fr\u00edvola para ser blanca, por eso es precisamente rosa\" (\"it's too naive to be red, but too frivolous to be white, that's why it is precisely pink.\")\nHis work reates controversy to the end and his appearance attracted large numbers of women.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nCuevas\u2019 earliest award was in 1959, the International First Prize for Drawing at the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale, with 40 works from the series Funeral of a Dictator, which was followed by First Prize at the International Black and White Exhibition in Lugano, Switzerland, in 1962. His other awards from the 1960s include the Prize for Excellence in Art and Design at the 29th Annual Exhibition of the Art Directors\u2019 Club, Philadelphia, United States, in 1964, Premio Madeco at the II Bienal Iberoamericana de Grabado at the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in Santiago, Chile, in 1965 and First International Prize for Printmaking, Triennial of Graphic Arts, New Delhi, India, 1968.\nIn 1977 he won First Prize at the III Latin American Print Biennial in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In 1981, he earned the National Prize of Culture, which signified his acceptance by the people of Mexico. Cuevas' other honors of the 1980s included having his work exhibited at the 1982 Venice Biennial, Premio Nacional de Arte from the Mexican government in the same year, and the International Prize from the World Council of Engraving in the United States.\nIn the 1990s, he received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France in 1991, induction in the National System of Creators of Mexico in 1993 and In 1997 the Premio de Medall\u00edstica Tom\u00e1s Francisco Prieta from Queen Sof\u00eda of Spain .\nIn the 2000s he received the Jerusalem Prize from the City of Jerusalem and the World Zionist Organization in 2007 and the Lorenzo the Great Prize at the VIII Biennial of Florence in 2012.\nIn addition to awards for his artwork, Cuevas received other honors as well. These include honorary doctorates from Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Sinaloa (1984), the Universidad Veracruzana (2004), the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropolitana (2007) and the Instituto Superior de Arte and the Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas in Havana (2008). He was honored as Captain of the Yaqui Army by the leaders of the Yaqui people in 1996. In 1989, the cities of Monterrey and Tijuana declared him an \u201chonored guest\u201d and he received the keys to the two cities.\n\n\n== Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas Museum ==\n\nIn the late 1980s, Cuevas obtained the old monastery of Santa In\u00e9s in Mexico City's historical center for the purpose of creating the Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas Museum, which was inaugurated in 1992. The first director of the museum was his first wife, Bertha until her death in 2000. In 2005, his second wife, Beatriz del Carmen, took over operations. The Museum has been backed by the Fundaci\u00f3n Maestro Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas since 2003. Because of the opposition in some essential artistic statements between Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas and some professors in the Academia de  San Carlos, which is located half a block to the south, the artistic community in this art school say \"el vecino de enfrente\" (neighbor from across the street\" to refer to the now late artist and the Museum).\nThe Museum's collection includes more than 1860 pieces by various artists, mostly from Latin America. The pieces are rotated among the various building's rooms. One of the main pieces is \"La Giganta\" (\"The Giantess\") by Cuevas, which is situated in the central courtyard. The androgynous sculpture was created in 1991 and inspired by a poem by Baudelaire. The museum is considered to be controversial in no small part due to the \u201cErotic Room,\" filled with Cuevas' own drawings on the theme and of actual bordellos and cabarets, and the presence of a large brass bed on which he claimed he had many sexual encounters. The museum also contains a library with 45 large volumes with over 11,500 newspaper clippings as well as 500 books dedicated to Cuevas' work.\n\n\tGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas at Wikimedia Commons", "Jack Smith (November 14, 1932 \u2013 September 18, 1989) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pioneer of underground cinema. He is generally acclaimed as a founding father of American performance art, and has been critically recognized as a master photographer.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nSmith was raised in Texas, where he made his first film, Buzzards over Baghdad, in 1952. He moved to New York City in 1953.\nThe most famous of Smith's productions is Flaming Creatures (1963). The film, that first put camp on the map, is a satire of Hollywood B movies and tribute to actress Maria Montez, who starred in many such productions. However, authorities considered some scenes to be pornographic. Copies of the movie were confiscated at the premiere, and it was subsequently banned from public view. Despite not being viewable, the movie gained some anti-heroic notoriety when footage was screened during Congressional hearings and right-wing politician Strom Thurmond mentioned it in anti-porn speeches.\nSmith's next movie Normal Love (aka Normal Fantasy, Exotic Landlordism of Crab Lagoon, and The Great Pasty Triumph) (1963\u20131964) was the only work in Smith's oeuvre with an almost conventional length (120 mins.), and featured multiple underground stars, including Mario Montez, Diane di Prima, Tiny Tim, Francis Francine, Beverly Grant, John Vaccaro, and others. The rest of his productions consists mainly of short movies, many never screened in a cinema, but featured in performances and constantly re-edited to fit the stage needs (including Normal Love).\nAfter his last completed film, No President (1967), (Smith\u2019s follow-up film, Sinbad In the Rented World (1972\u20131984) was never completed) he created small intermedia performance and experimental theatre work until his death on September 25, 1989, from AIDS-related pneumonia. Smith produced many theatrical mini-productions, often using slide projectors, in his loft and in art space settings such as Artists Space and Colab's The Times Square Show. Descriptors of lobsters as greedy landlords dominate, along with crabs, Atlantis, 1950s exotica music, and camp-glamorous North African costumes. A pungent odor of burning incense and marijuana often perfumed the performances.\nApart from appearing in his own work, Smith worked as an actor. He played the lead in Andy Warhol's unfinished film Batman Dracula, Ken Jacobs's Blonde Cobra, and appeared in several theater productions by Robert Wilson.\nSmith also worked as a photographer and founded the Hyperbole Photographic Studio in New York City. In 1962, he released The Beautiful Book, a collection of pictures of New York artists, that was re-published in facsimile by Granary Books in 2001. As a draftsman, his posters, hand written scripts and drawing-notes superimpose a very eccentric personal imagery onto the traditional language of theater. \nIn 1978, Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer conducted a 13-page interview with Smith (with photos) in Columbia University's philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e). It was collected in 2013 in Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book. In 2014, it was released as a limited-ledition vinyl picture disc by Semiotext(e). \nIn 1987, Smith was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.\n\n\n== Estate ==\nIn 1989, New York performance artist Penny Arcade tried to salvage Smith's work from his apartment after his long bout with AIDS and subsequent death. Arcade attempted to preserve the apartment as Smith had transformed it \u2013 an elaborate stage set for his never-to-be-filmed epic Sinbad in a Rented World \u2013 as a museum dedicated to Jack Smith and his work. This effort failed.\nUntil recently, Smith's archive was co-managed by Arcade, alongside the film historian J. Hoberman via their corporation, The Plaster Foundation, Inc. Within ten years of Smith's death, the Foundation, operating largely without funding but through donations and good will, was able to restore all of Smith's films, create a major retrospective curated by Edward Leffingwell at PS 1, the Contemporary Arts Museum, now part of MoMA, put his films back into international distribution, and publish several books on Jack Smith and his work.\nIn January 2004, the New York Surrogate's Court ordered Hoberman and Arcade to return Smith's archive to his legal heir, estranged, surviving sister Sue Slater. Hoberman and Arcade fought to dismiss Slater's claim, arguing that she abandoned Jack's apartment and its contents; the Plaster Foundation created the archive and took possession of the work only after 14 years of repeated, documented attempts at communication with her. In a six-minute trial, Judge Eve Preminger rejected the Foundation's argument and awarded the archive to Slater.\nBy October 2006, the foundation still refused to surrender Smith's archive to the estate, claiming money owed them for expenses associated with managing the archive\u2014and hoping Smith's work would be bought by an appropriate public institution that could safeguard his legacy and keep the works in the public eye. According to curator Jerry Tartaglia, the dispute was resolved as of 2008, with the purchase of Smith's estate by the Gladstone Gallery.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSmith was one of the first proponents of the aesthetics which came to be known as 'camp' and 'trash', using no-budget means of production (e.g. using discarded color reversal film stock) to create a visual cosmos heavily influenced by Hollywood kitsch, orientalism and with Flaming Creatures created drag culture as it is currently known. Smith was heavily involved with John Vaccaro, founder of The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, whose disregard for conventional theater practice deeply influenced Smith's ideas about performance art. In turn, Vaccaro was deeply influenced by Smith's aesthetics. It was Vaccaro who introduced Smith to glitter and in 1966 and 1967, Smith created costumes for Vaccaro's Playhouse of The Ridiculous. Smith's style influenced the film work of Andy Warhol as well as the early work of John Waters.  While all three were part of the 1960s gay arts movement, Vaccaro and Smith disputed the idea that their sexual orientation was responsible for their art.\nIn 1992, performer Ron Vawter recreated Smith's performance \"What's Underground about Marshmallows\" in Roy Cohn/Jack Smith which he presented in a live performance and which was later released as a film directed by Jill Godmilow and produced by Jonathan Demme.\nPlaywright Richard Foreman was influenced by Smith.\nTony Conrad produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled  56 Ludlow Street that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.\nIn 2017, Jerry Tartaglia directed a documentary called Escape from Rented Island: The Lost Paradise of Jack Smith which is a film essay concerning the works of Jack Smith, aimed at the artist's most devoted followers.\nIn 2009, Germany's  Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art staged Five Flaming Days in a Rented World, a festival and conference on Smith's work. The event included several commissioned short films in tribute to Smith's films, the most noted of which was Guy Maddin's The Little White Cloud That Cried.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nBy Jack Smith\n1952: Buzzards Over Baghdad\n1961: Scotch Tape\n1963: Flaming Creatures (b/w, 46 minutes)\n1963: Normal Love (120 minutes)\n1967: No President (a/k/a The Kidnapping of Wendell Willkie by The Love Bandit, ca. minutes)\nWith Jack Smith as actor\n1960: in Ken Jacobs's Little Stabs at Happiness\n1963: in Jacobs's Blonde Cobra\n1963: in Ron Rice's Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man\n1963: in Rice's Chumlum\n1965: in Andy Warhol's Camp\n1966: in Warhol's Hedy (a/k/a Hedy the Shoplifter) starring Mario Montez and Mary Woronov\n1971: in John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Up Your Legs Forever\n1974: in Ted Gershunny's Silent Night, Bloody Night starring Mary Woronov, Patrick O'Neal, John Carradine, Candy Darling, Ondine, and Tally Brown\n1989: in Ari Roussimoff (Frankenhooker)'s Shadows in the City\nAbout Jack Smith\n2006: Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis, documentary written, directed, and co-produced by Mary Jordan\n\n\n== Books by Smith ==\n1960 16 Immortal Photos\n1962 The Beautiful Book (dead language press, republished 2001 Granary Books)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHoberman, J., On Jack Smith's 'Flaming Creatures' (And Other Secret-Flix of Cinemaroc), New York: Granary Books, 2001\nJ.

Quinn explores \"what it is to be human in the world today\" through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, environment, and the media. His work has used materials that vary widely, from blood, bread and flowers, to marble and stainless steel. Quinn has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Sir John Soane's Museum, the Tate Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Fondation Beyeler, Fondazione Prada, and South London Gallery. The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement.\nQuinn is internationally celebrated and was awarded the commission for the first edition of the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2004, for which he exhibited Alison Lapper Pregnant. Quinn's notorious frozen self-portrait series made of his own blood, Self (1991\u2013present) was subject to a retrospective at Fondation Beyeler in 2009.\nQuinn lives and works in London.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nQuinn was born in London on 8 January 1964 to a French mother and a British father. He spent his early years in Paris, where his father was a physicist working at the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures). Quinn recalls an early fascination with the scientific instruments in his father's laboratory, in particular atomic clocks. He attended Millfield (a private boarding-school in Somerset), and studied history and history of art at Robinson College, Cambridge.\nIn the early 1990s, Quinn was the first artist to be represented by gallerist Jay Jopling. The artist had his first exhibition with Jopling in 1991, exhibiting Self (1991), a frozen self-portrait made out of nine pints of the artist's blood.\nDuring the 1990s, Quinn and several peers were identified for their radical approach to the making and experiencing of art. In 1992, the loosely affiliated group was called the 'Young British Artists' by writer Michael Corris in Artforum, and included Cornelia Parker, Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin.\nIn 1995, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Tate Britain where new sculptures were shown as part of the Art Now series. In 1997 Quinn's work Self (1991), was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London for the exhibition Sensation. Quinn's Self, along with works by Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, were already well known to the British public. The exhibition received widespread media attention and had a record number of visitors for a contemporary art exhibition. The exhibition then travelled to the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, and to the Brooklyn Museum, New York.\nIn 1998, he was given a solo exhibition at the South London Gallery, and in 1999, he had a solo exhibition at Kunstverein Hannover. The Groninger Museum presented a solo exhibition of Quinn's work in 2000. The artist was then invited to present a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2000, where he presented an ambitious new work Garden. In 2002, he was given a solo exhibition at Tate Liverpool which included new works and photography, and coincided with the Liverpool Biennial, where Quinn presented 1+1=3. In 2001, the National Portrait Gallery gave Quinn a solo exhibition for his genomic portrait of Sir John Sulston.\nIn 2004 Quinn was awarded the first ever commission for the Fourth Plinth in London's Trafalgar Square, for which he produced a marble sculpture of pregnant disabled artist, Alison Lapper.\nIn 2006, Museo d'Arte Contemporanea Rome presented Marc Quinn's works in a solo exhibition focused on his recent figurative sculpture, and in 2009, the Fondation Beyeler presented a solo exhibition of Marc Quinn's ongoing series Self, including all sculptures from 1991 to 2006.\nIn 2012, Quinn was commissioned to produce a monumental work for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games at the London Olympics 2012, for which he produced Breath, a monumental sculpture of Alison Lapper held up by air.\nIn 2013, Quinn presented a solo exhibition on the occasion of the 55th Venice Biennale for art, at Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, curated by Germano Celant.\nQuinn's first monograph Memory Box by Germano Celant was published in 2013. A feature-length documentary about Quinn's life and work, Making Waves, was released in 2014, produced and directed by Gerry Fox. London's Somerset House presented a solo exhibition of Quinn in 2015, focusing on recent sculptures.\nIn 2017, Marc Quinn staged a major exhibition at the Sir John Soane's Museum in London. The exhibition was the first in a new series of collaborations with contemporary artists, designers, and architects, which, inspired by the spirit of Sir John Soane, sought to bring the collection to life in innovative ways.\n\n\n== Works ==\nQuinn's early work was concerned with issues of corporeality, decay, and preservation. He experimented with organic and degradable materials including bread, blood, lead, flowers and DNA producing sculpture and installation, including Bread Sculptures (1988), Self (1991), Emotional Detox (1995), Garden (2000), and DNA Portrait of John Sulston (2001). In the 2000s, he began to focus on the use of marble, bronze, and concrete. The artist explored the body and its extremes through the lens of classical and urban materials; works included The Complete Marbles (1999\u20132005), Alison Lapper Pregnant (2004), Evolution (2005\u20132009) and Planet (2008). Since 2010 he has worked with metals including stainless steel, aluminium, graffiti paints, seaside detritus, tapestry and painting, as seen in The History Paintings (2009\u2013present) and The Toxic Sublime (2014\u2013present).\n\n\n== Early works: 1991\u20132000 ==\n\n\n=== Self, 1991 \u2013 present ===\nThe first work of Quinn's to gain international fame was Self, which was exhibited in 1991, when he was 27. Self (1991) is a self-portrait formed by a frozen cast of 10 pints of the artist's blood. It is an ongoing work, where the artist portrays himself every five years through a new cast with new blood.\nThe artworks are placed in transparent plexiglass-glass boxes, on top of freezing cabinets. This highlights a theme of the works, which is dependency.\nSelf (2006) is owned by the National Portrait Gallery, London.\n\n\n=== Emotional Detox, 1995 ===\nIn 1995 Quinn produced Emotional Detox, a series of seven sculptures made of lead and cast from the artist's own body, were created at this time. Inspired by traditional iconography of the seven deadly sins, in each sculpture Quinn's body is being torn apart and reconfigured, reflecting detoxification as both a physical and psychological battle.\nEmotional Detox has been exhibited at Tate Britain, London (1995), Groninger Museum, The Netherlands (2000), and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2015).\n\n\n=== Garden (2000) ===\n\nIn 2000, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada, Milan, which included his most ambitious works, involving organic matter. Garden is a 12-metre-long, 3-metre-high sculpture in which thousands of flowers are frozen in silicone oil. The work now belongs to the Fondazione Prada collection)\n\n\n== Notable works: 2000\u20132010 ==\n\n\n=== Portrait of John E. Sulston (2001) ===\nQuinn's portrait of John E. Sulston, who won the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2002 for sequencing the human genome on the Human Genome Project, is in the National Portrait Gallery. It consists of bacteria containing Sulston's DNA in agar jelly. \"The portrait was made by our standard methods for DNA cloning\", writes Sulston. \"My DNA was broken randomly into segments, and treated so that they could be replicated in bacteria. The bacteria containing the DNA segments were spread out on agar jelly in the plate you see in the portrait.\"\n\n\n=== Alison Lapper, The Fourth Plinth (2005\u20132007) ===\nQuinn has made a series of marble sculptures of people either born with limbs missing or who have had them amputated. This culminated in his 15-ton marble statue of Alison Lapper, a fellow artist born with no arms and severely shortened legs, which was displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London from September 2005 until October 2007. (The Fourth Plinth is used for rotating displays of sculpture.) In Disability Studies Quarterly, Ann Millett writes, \"The work has been highly criticized for capitalizing on the shock value of disability, as well as lauded for its progressive social values. Alison Lapper Pregnant and the controversy surrounding it showcase disability issues at the forefront of current debates in contemporary art\".\nA large reproduction of the sculpture was used as a central element of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.\n\n\n=== Sphinx (2006) and Siren (2008) ===\n\nSince 2006, Marc Quinn has made numerous studies of the supermodel Kate Moss. In April 2006, Sphinx, a sculpture of Kate Moss by Quinn, was revealed. The sculpture shows Moss in a yoga position with her ankles and arms wrapped behind her ears. This body of work culminated in an exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in May 2007. The sculpture is on permanent display in Folketeatret in Oslo, Norway.\nIn August 2008, Quinn unveiled another sculpture of Moss in solid 18-carat gold called Siren, which was exhibited at the British Museum in London. The life-size sculpture was promoted as \"the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt\".\n\n\n=== History Paintings (2009 \u2013 present) ===\nIn 2009 Quinn began his \"History Paintings\" series which has continued to evolve.  The initial group of work in this effort were of enlarged press photos of conflicts around the world rendered into oil on canvas paintings or silk or wool jacquard tapestries.\n\n\n== Notable works: 2010 \u2013 present ==\n\nIn May 2010, Quinn revealed a series of new sculptures at London's White Cube gallery including The Ecstatic Autogenesis of Pamela based on film actress Pamela Anderson and Chelsea Charms based on pornography model Chelsea Charms.\nQuinn's models have included \"Catman\" Dennis Avner (who has been tattooed to look like a cat) and transgender people such as Thomas Beatie, Buck Angel, and Allanah Starr. Quinn's portrait sculpture \"Buck & Allanah\" depicts the two nude, standing hand in hand, in a pose reminiscent of Adam and Eve. The sculpture of Thomas Beatie depicts him at full-term pregnancy, bowing his head and cradling his abdomen with two hands.\nThe exhibition also included a new series of flower paintings executed in reversed colour and two large-scale orchid sculptures in white painted bronze, installed in Hoxton Square, opposite the gallery.\n\n\n=== The Toxic Sublime (2015) ===\nIn 2015 Marc Quinn opened an exhibition of new work at White Cube Bermondsey, entitled The Toxic Sublime. It featured new bodies of work that explore the ecological impact of man on nature. \u2018The Toxic Sublimes\u2019 are distorted, three dimensional seascapes. Alongside these paintings, a new series of sculptures, cast in stainless steel, including one measuring over 7.5 meters long, form part of a body of work titled Frozen Waves. The sculptures originate from the core of shells, eroded by the endless action of waves.\n\n\n=== All About Love (2016\u20132017) ===\nIn 2017, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Sir John Soane's Museum in London. A display of 12 life-cast sculptures, the All About Love series explore the notion of love through the expression of classical fragmented sculpture. Created in collaboration with his partner at the time, the sculptures, which depict the two embracing one another, are works that echo sculptures of many periods from the Renaissance to Auguste Rodin.\n\n\n=== A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 ===\n\nThe sculpture A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 was erected secretly in Bristol in the early morning of 15 July 2020; it is Quinn's statue of Black Lives Matter protester, Jen Reid. The statue was mounted on the plinth which formerly held a 19th-century statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol merchant, philanthropist, and Tory Member of Parliament (MP) who had been involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Just over 24 hours after the statue was installed, the Bristol City Council had it taken down as it did not have permission to be installed. The Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, invited Quinn to make a contribution towards the cost to the council of having his statue removed.\n\n\n=== Viral Paintings (2020) ===\nThis currently ongoing series of paintings by Quinn are of paint splattered over blown up screen shots of photos and news stories of current events taken on his cell phone and created during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  These new works are considered a continuation of his  History Painting series begun in 2009.\n\n\n== Charity auctions ==\nQuinn has participated in a number of charity auctions since 2010. His work was auctioned for the UK's homelessness charity, Crisis, in collaboration with Vogue at Christie's in 2010. In 2013, he donated work to the Mimi Foundation charity for cancer auction at Sotheby's. He donated work to the charity auction for Peace One Day at Bonhams, curated by Jake Chapman, in 2014 and 2015.\nIn 2013 Quinn was commissioned to make a work for RHS Chelsea Flower Show, marking the first time an artist collaborated with the flower show in its 100-year history. The Rush of Nature (2013) was auctioned at Sotheby\u2019s to help raise money for RHS Chelsea Centenary Appeal.\nWork by Quinn was auctioned at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation annual St. Tropez Gala in 2016, supporting environmental protection.\n\n\n== Public collections ==\nThe work of the artist is held, among others, in the following public collections:\n\nAstrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo\nBerardo Collection Museum, Lisbon\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\nMus\u00e9e d'art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al\nMus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Paris\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\nNational Portrait Gallery, London\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\nTate Modern, London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website", "Michael Landy  (born 1963) is one of the Young British Artists (YBAs). He is best known for the performance piece installation Break Down (2001), in which he destroyed all his possessions, and for the Art Bin project (2010) at the South London Gallery. On 29 May 2008, Landy was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in London.\n\n\n== Early life and works ==\nLandy was born in London. He first studied art in Loughton and Loughborough, then at Goldsmiths College in London, having been inspired to take up art professionally after having a picture selected for display on the BBC television art program Take Hart.\nAfter graduating from Goldsmiths in 1988, he exhibited in the Freeze exhibition, organised by Damien Hirst\u2014an exhibition which first brought together a group of artists that would later become known as the Young British Artists.\nIn 1990, Landy exhibited in East Country Yard with several of the artists from Freeze. His first solo exhibition was Market (1990), an installation comprising numerous empty market stalls. Like much of his later work it was intended as a comment on consumerism and society.\nIn 1992, Landy started an association with Karsten Schubert by making Closing Down Sale for his gallery, an installation made up of a number of objects in shopping trolleys labelled \"BARGAIN\" and recorded announcements encouraging visitors to buy. The work was intended as a comment on the commodification of art, and might be seen as a precursor of sorts to Break Down, a work which produced no salable objects, except an edition of inventories (books) listing all destroyed items.\nBefore Break Down, Landy's best-known work was Scrapheap Services (1995\u20131996), which featured a fictitious cleaning company which sought to change society by way of \"a minority of people being discarded\". Promotional videos were made for the company and a large number of cut-out men were made from old magazines to be swept up and destroyed. This installation typifies the YBAs' interests in transforming the mundane into art, and recontextualisation. Its visual impact on one level is a typical industrial event, yet the gallery environment and bright red figures, along with the sinister irony of the title, is intended to force the viewer to address issues of humanity and consumerism.\n\nIn 1997, work which Landy had previously sold to Charles Saatchi was included in the Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. This show later toured Berlin and New York, but Landy's work was somewhat overshadowed by some of the other more outrageous artworks.\n\n\n== Break Down ==\nBreak Down, the work which put him in the public eye, was held in February 2001 at an old branch of the clothes store C&A on Oxford Street in London (C&A had recently ceased trading, and the shop had been emptied). Landy gathered together all his possessions, ranging from postage stamps to his car, and including all his clothes and works of art by himself and others, painstakingly catalogued all 7,227 of them in detail, and then destroyed all in public. The process of destruction was done on something resembling an assembly line in a mass production factory, with ten workers reducing each item to its basic materials and then shredding them.\nThe exhibition was a joint commission from The Times newspaper and Artangel, and attracted around 45,000 visitors. At the end of the process all that was left was bags of rubbish, none of which was sold or exhibited in any form. An edition of inventory books listing all destroyed items was available to buy when exiting through the gift shop.\nLandy made no money as a direct result of Break Down, and following it had no possessions at all.\n\n\n== Later works ==\nLandy made little art in the year following Break Down before returning with a solo show in late 2002, entitled Nourishment. The exhibition consisted of a series of detailed etchings of weeds, rendered in the traditional style of botanical draughtsmanship. The intricate detailing is reported to have resulted in lasting eye damage for Landy.\nIn 2003, Landy was selected to chair the judging panel for the Beck's Futures art prize.\nIn 2008, Ridinghouse published Michael Landy: Everything Must Go!, Landy's first monograph, which brings together over 20 years of the artist's work for the first time. It was in this year that Landy was elected a member of the Royal Academy.\nLandy's Art Bin installation for the South London Gallery in February\u2013March 2010 was described by the artist as \"a monument to creative failure.\" A large transparent skip was installed at the gallery, into which he invited the public to throw art work with which they were dissatisfied. Artists and collectors were invited to apply to dispose of works of art via a dedicated website.\nIn 2016, Museum Tinguely Basel curated Landy's first retrospective exhibition titled \"Michael Landy. Out of Order\". It spanned his entire career, bringing together works from Break Down, Credit Card Destroying Machine, and Saints Alive among many others. \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLandy's partner is fellow British artist Gillian Wearing.\nHe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to art.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWhat Do Artists Do All Day?\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArtist Project \u2013 Hello Weed \u2014 Tate Magazine, Issue 3 (brief overview of Landy's work and commentary on Nourishment).\nPaper on Scrapheap Services\nMan in Oxford Street is Auto-destructive\nTate: Michael Landy on the Scrap Heap The artist talks about the influence of Jean Tinguely on his work. 3 November 2009.\nTateShots: Michael Landy The artist on his drawing of portraits. 9 October 2008.\nBreaking-News Athens", "Cornelia Ann Parker  (born 14 July 1956) is an English visual artist, best known for her sculpture and installation art.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nParker was born in 1956 in Cheshire, England. She studied at the Gloucestershire College of Art and Design (1974\u201375) and Wolverhampton Polytechnic (1975\u201378). She received her MFA from Reading University in 1982 and honorary doctorates from the University of Wolverhampton in 2000, the University of Birmingham (2005), the University of Gloucestershire (2008) and the University of Manchester (2017).\nIn 1997, Parker was shortlisted for the Turner Prize along with Christine Borland, Angela Bulloch, and Gillian Wearing (who won the prize). She was Honorary Professor at the University of Manchester 2015-2018 and between 2016 and 2019 was Visiting Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall Oxford. She was appointed Honorary Fellow at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 2020.\nParker has one daughter, and lives and works in London. Parker's mother was German and was a nurse in the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. Her British grandfather fought in the Battle of the Somme in the First World War.\nCornelia Parker's first solo museum exhibition was at the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston in 2000. In 2019 she had a survey exhibition at MCA Sydney. A major survey exhibition of her work opened at Tate Britain in May 2022.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nParker is best known for large-scale installations such as Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View (1991) \u2013 first shown at the Chisenhale Gallery in Bow, East London \u2013 for which she had a garden shed blown up by the British Army and suspended the fragments as if suspending the explosion process in time. In the centre was a light which cast the shadows of the wood dramatically on the walls of the room. This inspired an orchestral composition of the same name by Joo Yeon Sir.\nIn contrast, in 1997 at the Turner Prize exhibition, Parker exhibited Mass (Colder Darker Matter) (1997), suspending the charred remains of a church that had been struck by lightning in Texas. Eight years later, Parker made a companion piece \"Anti-Mass\" (2005), using charcoal from a black congregation church in Kentucky, which had been destroyed by arson. Hanging Fire (Suspected Arson) (1999) is another example of Parker's suspended sculptures, featuring charred remains of an actual case of suspected arson.\nThe Maybe (1995) at the Serpentine Gallery, London, was a performance piece conceived by Tilda Swinton, who lay, apparently asleep, inside a vitrine. She asked Parker to collaborate with her on the project, and to create an installation in which she could sleep. Swinton's original idea was to lie in state as Snow White in a glass coffin, but through the collaboration with Parker the idea evolved into her appearing as herself and not as an actor posing as a fictional character.  Parker filled the Serpentine with glass cases containing relics that belonged to famous historical figures, such as the pillow and blanket from Freud's couch, Mrs. Simpson's ice skates, Charles Dickens' quill pen and Queen Victoria's stocking. A version of the piece was later re-performed in Rome (1996) and then MoMA, New York (2013) without Parker's involvement.\nAvoided Object is an ongoing series of smaller works which have been developed in liaison with various institutions, including the Royal Armouries, British Police Forces, Colt Firearms and Madame Tussauds. \nParker has made other interventions involving historical artworks. In 1998 in her solo show at the Serpentine Gallery she exhibited the backs of Turner paintings (Room for Margins) as works in their own right, she wrapped Rodin's The Kiss sculpture in Tate Britain with a mile of string (2003) as her contribution to the 2003 Tate Triennial Days Like These at Tate Britain. The intervention was titled The Distance (A Kiss With String Attached). She re-staged this piece as part of her mid-career retrospective at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, in 2015 and at Tate Britain in 2022. \nSubconscious of a Monument (2005) is composed of fragments of dry soil, which are suspended on wires from the gallery ceiling. These lumps are the now-desiccated clay which was removed from beneath the Leaning Tower of Pisa in order to prevent its collapse.\n\nThese \"avoided\" objects have often had their identities transformed by being burned, shot, squashed, stretched, drawn, exploded, cut, or simply dropped off cliffs.  Cartoon deaths have long held a fascination for Parker: \"Tom being run over by a steamroller or Jerry riddled with bullet holes. Sometimes the object's demise has been orchestrated, or it may have occurred accidentally or by natural causes. They might be 'preempted' objects that have not yet achieved a fully formed identity, having been plucked prematurely from the production line like Embryo Firearms 1995. They may not even be classified as objects: things like cracks, creases, shadows, dust or dirt The Negative of Whispers 1997: Earplugs made with fluff gathered in the Whispering Gallery, St Paul's Cathedral). Or they might be those territories you want to avoid psychologically, such as the backs, underbellies or tarnished surfaces of things.\"\nAnother example of this work is Pornographic Drawings (1997),  using ink made by the artist who used solvent to dissolve (pornographic) video tape, confiscated by HM Customs and Excise.\n\nI resurrect things that have been killed off... My work is all about the potential of materials \u2014 even when it looks like they've lost all possibilities.\nIn 2009, for the opening of Jupiter Artland, a sculpture park near Edinburgh, Parker created a firework display titled Nocturne: A Moon Landing containing a lunar meteorite. Therefore, the moon \"landed on Jupiter\". The following year Parker made Landscape with Gun and Tree for Jupiter Artland, a nine-metre-tall cast iron and Corten steel shotgun leaning against a tree. It was inspired by the painting Mr and Mrs Andrews by Thomas Gainsborough, where Mr Andrews poses with a gun slung over his arm. The shotgun used in the piece is a facsimile of the one owned by Robert Wilson, one of the founders of Jupiter Artland.\n\nFor the Folkestone Triennial in 2011, Parker created The Folkestone Mermaid, her version of one of the popular tourist attractions in Copenhagen, The Little Mermaid. Through a process of open submission, Parker chose Georgina Baker, 38 year old mother of two, Folkestone born and bred. Unlike the idealised Copenhagen version, this is a life-size, life-cast sculpture, celebrating womankind.\n\nTo celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, Parker created Magna Carta (An Embroidery), a hand-embroidered representation of the Wikipedia article Magna Carta as it was on 15 June 2014, completed in 2015. Embroiderers included members of the Embroiderers Guild, HM prisoners, Peers, MP's, judges, human rights lawyers, a US ambassador and his staff, and various public figures including Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Jimmy Wales, Jarvis Cocker and Doreen Lawrence.\nWhilst Magna Carta (An Embroidery) was on display at the British Library, Parker presented One More Time, a Terrace Wires commission for St Pancras International Station, London, co-presented by HS1 Ltd. and the Royal Academy of Arts.\nIn 2016 Parker became the first female artist to be commissioned to create a new work for the Roof Garden of the Met in New York. Transitional Object (PsychoBarn) is a scaled-down replica of the house from the 1960 Hitchcock film \u201cPsycho\u201d and was constructed using a salvaged red barn.\nParker continued her work as a curator for the Found exhibition for The Foundling Museum, which incorporated sixty-eight artists from an array of creative disciplines, as well as contributing her own piece, A Little Drop of Gin. This limited-edition print, nicknamed 'mother's ruin', was a photogravure using a 1750s gin glass and droppings of gin. Parker was named Artist of the Year in the 2016 Apollo Awards for her involvement and contributions in the art world.\nParker appeared in the BBC Four television series What Do Artists Do All Day?, a BBC Scotland production, first broadcast in 2013. In the programme she talks about her life and work. In May 2015, Parker was included in the Brilliant Ideas series broadcast by Bloomberg TV in which she reveals her inspirations and discusses some of her best-loved works. In summer 2016, BBC One broadcast \"Danger! Cornelia Parker\" as part of the TV series Imagine. In autumn 2016 she was included in Gaga for Dada, a programme to mark the 100th anniversary of Dada, presented by Vic Reeves. She also contributed to the BBC Four production Bricks! broadcast on 21 September 2016, marking the 40th anniversary of Carl Andre's sculpture Equivalent VIII, better known as 'The Tate Bricks'.\nOn 1 May 2017 Parker was chosen as the official election artist for the 2017 United Kingdom general election; she was the first woman to take on that role.\nIn 2017, Parker made a series of blackboard drawings with the collaboration of 5- to 10-year-old schoolchildren from Torriano Primary School. The children were asked by the artist to copy out news headlines collected from various UK and US newspapers. 'At that age, children have a barely formed view of the news and world affairs - they don't yet have a vote, but the political turmoil unfolding in their young lives will have a profound effect on their futures'.\nIn November 2019 Parker opened her first major retrospective exhibition in Australia at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney for the Tenth Sydney International Art Series.\nIn May 2022 Parkerexhibited 100 artworks at Tate Britain in her largest solo exhibition to date. She showed several of her films, Chomskian Abstract 2007, Made in Bethlehem 2012, War Machine 2015, American Gothic 2016, Left, Right & Centre 2017, Election Abstract 2018, Thatcher\u2019s Finger 2018 and Flag 2022\nIn May 2023, her photograph \"Snap\" was used as the cover artwork for the Peter Gabriel song \"Four Kinds of Horses\".\nIn November 2024, Parker's glass rendition of the chandelier featured in Van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait was suspended in the Procuratie Vecchie in  St Mark's Square, Venice. This work was created as part of Murano Illumina il Mondo (\u201cMurano Lights Up the World\u201d) and was the first time in living memory that artworks were permitted to be displayed in the colonnade\n\n\n== Curatorial ==\nIn 2011 Parker curated an exhibition titled Richard Of York Gave Battle In Vain for the Collections Gallery at the Whitechapel Gallery in London using selected works from the Government Art Collection arranged as a colour spectrum.\nFor the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 2014, Parker curated the Black and White Room which included a number of well-known artists who she thought should be future Royal Academicians.\nIn 2016, as part of her Hogarth Fellowship at the Foundling Museum, Parker curated a group exhibition titled FOUND presenting works from over sixty artists from a range of creative disciplines, asked to respond to the theme of \u2018found\u2019, reflecting on the museum's heritage.\n\n\n== Honours and recognition ==\nIn 2010 Parker was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts, London and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In 2000, 2005 and 2008 and 2017 she received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Gloucestershire and Manchester respectively.\nParker won the Artist of the Year Apollo Award in 2016. Other shortlisted artists were Carmen Herrera, David Hockney, Ragnar Kjartansson, Jannis Kounellis and Helen Marten.\nParker was named the official Election Artist for the 2017 general election in the United Kingdom. In this role she observed the election campaign leading up to the vote on 8 June, and was required to produce a piece of art in response. Parker created two films and a series of 14 photographic works as a result of this commission, which were previewed on BBC Newsnight on 2 February 2018 and made available online via the UK Parliament website prior to an exhibition in Westminster Hall.\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to the arts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn politics, prior to the 2015 general election, she was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArt of the United Kingdom\nBook Works\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nTate: Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View\nTate: Cornelia Parker: Talking Art Cornelia Parker interviewed by writer and curator Lisa LeFeuvre.

She is a MacArthur Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellow (1974).\nSnyder first gained public attention in the early 1970s with her gestural and elegant \"stroke paintings,\" which used the grid to deconstruct and retell the story of abstract painting. By the late seventies, Snyder had abandoned the formality of the grid. She began more explicitly incorporating symbols and text, as the paintings took on a more complex materiality. These early works were included in the 1973 and 1981 Whitney Biennials and the 1975 Corcoran Biennial.\nOften referred to as an autobiographical or confessional artist, Snyder's paintings are narratives of both personal and communal experiences. Through a fiercely individual approach and persistent experimentation with technique and materials, Snyder has extended the expressive potential of abstract painting, inspiring generations of emerging artists.\nSnyder currently lives and works in Brooklyn and Woodstock, New York.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJoan Snyder was born on April 16, 1940, in Highland Park, New Jersey.  She received her BA in Sociology, from Douglass College in 1962 and her MFA from Rutgers University in 1966.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1969, Snyder married photographer Larry Fink. She gave birth to their daughter, Molly, in 1979. They were divorced in 1985. Her grandson Elijah was born in 2012.\nIn 2011, Snyder married her partner of 28 years, Margaret Cammer,  a retired New York State Acting Supreme Court Judge and the former NY Deputy Administrative Judge of The New York City Civil Court.\n\n\n== Work ==\nWhile living on a New Jersey farm in 1962, Snyder worked in a studio on the Raritan River in New Brunswick, creating some of her earliest paintings of farm and landscape scenes, as well as expressionist portraits. In the mid to late 60's she was working explicitly with the idea of female sensibility, using materials in her paintings such as lentil seeds, flocking, thread, glitter and gauze. Snyder describes her processes involving non-art materials as a type of ritual act for the painting. Snyder's ideas often take form in her paintings through other means other than paint such as music, poetry and words to further push the intent of her pieces. These works eventually led to Snyder's seminal stroke paintings in the late 60's and early '70's.  Snyder worked alongside artists such as Mary Heilmann, Jennifer Bartlett and Harriet Korman during the 1960s, all of whom were attempting to bring more process into their art making.\n\n\n== Stroke paintings ==\n\nIn the early 1970s, Snyder began to explore paint as subject, reconstructing abstract painting through gestural strokes on canvas over a gridded background. These paintings, more commonly known as her 'stroke' paintings, were included in the 1973 and 1981 Whitney Biennials as well as the Corcoran Biennial in 1975.\nFollowing the stroke paintings in the mid 70s, Snyder's work once again revisited female sensibility and the work more vigorously explored materiality. By the late 70s she abandoned the formality of the grid and began to more explicitly incorporate symbols and text in her paintings.\n\n\n== The feminist movement ==\nIn 1971, Snyder founded the Mary H. Dana Women Artist Series, \"the oldest continuous running exhibition space in the United States dedicated to making visible the work of emerging and established contemporary women artists.\"\nShe was a founding member of Heresies, a Feminist Publication On Art and Politics, alongside artists and critics including Ida Applebroog, Joyce Kozloff, Lucy Lippard, Nina Yankowitz, Joan Braderman, Sue Heinemann and Miriam Schapiro, among many others.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nSnyder is the recipient of a 1974 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, a 1983 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, a 2007 MacArthur Fellowship, and a 2016 Arts & Letters Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts & Letters.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nSnyder's work can be found in many public collections including:\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL\nBrooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY\nDallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX\nGuggenheim Museum, New York, NY\nHarvard Art Museums, Cambridge, MA\nHigh Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA\nThe Jewish Museum, New York, NY\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\nNational Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC\nNeuberger Museum, State University of New York at Purchase, NY\nThe Phillips Collection, Washington, DC\nRose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham MA\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA\nSmith College Museum of Art, Northampton, MA\nSpeed Art Museum, Louisville, KY\nTang Museum, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY\nTate Modern, London, England\nUniversity of Arizona Museum of Art, Tucson, AZ\nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, VA\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY\nWichita Art Museum, Wichita, KS\nZimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJoan Snyder Website\nJoan Snyder at ArtCyclopedia\nJoan Snyder at Artnet\nInterview with Phong Bui\nOral history interview with Joan Snyder, 2010 February 25-26, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution", "Karen Kilimnik (born 1955) is an American painter and installation artist.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nKaren traveled through much of the United States and Canada as a young child. She often spoke of Russell, Manitoba as being an inspiration for her later works. Karen Kilimnik studied at Temple University, Philadelphia.\nHer installations reflected a young viewpoint of pop culture. An example of this work is her 1989 breakout The Hellfire Club Episode of the Avengers, which is composed of photocopied images, clothing, drawings, and other objects that reverentially embody the glamour, risk, and mod kitsch of the 1960s television show. The work exemplified the \u201cscatter\u201d style of her installations.\nKilimnik's paintings, characterised by loose brushwork, bold colors and \"thrift shop paint-by-numbers awkwardness\", are pastiches of the Old Masters and often incorporate portraits of celebrities. In contrast to the celebrity portraits of Elizabeth Peyton, Kilimnik, \"blends together Conceptual and performance art and 1980's appropriation with the current interest in female psychology and identity.\"\nJonathan Jones described her portrait of Hugh Grant (1997) as \"a nice example of a relatively new genre of painting, which we might call the iconic portrait, not commissioned by its sitter but based on photographs, magazine cuttings, film clips.\"\nHer work is variously described as \"sharp and witty...an interesting exercise in conceptual control\" and as \"wan and whimsical...\"\n\n\n== Collections ==\nKilimnik's has work in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nKaren Kilimnik (ed.

Rego's style evolved from abstract towards representational, and she favoured pastels over oils for much of her career. Her work often reflects feminism, coloured by folk-themes from her native Portugal.\nRego studied at the Slade School of Fine Art and was an exhibiting member of The London Group, along with David Hockney and Frank Auerbach. In 1989 she became the second artist-in-residence, after the scheme re-started, at the National Gallery in London, after Jock McFadyen, who was the first in 1981. She lived and worked in London.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nRego was born on 26 January 1935 in Lisbon, Portugal. Her father was an electrical engineer who worked for the Marconi Company and was ardently anti-fascist. Her mother was a competent artist but, as a conventional Portuguese woman from the early 20th century, gave her daughter no encouragement towards a career, even though she began drawing at age 4. The family was divided in 1936 when her father was posted to work in the United Kingdom. Rego's parents left her behind in Portugal in the care of her grandmother until 1939. Rego's grandmother was to become a significant figure in her life, as she learned from her grandmother and the family maid many of the traditional folktales that would one day make their way into her art work.\nRego's family were keen Anglophiles, and Rego was sent to the only English-language school in the Lisbon area at the time, Saint Julian's School in Carcavelos, which she attended from 1945 to 1951. St Julian's School was Anglican and this, combined with the hostility of Rego's father to the Roman Catholic Church, served to create a distance between Rego and full-blooded Roman Catholic belief, although she was nominally a Roman Catholic and lived in a devoutly Roman Catholic country. Rego described herself as having become a \"sort of Catholic\", but as a child she possessed a sense of Catholic guilt and a very strong belief that the Devil was real.\n\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1951, Rego was sent to the United Kingdom to attend a finishing school called The Grove School, in Sevenoaks, Kent. Unhappy there, Rego attempted in 1952 to start studies in art at the Chelsea School of Art in London, but was advised against this choice by her legal guardian in Britain, David Phillips, who had heard that a young woman had become pregnant while a student there. He suggested to her parents that the Slade School of Fine Art was a more respectable choice and helped her achieve a place there. From 1952 to 1956, she attended the Slade School.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nAlthough Rego was commissioned by her father to produce a series of large-scale murals to decorate the works' canteen at his electrical factory in 1954, while she was still a student, Rego's artistic career effectively began in early 1962, when she began exhibiting with The London Group, a long-established artists' organization, which had David Hockney and Frank Auerbach among its members. In 1965, she was selected to take part in a group show, Six Artists, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. That same year she had her first solo show at the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes (SNBA) in Lisbon. She was also the Portuguese representative at the 1969 S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial. Between 1971 and 1978 she had seven solo shows in Portugal, in Lisbon and Porto, and then a series of solo exhibitions in Britain, including at the AIR Gallery in London in 1981, the Arnolfiniin Bristol in 1983, and the Edward Totah Gallery in London in 1984, 1985 and 1987.\nIn 1988, Rego was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon and the Serpentine Gallery in London. This led to her being invited to become the first Associate Artist at the National Gallery, London, in 1990, in what was the first of a series of artist-in-residence schemes organized by the gallery. From this emerged two sets of work. The first was a series of paintings and prints on the theme of nursery rhymes, which was taken around Britain and elsewhere by the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council from 1991 to 1996. The second was a series of large-scale paintings inspired by the paintings of Carlo Crivelli in the National Gallery, known as Crivelli's Garden which have been housed in the main restaurant at the gallery prior to its temporary shutting to allow for the renovation works planned to renew the Sainsbury Wing in celebration of the National Gallery's bicentenary in 2024.\nIn 1995, Rego used pastels to revise the story of Snow White in her drawing Swallows the Poisoned Apple. In her work, Snow White is pictured after she has eaten the poisoned apple and appears older and in some type of physical pain. She \"lays clutching her skirts, as if trying to cling to life and her femininity which are slipping away\". This was done to show what a female goes through during the processes of life and ageing over the years, as well as showing the \"physical and psychological violation\" age plays in a female's life. At the time the artwork was made, Rego was about 60 years old and her age did play a significant part in this artwork.\nOther exhibitions included a retrospective at Tate Liverpool in 1997, Dulwich Picture Gallery in 1998, Tate Britain in 2005, and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2007. A major retrospective of her work was held at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid in 2007, which travelled to the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., the following year.\nIn 2008, Rego exhibited at the Marlborough Chelsea in New York, and staged a retrospective of her graphic works at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in N\u00eemes, France. As well as her showing at Marlborough Fine Art in London in 2010, the art historian Marco Livingstone organised a retrospective of her work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Monterrey, Mexico, which was later shown at the Pinacoteca de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. In 2011, Rego appeared in the documentary Looking for Lowry with Ian McKellen as an interviewee, commenting on her experience with Lowry at the Slade School of Fine Art.\nRego was commissioned by the Royal Mail in 2004 to produce a set of Jane Eyre stamps.\nIn March 2017, Rego was the subject of the BBC documentary Paula Rego, Secrets & Stories, directed by her son Nick Willing.\nRego's work was included in the 2022 exhibition Women Painting Women at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. In 2023 some of her art was exhibited at the Pera Museum in Istanbul.\nAt the time of her death, Rego was represented by the Victoria Miro Gallery and the Cristea Roberts Gallery. Her work can be seen in many public and private institutions around the world. There are 43 of her works in the collection of the British Council, ten works in the collection of the Arts Council of England, and 48 works at the Tate Gallery, London.\n\n\n=== Women's rights and abortion ===\nRego spent much of her career focusing on women's rights and abortion rights. A critic of the anti-abortion movement, she used  the theme of abortion as a focal point in much of her art. Rego opposed the criminalisation of abortion and said that the anti-abortion movement \"criminalises women\" and in some instances will force women to find potentially deadly \"backstreet solutions\". She also stated that it disproportionately affected poor women, as it was easier for the rich to find a safe abortion (irrespective of the law) because they could afford to travel abroad for the procedure.\nRego created an art series called Untitled: The Abortion Pastels documenting illegal abortions in response to Portugal's 1998 referendum on abortion. She began the series of ten pastels in July 1998, completing it over the approximately six months up to February 1999. The referendum aimed to legalise abortions although the law was not passed. Rego expressed a feeling of rage, pointing out the \"total hypocrisy\" of the outcome. The pastels show images of women in positions such as fetal, squatting, etc., either getting ready to have an abortion, in the process of having one, or in pain from the procedure. In a 2002 interview Rego stated:\n\"The series was born from my indignation\u2026 It is unbelievable that women who have an abortion should be considered criminals. It reminds me of the past\u2026 I cannot abide the idea of blame in relation to this act. What each woman suffers in having to do it is enough. But all this stems from Portugal's totalitarian past, from women dressed up in aprons, baking cakes like good housewives. In democratic Portugal today there is still a subtle form of oppression\u2026 The question of abortion is part of all that violent context.\"\nThe paintings were published in several Portuguese newspapers before a second referendum on abortion in 2007, which reversed the 1998 result; it is thought that the paintings significantly affected the result.\nRego used two typical tropes of Western art history: \"the gaze\" and \"the reclining nude\". She utilised \"the gaze\" in conscious ways to challenge the viewer by having the woman or girl look directly at the viewer or away in agony or closing her eyes in pain. The \"reclining nude\" brings up the push and pull between sexual attraction, the act of sex and the physical outcomes like pregnancy and miscarriage that occur as a result of sex.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\n\nAt the Slade School of Fine Art, Rego began an affair with fellow student Victor Willing, who was already married to another artist, Hazel Whittington. Rego had many abortions during their affair, starting from when she was 18 years old, because Willing had threatened to return to his wife if Rego kept their child.\nIn 1957, Rego left the UK to live in Ericeira in Portugal because she had decided to keep their latest baby. After the birth of their first child, Willing joined her there. They were able to marry in 1959 following Willing's divorce from his wife. Rego had two daughters, Caroline 'Cas' Willing and Victoria Willing, and a son, Nick Willing, with Victor Willing. Nick is a film-maker, who directed a television film, Paula Rego, Secrets & Stories, about his mother in 2017. The Australian sculptor Ron Mueck is her son-in-law.\nIn 1962,  Rego's father bought the couple a house in London, at Albert Street in Camden Town, and Rego's time was spent divided between Britain and Portugal. Her husband had several extra-marital affairs throughout their marriage, and some of his mistresses were depicted in Rego's drawings.\nIn 1966, Rego's father died, and the family electrical business was taken over by Rego's husband, Victor, although he had himself been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, had no experience of electrical engineering or management, and spoke only limited Portuguese. Victor's heavy drinking had worried his father-in-law, who had advised the couple to sell the business after his death and return to England. The company failed in 1974 following the Carnation Revolution that overthrew the country's right-wing Estado Novo dictatorship, when its production works were taken over by revolutionary forces although Rego's family had been supporters of the political Left. In response Rego, Willing and their children moved permanently to London and spent most of their time there until Willing's death in 1988.\nRego was a supporter of the football club S.L. Benfica, of which her grandfather was a founding member.\nShe died after a short illness on 8 June 2022 at the age of 87 and was buried with Victor Willing in Hampstead Cemetery.\n\n\n== Style and influences ==\nRego was a prolific painter and printmaker, and in earlier years also produced collage work. Her well-known depictions of folk tales and images of young girls, made largely since 1990, brought together methods of painting and printmaking that emphasised strong, clearly drawn forms, in contrast to the looser style of her earlier paintings.\nIn her earliest works, such as Always at Your Excellency's Service, painted in 1961, Rego was strongly influenced by Surrealism, and particularly the work of Joan Mir\u00f3. This shows itself not only in the type of imagery that appears in these works, but in the method employed, which is based on the Surrealist idea of automatic drawing, in which the artist attempts to disengage the conscious mind from the drawing process in order to allow the unconscious mind to direct the making of an image. At times these paintings verged on abstraction. However, as exemplified by Salazar Vomiting the Homeland, painted in 1960, when Portugal's right-wing dictator Salazar was in power, even when her work veered toward abstraction, a strong narrative element remained in place.\nThere are two principal reasons why Rego adopted a semi-abstract style in the 1960s. First, abstraction dominated in avant-garde artistic circles at the time, which had set figurative art on the defensive. But Rego was also reacting against her training at the Slade School of Art, where there had been a very strong emphasis on anatomical figure drawing. Under the encouragement of her fellow student and later husband Victor Willing while at the Slade, Rego kept alongside her official school sketchbooks a \"secret sketchbook\" in which she made free-form drawings that would have been frowned upon by her tutors. Rego's dislike of crisp drawing techniques in the 1960s revealed itself not only in the style of such works as Faust and her Red Monkey series of the 1980s, which resembled expressionistic comic-book drawing, but in her acknowledged influences at the time, which included Jean Dubuffet and Cha\u00efm Soutine.\nA notable change in Rego's style emerged in 1990, following her appointment as the first Associate Artist of the National Gallery in London in what was effectively an artist-in-residence scheme. Her remit was to \"make new work that in some way connects to the National Gallery Collection.\" The National Gallery is overwhelmingly an Old Masters collection and Rego seems to have been pulled back towards a much clearer, or tighter, linear style reminiscent of the highly-wrought drawing technique that she was taught at the Slade. The result was a series of works that came to characterise the popular perception of her style, combining strong clear drawing with depictions of equally strong women in sometimes disturbing situations. Works such as Crivelli's Garden had clear links to the paintings by Carlo Crivelli in the National Gallery, but other works made at the time, such as Joseph's Dream and The Fitting, drew from works by Old Masters such as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, in terms of subject matter and spatial representation.\n\nRego gave up working with collage in the late 1970s, and began using pastels as a medium in the early 90s. She continued to use pastels up to her death, almost to the exclusion of oil paint. Among her most notable works in pastel were those in her Dog Women series, in which women were shown sitting, squatting, scratching, and generally behaving as if they were dogs, the antithesis of what is considered feminine behaviour. Paula Rego challenges traditional female depictions by illustrating women in their natural state of strength and power, showing the reality of womanhood rather than trying to satisfy the gaze of the viewer. Rego embraces sensational behaviors that aren\u2019t necessarily considered to be feminine by social constructs, yet all people experience this humanistic feeling. The Dog Women series acts on the beauty of vulnerability, focusing on the raw aggression of erotic vitality that women have been restrained from outwardly expressing. Using pastels for an immense piece of work, Rego manipulates her medium by physically casting her emotional intensity as oil pastels allow her to showcase her violent passion. This and others of her works in which there appeared to be either the threat of female violence or its actual manifestation caused Rego to be associated with feminism. She acknowledged having read Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, a key feminist text, at a young age, and that this had made a deep impression on her. Her work also seemed to chime with the interest in Freudian criticism shown by feminist writers on art in the 1990s, such as Griselda Pollock, with works such as Girl Lifting up her Skirt to a Dog of 1986 and Two Girls and a Dog of 1987 appearing to have disturbing sexual undertones. However, Rego was known to rebuke critics who read too much sexual content into her work. Another explanation for her depiction of women as unfeminine, animalistic or brutal beings is that this reflected the reality of women as human beings in the physical world, rather than the idealised female type in the minds of men.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Exhibition catalogues ===\nIl Exposi\u00e7ao de Artes Plasticas, Funda\u00e7ao Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon (1961).\nPaula Rego, Funda\u00e7ao Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, (1961).\nde Lacerda, Alberto.

She has exhibited widely since the late 1980s and her work has been included in a number of seminal exhibitions including Documenta IX and Documenta XII, and the 1993, 1997 and 2014 Whitney biennials. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2020.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLeonard was born in 1961 in Liberty, New York. Leonard's mother was a Polish refugee who was born in Warsaw, immigrating to America at the age of 9 during World War II and later worked for an airline. Her mother's family were wealthy members of the Polish aristocracy who were involved in the movement for Polish independence and the Polish Resistance. Many members of Leonard's maternal line were killed during the war. Despite being non-Jews, her mother's family was persecuted by the Nazis for their opposition to Nazism and their Polish nationalism. Leonard has stated that her grandmother \"was really invested in this idea that we were still aristocracy\", although her family was living in poverty in Harlem. As a teenager, she moved to the Lower East Side and attended the City-As-School High School in Manhattan, but dropped out at the age of sixteen and began taking photographs using her mother's camera. She has spent most of her adult life living in New York City, whose built environment has been the subject matter of much of her work (e.g. sidewalks, storefronts, apartment buildings, chain-link fencing, graffiti, and boarded-up windows.) Leonard became well known internationally following her installation at Documenta IX in 1992.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrom her earliest aerial photographs to her images of museum displays, anatomical models, and fashion shows, much of Leonard's work reflects on the framing, classifying, and ordering of vision. She explained in an interview: \"Rather than any one subject or genre (landscape, portrait, still life, etc), I was, and remain, interested in engaging a simultaneous questioning of both subject and vantage point, the relation between viewer and world \u2014 in short, subjectivity and how it informs our experience of the world.\"\n\nLeonard was active in AIDS advocacy and queer politics in New York in the 1980s and 1990s, and was a member of ACT UP as well as the Women's Action Coalition. In 1992 she wrote \"I want a president\", a poem inspired by Eileen Myles's run for president. In 2016, a large mural of the poem was installed in front of the Standard Hotel along the High Line. Leonard's sculptural works demonstrate her eye for detail and her ability to provoke thought and emotion. \"Strange Fruit,\" for instance, consists of 300 fruit skins that were consumed and then stitched back together, offering a powerful commentary on AIDS, mourning, and reminiscing on what once was. \n\nIn 1995 she staged an exhibition at her studio on the Lower East Side of Manhattan which featured the work Strange Fruit, an installation of various fruit skins (oranges, bananas, grapefruits, lemons) that Leonard saved and then sewed together by hand with wire and thread. Strange Fruit is dedicated to the friend of Leonard and a fellow artist, David Wojnarowicz, who died in 1992. It grew out of a deeply personal response to the losses of the AIDS epidemic and as a meditation on mourning, it became a seminal work of the 1990s. Strange Fruit was exhibited in 1998 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where it currently resides.\nDuring the mid-1990s Leonard spent two years living and working in Eagle, Alaska, an experience that influenced much of her later artwork, which often foregrounds relationships between humans and the natural world. While in Alaska, she worked on a farm, a commercial fishing boat, and for the National Park Service, and went on to create a photographic series, Hunting, based on her experiences with subsistence economies.Trees are also a motif in Leonard's work: examples include a \"reconstructed\" tree that she installed in Vienna's Secession in 1997 as well as numerous photographs of urban trees mangled in chain-link and razor wire fences.\nLeonard began working on the Fae Richards Photo Archive in 1993 after being approached by director Cheryl Dunye to create a fictive archive of photographs for Dunye's 1996 fictional documentary The Watermelon Woman, in which protagonist Cheryl, played by Dunye, searches for the history of black lesbian entertainer Fae Richards. The photographs, which Leonard treated by hand to appear aged, are used as props in the film and were included in the 1997 Whitney Biennial.\nBetween 1998 and 2009, Leonard worked on Analogue, a monumental project consisting of an installation of 412 C-prints and gelatin silver prints (in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Reina Sofia, Madrid), and a portfolio of 40 dye-transfer prints. Influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Atget and Walker Evans but born out of a 21st-century reconsideration of the role of photography, Analogue explores transformations in global labor, trade, and social relationships in parallel with the shift from analogue to digital image-making. Holland Cotter described an experience of the work in The New York Times in 2009:\n\"In her straight-ahead photographs of storefronts, an arrangement of shoes or shrink-wrapped furniture becomes a vanitas still life. A hand-painted shop sign becomes a relic. Over several photographs, we sense that an unnamed neighborhood \u2014 Ms. Leonard expanded her field work to include East Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights \u2014 is packing up to leave. A city's material culture is doing a vanishing act. And where is the material going? Back to a version of the world it came from. Many of the cut-rate goods sold in the Lower East Side shops originated in urban sweatshops in China and Pakistan and are eventually passed on as surplus to other poor cities in Africa and Central America. In the wraparound grid of pictures in Analogue we follow recycled clothes from Brooklyn to the city of Kampala in Uganda, where they are sold as new in stores like the Money Is Life House of Garments.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nAnalogue was first exhibited in 2007 at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and at Documenta XII in Kassel, Germany, followed by presentations at Villa Arson in Nice, and Dia at the Hispanic Society and the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was included in a touring retrospective of Leonard's work which originated in 2007 at the Fotomuseum Winterthur, and later traveled to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; MuMOK \u2014 Museum Moderner Kunst Stifting Ludwig, Vienna; and Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich. Analogue is in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Reina Sofia, Madrid.\nMore recent exhibitions have included You See I Am Here After All at Dia: Beacon (2009) which featured a set of 3883 postcards of waterfalls, primarily Niagara Falls, and reminiscent of Yokoo Tadanori's Waterfall Rapture collection of 13,000 waterfall postcards, one of which carries the phrase \"You See I Am Here After All\" which critic Jonathan Flatley connects to the work of On Kawara's telegrams which read \"I AM STILL ALIVE\" This work was also exhibited at the Whitney in Leonard's 2018 retrospective. Other exhibitions such as Serialities at Hauser & Wirth, Observation Point Archived 2014-01-02 at the Wayback Machine, Camden Arts Centre, London (2012), an installation at the Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas (2013-2014) and the 2014 Whitney Biennial, for which Leonard won the Bucksbaum Award with her work \"945 Madison Avenue\". In 2018, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted Leonard's first career retrospective in the United States, an exhibition organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, where the show traveled in late 2018.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nTexts by Leonard, an insightful writer and a pre-eminent thinker on the discipline of photography, have appeared in LTTR, October, and Texte zur Kunst, and in recent monographs on Agnes Martin, James Castle and Josiah McElheny.\nIn addition to working on her art, Leonard has been serving on the advisory board of the Hauser & Wirth Institute since 2018. She was also a member of the jury that selected Cathy Wilkes as recipient of the inaugural Maria Lassnig Prize in 2017. Leonard is a founding member of the artist collective, fierce pussy, along with Joy Episalla, Carrie Yamaoka, and Nancy Brooks Brody. She works out of a study in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\nLeonard has taught at Bard College, and served as the co-chair of the photography department for the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts from 2011 to 2015.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n1991 \u2013 Information: Zoe Leonard (with text by Jutta Koether), Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne | ASIN B005MJ5M9I\n1995 \u2013 Strange Fruit, Paula Cooper Gallery, NY | ASIN B0006PFWNY\n1997 \u2013 Zoe Leonard, Kunsthalle Basel, Basel\n1997 \u2013 Zoe Leonard, (with an interview by Anna Blume), Secession, Vienna\n1998 \u2013 Zoe Leonard, (with text by Elisabeth Lebovici), Centre national de la photographie, Paris\n2007 \u2013 Analogue, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH, MIT Press | ISBN 978-0262122955\n2008 \u2013 Zoe Leonard: Photographs (with texts by Svetlana Alpers, Elisabeth Lebovici, Urs Stahel), Fotomuseum Winterthur, Steidl | ISBN 978-3865214942\n2010 \u2013 You See I Am Here After All (with texts by Ann Reynolds, Angela Miller, Lytle Shaw, and Lynne Cooke), Dia Art Foundation, New York; Yale University Press, New Haven, CT and London, UK | ISBN 978-0300151688\n2014 \u2013 Available Light, Ridinghouse / Dancing Foxes, London, UK and Brooklyn\n2017 \u2013 I want a president: Transcript of a Rally (with contributions by Sharon Hayes, Wu Tsang, Mel Elberg, Eileen Myles, Pamela Sneed, Fred Moten & Stefano Harney, Alexandro Segade, Layli Long Soldier, Malik Gaines, and Justin Vivian Bond & Nath Ann Carrera), Dancing Foxes Press | ISBN 978-0300151688\n2018 \u2013 Zoe Leonard: Survey, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles | ISBN 978-3791357317\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nLeonard was awarded the Bucksbaum Prize in 2014 from the Whitney Museum and the Anonymous was a Woman Award in 2005.

As his figural based paintings evolved to include geometrics, in 2010, Ramirez coined the term \"biogeomorphic abstraction\" to describe his own bold painting style, a fusion of biomorphic and geometric forms. He also gained notability for his site-specific installations as his paintings began to expand outside the confines of the canvas edges onto the walls of the gallery space. These site-specific installations gradually evolved to encompass the whole gallery space, creating a full environmental experience. Donald Kuspit, scholar and art critic, describes Ramirez as \u201can important new kind of abstract painter . . . an abstractionist playing with color and form to exciting imaginative effect.\u201d\n\n\n== Work ==\nRamirez began creating site-specific installations in 1994, combining drawings, paintings, objects, sculpture, music, dance, and furniture in dialogue with architectural space and architectural elements, sometimes in collaboration with sound designers, dance choreographers, costume designers, and furniture designers. His \"total environments\" are intended to invite viewers to experience in addition to observe, to feel as if \u201cthey are coming into the belly of a painting\u201d as they enter his world \u2014 his installation. These were first featured in New York City alternative exhibition spaces including the Drawing Center (1994), Clock Tower Gallery (1995) and Franklin Furnace (1995); and at Caren Golden Fine Art, New York (1998).\n\n\n== Career ==\nRamirez moved from his native Texas to New Jersey in 1985, then to New York City a few years later to design window and interior displays for retailers Henri Bendel, Charivari, and Takashimaya. In 1994, he set up a studio in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, later moving his studio to the Motor Arts Building studio complex at the Grounds For Sculpture, Hamilton, New Jersey. He is represented by Ryan Lee Gallery, New York.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nRamirez's work can be found in the permanent collections of the Austin Museum of Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Crocker Art Museum, El Paso Museum of Art, Hammer Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, Kresge Art Museum, Newark Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, Tarble Arts Center, The Hyde Collection, and Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPaul Henry Ramirez official website.\nRYAN LEE Gallery official website.", "Stuart Brisley (born 1933) is a British artist.\n\n\n== Education ==\nBrisley studied at Guildford School of Art from 1949 to 1954 and at the Royal College of Art from 1956 to 1959.

In the 1980s, he studied with Victor Burgin, and was a friend of Laura Mulvey in 1981. He began his career as a photographer and from 1989 to 1997 lived in Vancouver, becoming part of the burgeoning photoconceptualism scene of the Vancouver School. In 1991, he produced the documentary Disgraced Monuments with Mulvey. In the mid\u20111990s, he began making film-based installations . His first art film was Two Impossible Films (1995). In 1999, he eliminated sound from his film. His work focuses on the technology of film and the different genres which have developed in over 100 years of film history: he makes films that are often short, precise exercises on particular techniques, particularly rear projection (he believes the invention of rear projection in late 1920s was when film became modern) and playing film backwards. In 2020, he told an interviewer:\n\nThe only real technical invention of the cinema is the ability to go backward.\nIn 2009, he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in Italy in an exhibition curated by Barbara Fischer. He has had solo museum exhibitions at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris (2014), The Power Plant, Toronto (2015), the Art Gallery of Ontario which organized Mark Lewis.

She made the cover image for the November 1975 issue of National Lampoon magazine.\n\n\n=== Public works ===\nIn 1981, Feuerman was chosen by a jury at the Heckscher Museum on Long Island. She exhibited her works at Fordham University and was chosen to participate in the Learning through Arts Program conducted by the Guggenheim Museum.\nIn 1989, Feuerman began to work her first big marketing campaign with Absolut Vodka. Since Sweden did not allow the advertising of alcohol, Absolut Vodka's marketing plan was to push advertising in other areas of the world. Feuerman created life-sized figures within a glass display which were paraded in trucks on the streets of Los Angeles and Manhattan.\nIn 2008, Feuerman was commissioned by artist Seward Johnson and the Sculpture Foundation to create a painted bronze sculpture installation for the permanent collection of Grounds for Sculpture.\nIn May 2012, Feuerman unveiled her monumental sculpture Survival of Serena in painted bronze with New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation.

While attending CCAC, he took an eight-week summer course in painting at Mills College taught by the German Expressionist Max Beckmann.\n\n\n== Teaching ==\nAfter graduation Oliveira taught art at several colleges, including the California College of the Arts, The California School of Fine Arts (now The San Francisco Art Institute), the University of Chicago, UCLA and Stanford University.\n\n1952\u201353 Printmaking Instructor, California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco, CA\n1952-53 Watercolor Instructor, California College of the Arts, Oakland, CA\n1955\u201356 Chair of Graphic Arts, California College of the Arts, Oakland, CA\n1961-62 Visiting Professor in Painting, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL\n1962-63 Visiting Professor in Studio Art, University of California, Los Angeles, CA\n1963-64 Visiting Professor in Studio Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY\n1964\u201396 Professor of Studio Arts, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\nDuring his Stanford years, Oliveira held summer positions as a visiting artist in Colorado and Hawaii.

He felt that his paintings had been also strongly influenced by the work of Willem de Kooning, Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon. Prior to and during his years in art college, he viewed and was influenced by retrospectives of the European Expressionist masters Oskar Kokoschka, Edvard Munch, and Max Beckmann at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum. He once stated: \"I'm not part of the avant-garde. I'm part of the garde that comes afterward, assimilates, consolidates, refines.\"\nOliveira established an early reputation for his depictions of isolated figures painted in an improvisational style. Over time his subjects and style varied tremendously, as he created images of animals, birds of prey, human heads, masks, nudes, and still lifes of fetish objects. Oliveira also developed a series of \"sites\" that told the story of an invented culture with shamanic characteristics.  Most of the artist's paintings are either vividly colored but somber human figures, or abstract expressionist works that vaguely resemble seascapes.  Sea from 1959, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of these almost abstract seascapes.\nDuring his lifetime Oliveira made notable works in a huge range of media, including oil paintings, acrylic paintings on paper, drawings in ink, charcoal and pencil, lithographs, etchings, posters, and sculptures in clay, wax and bronze. Oliveira was especially noted for his work in the monotype medium, in which single printed impressions are made from a painting executed on a metal plate. He was also an accomplished sculptor. A survey of Oliveira's bronzes was held at the Palo Alto Art Center in 2008. His work is in the di Rosa Collection.\n\n\n== Auction record ==\nA 1960 oil painting by Nathan Oliveira, Seated Figure with Pink Background, sold for $317,500 (including buyer's premium) at Sotheby's New York on November 12, 2002.\n\n\n== Windhover Contemplative Center ==\nDuring the 1990s Oliveira worked on a series of paintings of catenary curves based on observation of the flight of birds, including kestrels that had hovered outside the windows of his studio in the Stanford Hills. This series was dubbed the \"Windhover\" series by Oliveira's friend, poet Desmond Egan. He made parallels between the paintings and the 1877 Gerard Manley Hopkins poem \"The Windhover.\"\nIn June 2013 Stanford University started construction of the \"Windhover Contemplative Center,\" a 4,000-square-foot, one-story building to house four paintings from Oliveira's Windhover series. The center, intended to provide Stanford faculty, staff and students with a place to reflect and meditate, was envisioned by Oliveira and his wife Ramona prior to their deaths.\nDesigned by Aidlin Darling Design architects, the Windhover opened on October 9, 2014. It is located in front of Roble Hall. Constructed with rammed earth and wooden walls, the center features three interior rooms to house the Oliveira paintings. Outside landscaping includes a reflection pool and garden areas for meditation. The building is enclosed in glass, allowing for viewing of the Oliveira paintings even from outside. The center is open to the Stanford community daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. A Stanford I.D. card is required to enter.\nDocents from the Cantor Arts Center lead tours for the public on Saturdays. Visitors are asked to refrain from using cell phones, tablets, laptops and other electronic devices while inside the center.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNathan Oliveira died at his home in Stanford, California on November 13, 2010. A memorial service for him was held at Stanford Memorial Church on January 12, 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBay Area Figurative School\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNathan Oliveira: An Oral History, Stanford Historical Society Oral History Program, 2009.\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Berggruen Gallery\nIn Memorian Nathan Oliveira 1928-2010\nNathan Oliveira's Final Visions\nNathan Oliveira (1928-2010\nNY Times obituary\nWindhover Contemplative Center Website", "Ch\u00e9ri Samba or Samba wa Mbimba N\u2019zingo Nuni Masi Ndo Mbasi (born 30 December 1956) is a Congolese painter from the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is one of the best known contemporary African artists, with his works being included in the collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  A large number of his paintings are also found in The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi.  He has been invited to participate in the 2007 Venice Biennale. His paintings almost always include text in French and Lingala, commenting on life in Africa and the modern world. Samba lives in Kinshasa and Paris. \n\n\n== Early life ==\nOriginally, Samba's name was David Samba, but in his country there was a ban on keeping/giving people a Christian first name, so he decided to change it to Samba wa Mbimba N\u2019zingo Nuni Masi Ndo Mbasi. Later on, Samba adopted the name Ch\u00e9ri Samba, which he originally wanted to change to Dessinateur Samba, but didn't because of his relationship with the public. His last name, Samba, has two meanings in the Kikongo language, referring to the act of prayer or the act of being judged.\nSamba's parents were associated with the Kongo culture, but Samba chooses to identify himself with the Kinshasa culture, which is the capital of his country. Samba claims that he was turned into a Catholic, while he attended school. He doesn't reject or deny Christianity, which is the religion he grew up on, but he says he tries to resist any attempt to affix a confession label to his religion. After graduating from primary Catholic school, Samba went to high school. Samba maintained second in class, except for one year where he was first. In his third year, Samba quit. While in school, Samba was always drawing and remembered that his father did not like seeing him draw. Cher\u00ed Samba's religion is Catholic with a Zairian twist, which influenced many of his paintings like Cher\u00ed Samba Beseeches the Cosmos.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nCh\u00e9ri Samba was born in Kinto M\u2019Vuila, Democratic Republic of Congo, as the elder son of a family of 10 children. His father was a blacksmith and his mother a farmer. In 1972, at the age of 16 Samba left the village to find work as a sign painter in the capital of Kinshasa, where he encountered such artists as Mok\u00e9 and Bodo. This group of artists, including Samba's younger brother Cheik Ledy, came to constitute one of the country's most vibrant schools of popular painting.\nIn 1975, Samba opened his own studio.  At the same time he also became an illustrator for the entertainment magazine Bilenge Info. Working both as a billboard painter and a comic-strip artist, he used the styles of both genres when he began making his paintings on sacking cloth.  He borrowed the use of \"word bubbles\" from comic-strip art, which allowed him to add not only narrative but also commentary to his compositions, thus giving him his signature style of combining painting with text. His work earned him some local fame. In 1979 Samba participated in the exhibition Moderne Kunst aus Afrika, organized in West Berlin. The exhibition was part of the program of the first festival Horizonte - Festival der Weltkulturen.\nHe is the central figure in the 1982 documentary film Kin Kiesse, offering his thoughts on life in Kinshasa. According to the film's director, Mwez\u00e9 Ngangura, Samba was instrumental in the making of the film, convincing the French Ministry of Co-operation, France 2 and Congolese television that Ngangura could make a film on Kinshasa.\nSamba's breakthrough was the exhibition Les Magiciens de la Terre at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1989, which made him known internationally.\nIn 2007, curator Robert Storr invited Samba to participate in the 52nd International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale, entitled \"Think with the Senses\u2014Feel with the Mind. Art in the Present Tense\", and described by The Huffington Post as \"certainly  'the exhibition' of this new Century\".\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\nSamba's pieces aims to emphasize poverty, stupidity about his culture, corruption, and chaos in his work. Samba says, \u201cI appeal to people\u2019s consciences\u2026I paint reality even if it\u2019s shocking, I put humor and color into it to attract people. In his piece, J'aime la couleur piece goes into race and self identity\". It explains how Samba believes that experience and process of sustaining and recreating a common identity across the African diaspora will show how to strengthen a community. He usually paints himself at the center of his visual social commentaries.\n\n\n== Similar artists ==\nHieronymus Bosch\nWilliam Kentridge\nCamille-Pierre Pambu Bodo, Bodo\nMok\u00e9\nAbdoulaye Konat\u00e9\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAndr\u00e9 Magnin and Robert Storr, J'aime Cheri Samba, Paris: Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain; London/New York: Thames & Hudson, 2004, ISBN 978-0-500-97014-0.\nFred Robarts, \"Ch\u00e9ri Samba: interview\", Time Out London, 28 March 2007.\nWolfgang Bender [Ed.], Cheri Samba.

In 1990, she became one of the first African-American woman to exhibit at the Venice Biennale. She came to prominence in the 1980s and 1990s with photo-text installations such as Guarded Conditions and Square Deal that questioned the nature of identity, gender, race, history and representation. Simpson continues to explore these themes in relation to memory and history using photography, film, video, painting, drawing, audio, and sculpture.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLorna Simpson was born on August 13, 1960, and grew up in Queens and Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, a Jamaican-Cuban father and African-American mother, took her to numerous plays, museums, concerts and dance performances as a child. Simpson attended the High School of Art and Design and took courses at the Art Institute of Chicago in summer while visiting her grandmother.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPrior to receiving her BFA, Simpson traveled Europe, Africa, and the United States further developing her skills through documentary photography. Simpson attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting in 1982. During that time, she interned at the Studio Museum in Harlem, acquainting herself with the practice of artist in residence David Hammons.\nSimpson earned her Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of California at San Diego in 1985. Her focus was between Photography and Conceptual art, and her teachers included Allan Kaprow, Eleanor Antin, filmmakers Babette Mangolte, Jean-Pierre Gorin and poet David Antin. Here she developed her signature style of combining text with studio-like portraiture, while questioning if documentary photography was factual or served as a constructed truth generated by photographer themselves. These works analyzed stereotypical narratives of African-American women  within American culture.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSimpson was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1985, and in 1990, she became one of the first African-American woman to exhibit at the Venice Biennale. She was also the first African American woman to have a solo exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art with her Projects 23 exhibition. In 1990, Simpson had one woman exhibitions at several major museums, including the Denver Art Museum, the Portland Art Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art. At the same time, her work was included in The Decade Show: Frameworks of Identity in the 1980s, an exhibition presented by The Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, and The Studio Museum in Harlem. \nIn 1997, Simpson received the Artist-in-Residence grant from the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, where she exhibited her works in photography. In 2001, she was awarded the Whitney Museum of Art Award, and in 2007, her work was featured in a 20-year retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in her hometown of New York.\nSimpson's first European retrospective opened at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 2013, then traveled to Germany, England, and Massachusetts. She has been one of a handful of African-American artists to exhibit at the Jamaica Arts Center in Queens, New York and then to the gallery in Soho.\n\nShe first exhibited paintings in 2015 at the 56th Venice Biennale, followed by a showing at the Salon 94 Bowery.\nIn 2016 Simpson created the album artwork for Black America Again by Common. During the same year, she was featured in the book In the Company of Women, Inspiration and Advice from over 100 Makers, Artists, and Entrepreneurs. In a 2017 issue of Vogue Magazine, Simpson showcased a series of portraits of 18 professional creative women who hold art central to their lives. The women photographed included Teresita Fern\u00e1ndez, Huma Bhabha, and Jacqueline Woodson. Inspired by their resilience, Simpson said of these women, \"They don't take no for an answer\".\nSimpson's work is included in the Afrofuturist Period Room exhibition  Before Yesterday We Could Fly at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in the 2022 exhibition Women Painting Women at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.\nWhile she started her career a conceptual photographer, she has since explored video, installation, drawing, painting and film. Simpson's goal is to continue to influence the legacy of black artists by speaking with artists and activists such as the Art Hoe Collective. When asked about her career Simpson says, \"I've always done exactly what I wanted to do, regardless of what was out there. I just stuck to that principle and I'm a much happier person as a result. And I can't imagine trying to satisfy any particular audience\".\n\n\n== Work ==\nSimpson's work often portrays black women combined with text to express contemporary society's relationship with race, ethnicity and sex. In many of her earlier works, the subjects are photographed with obscured faces, causing a denial of gaze and the interaction associated with visual exchange. Simpson's use of \"turned-back figures\" was used to not only \"refuse the gaze\" but to also \"to deny any presumed access to the sitter's personality, and to refute both the classificatory drives and emotional projections typically satisfied by photographic portraiture of black subjects.\" It has also been suggested that these figures \"stand for a generation's mode of looking and questioning photographic representation\" Through repetitive use of the same portrait combined with graphic text, Simpson's \"anti-portraits\" have a sense of scientific classification, addressing the cultural associations of black bodies. Simpson began working in film in 1997 with Call Waiting (1997). Simpson's \"interests in photography [has] always been paralleled by an interest in film, particularly in the way that one structurally builds sequences in film.\" \n\nSimpson's 1989 work, Necklines, shows two circular and identical photographs of a black woman's mouth, chin, neck, and collar bone. The white text, \"ring, surround, lasso, noose, eye, areola, halo, cuffs, collar, loop\", individual words on black plaques, imply menace, binding or worse. The final phrase, text on red \"feel the ground sliding from under you,\" openly suggests lynching, though the adjacent images remain serene, non-confrontational and elegant.\nEasy for Who to Say, Simpson's work from 1989, displays five identical silhouettes of black women from the shoulders up wearing a white top that is similar to women portrayed in other of Simpson's works. The women's faces are obscured by a white-colored oval shape each with one of the following letters inside: A, E, I, O, U. Underneath the corresponding portraits are the words: Amnesia, Error, Indifference, Omission, Uncivil. In this work Simpson alludes to the racialization in ethnographic cinema and the revocation of history faced by many people of color. Also, the letters covering the faces suggest \"intimate multiplicity of positions she might occupy and attitudes she might assume-\", these potential thoughts are stopped, abruptly, by the words, \"undermining not only the subjective position the figure would seek but also her grasp on any recognizable position at all.\"\nIn Simpson's 1989 work Guarded Conditions,she has assembled Polaroid images of a female model. The body is fragmented, viewed from behind, with the back of the model's head in a state of guardedness. Historical and symbolic associations of African-American hairstyles are also brought into play. The message of the text with the formal treatment of the images reinforce a sense of vulnerability. The poses are similar, differing slightly in the placement of feet, hair, and hands. These differences suggest, \"the model's shifting relationship to herself.\" The fragmentation and serialization denies the body\u2019s wholeness and individuality, confronting the viewer with histories of appropriation and consumption of the black female body.Many critics associate the work with the slave auction, as a reminder that black \"enslaved women were removed from the circle of human suffering so that they might become circulating objects of sexual and pecuniary exchange.\" The women become objects, a subject that Simpson often makes the focus of her work.\nSimpson incorporated the complicated relationship that African American women have with their natural hair in her work Wigs (1994). The photographs of wigs, lithographed on felt, range from afros, braids and blonde locks of human, yak and synthetic hair mounted side by side. The work does not include any figures, with the arrangement suggesting scientific specimens. Simpson explains in an interview on Wigs (1994) \u201cThis work came at a point where I wanted to eliminate the figure from\u2014or eliminate its presence from the work, but I still wanted to talk about that presence.\u201d  The Museum of Modern Art describes the work as having social and political undertones about the surrounding culture and the beauty standards that the culture produces. The work forces the viewer to question why such beauty standards exists and how they are perpetuated by society.\n\nIn a 2003 video installation, Corridor, Simpson sets two women side-by-side; a household servant from 1860 and a wealthy homeowner from 1960. Both women are portrayed by artist Wangechi Mutu, allowing parallel and haunting relationships to be drawn. Music, sometimes lulling and other times sharp and haunting, is used to create \"an interesting melding visually of two time periods.\" Simpson uses \"open-ended narratives\" in both photography and film because of her interest in \"insinuating things\". In Corridor, \"nothing really happens, it's just a woman going kind of day-to-day, what she does over the course of a day.\" A \"texture\" begins to appear, guiding viewers to ask, \"what's missing from the picture\" and \"what [\u2018s] trying to [be] conveyed.\" These questions create a setting or \"period of time\" to imagine a narrative, to figure out  \"these people's lives during a particular period of time that is important politically.\" The viewer can digest the political environment and find associations with their own political climate. In addition to considering identity, Corridor considers the past and its effect on the present. Simpson is examining race and class, and attempts \"to explore American identity and constructions of race.\" Simpson commented at the time, \"I do not appear in any of my work. I think maybe there are elements to it and moments to it that I use from my own personal experience, but that, in and of itself, is not so important as what the work is trying to say about either the way we interpret experience or the way we interpret things about identity.\" \nIn 2009 Simpson introduced self-portraiture into her body of work with the series 1957\u20132009. Simpson juxtaposed found, pinup-style images of young African American women from 1957 with present day photographs of herself reproducing the model\u2019s pose, clothing and backdrop. Simpson thus recreated a narrative of beauty ideals that excluded black women in the 1950s.\nSimpson\u2019s newer works have been series that incorporate found photographs and appropriated imagery from vintage magazines and the Associated Press. The black and white imagery is often layered with type, screen printed on gessoed plexiglass and washed with saturated inks. Natural elements, particularly ice, often appear in these works. Glass blocks representing ice appear in her sculptural work as well. Simpson\u2019s newer work continues to thread figuration, abstraction, metaphor and paradox to challenge race and gender stereotypes.\nArtists that have influenced Simpson's work include David Hammons, Adrian Piper, and Felix-Gonzalex Torres; and writers like Ishmael Reed, Langston Hughes, Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison because of their rhythmical voice.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nIn 1998, Simpson served on the jury that selected Douglas Gordon as winner of the Hugo Boss Prize.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom 2007 until 2018, Simpson was married to fellow artist James Casebere. They have a daughter, Zora Casebere, an artist and Instagram personality.\nSimpson shared a four-story studio with Casebere from 2009 until 2018; the building was David Adjaye's first completed project in the US. In 2014, she spent a three-week residency at collector Pamela Joyner's Sonoma, California, estate. In 2018, she moved into a new studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. \n\n\n== Recognition ==\n1985 \u2013 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, United States\n1987 \u2013 Workspace Grant, Jamaica Arts Center\n1989 \u2013 Artists Space board of directors, New York, NY\n1990 \u2013 Louis Comfort Tiffany Award, Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, New York, NY\n1994 \u2013 Artist Award for a Distinguished Body of Work, College Art Association, New York, NY\n1997 \u2013 Artist-in-Residence Grant, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, OH\n1998 \u2013 Finalist, Hugo Boss Prize 1998, Solomon R.

He lives and works in Vienna, Austria, and New York. Since 2021, Schinwald is professor at the Staatlichen Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste, Karlsruhe. Previously, he taught phenomenology at Yale University.\n\n\n== Work ==\nOccupied space and the body in its cultural context are central to Schinwald's works as foundational elements for transformation and manipulation.  He has worked in a variety of media: painting, sculpture, film, performance, and large, site-specific installations. His work \"is centered on the body as a cultural construct, as an incessantly actualized site at which the subject is constituted both in its identity and its instability and transversality. He is not true to one medium, but rather nomadic as he appropriates methods and/or devices from cultural theory, film, and poetry, among others. Dysfunctionality and disorder are key notions in his work.\"\nSchinwald's early training in fashion and costume history often becomes apparent in his work. One of his earliest pieces, Jubelhemd (1997), hovers between straight jacket and formal wear. The arms have been sewn in upside-down, provoking an ambivalent gesture reminiscent of both surrender and celebration, with hands to the sky.\nIn his work, Schinwald creates a precarious, at times unsettling, atmosphere. He equips the subjects of his 19th century portraits with peculiar veils, supports, wires and bandages, which the artist perceives as \"prostheses for unspecified cases.\" Schinwald first began his over-painted portraits in the late 1990s, and has been a reference point for later work by artists like Hans-Peter Feldman, who imposes clown-noses onto oil portraits in a similar manner. Together with a team of conservators, Schinwald developed a technique in 2011 for integrating historical paintings into large canvases, extending the original work which, in effect, alters not only the scale of the artwork, but blurs the lines of the inserted image's historical and contextual fixity. Since 2019, Schinwald further accentuates this body of work with additions that reference the digitized world, incorporating technoid blurs of pixels and vertical purple lines suggestive of numerical glitches on a computer. \nLike his manipulated paintings and black-and-white portraits, Schinwald's installations and spatial interventions, (for, among others, SFMoMA, Yvon Lambert Gallery, and Migros Museum) embrace constraints and compulsions. Representation and actuation often overlap in his work, whether it be the display of possible prosthetics with historical paintings, or manipulated table-leg sculptures with a choreographed performance.  In 2013, a terrarium model at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris served as both model and overture to a companion exhibition, an extensive, mid-career survey, at CAPC Bordeaux,\nSince 1999, Schinwald has also worked collaboratively with dancer Oleg Soulimenko on the Stage Matrix series, which has toured worldwide and been performed at, among others, Performa 07, Moderna Museet, and the Tanzquartier, Vienna. In 2015, Schinwald choreographed a piece for the Royal Swedish Ballet. From 2012 to 2018, Schinwald was the Vice President of the Vienna Secession.  Together with Thomas D. Trummer and Hans Ulrich Obrist, he is also curator of the EVN Collection in Austria.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSchinwald is represented by Thaddaeus Ropac (London, Salzburg, Paris) and Gio Marconi (Milan).\nSchinwald represented Austria in 2011 at the 54th Venice Biennial, where he created a vast, hanging labyrinth that disrupted the symmetry of Josef Hoffmann's 1934 construction. In the film for the exhibition, Orient (2011), the actors, appearing shipwrecked in decaying architecture, move with partially impulsive, partially dance-like choreography, both resisting and collaborating with their surroundings.\nHis works are to be found in numerous international collections, including the MoMA, Tate Modern Prada Foundation, SFMoMA, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne, Paris, Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and the MUMOK \u2013 Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\ndictio pii (2001)\ndiarios [barragan] (2003)\ndiarios [to you] (2003)\n1st Part Conditional (2004)\nChildren's Crusade (2004)\nOrient (2011)\n\n\n== Monographs ==\nModerna Museet, dictio pii, Stockholm: Moderna Museet, 2001.

He lived and worked in New York City for much of his career before moving his studio to Rock Tavern, New York. Stella's work catalyzed the minimalist movement in the late 1950s. He moved to New York City in the late 1950s, where he created works which emphasized the picture-as-object. These  were influenced by the abstract expressionist work of artists like Franz Kline and Jackson Pollock. He developed a reductionist approach to his art, saying he wanted to demonstrate that for him, every painting is \"a flat surface with paint on it\u2014nothing more\", and disavowed conceptions of art as a means of expressing emotion. He won notice in the New York art world in 1959 when his four black pinstripe paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art. Stella was a recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 2009 and the Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture by the International Sculpture Center in 2011.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFrank Stella was born in Malden, Massachusetts, on May 12, 1936, to first-generation Italian-American parents, as the oldest of their three children. His grandparents on both sides had immigrated to the United States at the turn of the 20th century from Sicily. His father, Frank Sr., was a gynecologist, and his mother Constance (n\u00e9e Santonelli) was a housewife and artist who attended fashion school and later took up landscape painting. His father painted houses to pay his way through medical school, with young Stella as his helper. Many years later he told an interviewer, \"My father would make me sand the floor; we had to do the sanding and scraping before you could hold the brush and then paint on the wall. So it was that kind of apprenticeship and familiarity.\"\nStella went to high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where Carl Andre, later to become a minimalist sculptor, was in the class behind him, but Andre said they never actually met. In his sophomore year, the abstractionist Patrick Morgan, a teacher at the school, began teaching Stella how to paint. At this time Stella was particularly affected by the work of the artist Josef Albers, a Bauhaus color theorist, and Hans Hofmann, an influential proto-Abstract Expressionist. After entering Princeton University where he majored in history, played lacrosse and wrestled, Stella took art courses and was introduced to the New York art scene by painter Stephen Greene and art historian William C. Seitz, professors at the school who brought him to exhibitions in the city. His work was influenced by abstract expressionism.\nIn the 1970s, he moved into NoHo in Manhattan in New York City. As of 2015, Stella lived in Greenwich Village and kept an office there but commuted on weekdays to his upstate studio at Rock Tavern, New York, in the Hudson River Valley. The critic and essayist Megan O'Grady visited the studio in 2019, and writing for the New York Times Style Magazine, described it as a \"hangar-like structure\", its entrance marked by a piece of wood spray-painted with the name \"Stella\". She called the interior a \"vast space more easily traversed by golf cart than on foot\", divided into separate rooms for fabrication and display, with a curtain hanging in the rear behind which he kept his spray-painter, his industrial sander, and new works being assembled. \n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Late 1950s and early 1960s ===\n\nAfter moving to New York City in the late 1950s, Stella began to create works which emphasized the picture-as-object. His visits to the art galleries of New York, where he was exposed to the abstract expressionist work of artists like Franz Kline and Jackson Pollock, had exerted a great influence on his development as an artist.\nHe created a series of paintings in 1958\u20131959 known as his \"Black Paintings\" which flouted conventional ideas of painterly composition. At age 22 in late 1958, he used commercial enamel paint and a house-painter's brush to paint black stripes of the same width and evenly spaced on bare canvas, leaving the thin strips of canvas between them unpainted and exposed, along with his pencil-and-ruler drawn guidelines. These paintings, his response to the Abstract Expressionist movement that grew in the years following World War II, were devoid of color and meant to lack any visual stimulation.\nDie Fahne Hoch! (1959), one of the \"Black Paintings\" series, takes its name (\"Hoist the Flag!\" or \"Raise the Flag!\" in English) from the first line of the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", the anthem of the Nazi Party. According to Stella himself, the painting has similar proportions as flags used by that organization.\nStella's work was a catalyst for the minimalist movement in the late 1950s; he stressed the properties of the materials he used in his paintings, disavowing any conception of art as a means of expressing emotion. He made a splash in the New York art world in 1959 when his four black pinstripe paintings were shown in the Sixteen Americans exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, along with works by Louise Nevelson, Ellsworth Kelly, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. Taking a reductionist approach to his art, Stella said he sought to demonstrate that he considered every painting as \"a flat surface with paint on it\u2014nothing more\". The same year, several of his paintings were included in the Three Young Americans showing at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College. A year later, his first gallery show at art dealer Leo Castelli's New York gallery gained him few sales. Stella shared studio space with Hollis Frampton and Carl Andre, both of whom had attended Phillips Academy, and scrounged a living by renting cold-water flats and painting houses.\nStella repudiated all efforts by critics to interpret his work. In a 1964 radio broadcast of a discussion of contemporary art with fellow artists Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, he summarized his concerns as a painter with the words, \"My painting is based on the fact that only what can be seen there is there. It really is an object... All I want anyone to get out of my paintings, and all I ever get out of them, is the fact that you can see the whole idea without any confusion.... What you see is what you see.\" The much-quoted tautology, \"What you see is what you see\", became \"the unofficial motto of the minimalist movement\", according to the New York Times.\nFrom 1960, his works used shaped canvases, developing in 1966 into more elaborate designs, as in the Irregular Polygon series (67). In 1961, Stella followed Barbara Rose, later a well-known art critic, to Pamplona, Spain, where she had gone on a Fulbright fellowship; they married in London that November. Upon their return to New York, Rose and Stella moved into an apartment near Union Square and had two children. After they split up in 1969, Rose began to reconsider her relationship with minimalism, and became a champion of less well-recognized painters.\n\n\n=== Late 1960s and early 1970s ===\n\nIn 1967, Stella designed the set and costumes for Scramble, a dance piece by Merce Cunningham. The same year, his began his Protractor Series (1967\u201371) of paintings, named after the common measuring instrument, a half circle protractor. These feature arcs, sometimes overlapping, within square borders named after circular-plan cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. He was especially intrigued by the arches and decorative patterns he observed in the architecture and art of Iran. His painting, Protractor Variation I (1969), now at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, epitomizes his move away from ascetic, monochrome compositions to the vibrant colors and formal complexity of his output after the late 1960s. This work typified his experimentation with shaped canvases, producing innovative paintings in which the imagery was set by their contours.\nIn 1969, Stella was commissioned to create a logo for the Metropolitan Museum of Art Centennial. The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a retrospective of Stella's work in 1970, making him the youngest artist to receive one. Stella was among those artists invited to participate in the problem-plagued 35th Art Biennale in Venice (1970) who joined a boycott by artists opposed to the US wars in Vietnam and Cambodia and withdrew their works from display at the American Pavilion.\nIn the following decade, as he began to adopt more unusual color schemes and shapes, Stella brought to his artistic productions the element of relief, which he called \"maximalist\" painting because it had sculptural attributes. He presented wood and other materials in his Polish Village series (1970\u20131973), executed in high relief. They were inspired by photographs and drawings he saw of wooden synagogues that the Nazis had burned down in eastern Poland during World War II.\nStella abandoned rational structures in the mid-1970s and began to explore new, individualistic paths. He replaced solid planes with sqiggles, lattices, and swirls of color. Composite features began to project from his canvases in all directions, while his wall-mounted paintings evolved into outlandish sculptures. Through the 1970s and 1980s, as his works became more uninhibited and intricate, his minimalism became baroque.\nIn 1976, Stella was commissioned by BMW to paint a BMW 3.0 CSL for the second installment in the BMW Art Car Series. He said of this project, \"The starting point for the art cars was racing livery. The graph paper is what it is, a graph, but when it's morphed over the car's forms it becomes interesting. Theoretically it's like painting on a shaped canvas.\"\nHe married pediatrician Harriet McGurk in 1978.\n\n\n=== 1980s and afterward ===\n\nFrom the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Stella produced a large oeuvre that grappled with Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick in a broad way. In this period of his career, as the relief of his paintings became increasingly higher with more undercutting, the process eventually resulted in fully three-dimensional sculptural forms that he derived from decorative architectural elements, and incorporating French curves, pillars, waves, and cones. To generate these works, he made collages or scale models that were subsequently enlarged to the original's specifications by his assistants, along with the use of digital technology and industrial metal cutters.\nIn 1993, he designed and executed for Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre a 10,000-square-foot mural installation which covers the ceiling of the dome, the proscenium arch and the exterior rear wall of the building. The mural for the dome was based on computer-generated imagery. In 1997, he oversaw the installation of the 5,000-square-foot Euphonia at the Moores Opera House at the Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music at the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas. A monumental sculpture of his, titled Prinz Friedrich von Homburg, Ein Schauspiel, 3X, was installed outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nFrom 1978 to 2005, Stella owned the Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart building in Manhattan's East Village and used it as his studio which resulted in the facade being restored. After a six-year campaign by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the historic building was designated a New York City Landmark in 2012. After 2005, Stella split his time between his West Village apartment and his Newburgh, New York, studio.\nThe Scarlatti K series, begun in 2006, consists of eight works by Stella from his Scarlatti Kirkpatrick polychrome sculpture series, for which he used a 3-D printer to create the metal and resin segments. The series title refers to the music of the Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, known for his short but exuberant Baroque period harpsichord sonatas (he wrote more than 500 of them), and to Ralph Kirkpatrick, the American musicologist and harpsichordist, who brought Scarlatti's work to the attention of the listening public, and in 1953 produced the authoritative scholarly catalogue of the sonatas. Stella was inspired by the sonatas, and his series works, like the sonatas, are given \"K\" numbers, but they allude to Scarlatti's music abstractly with visual rhythm and movement, according to Stella, rather than literal correlation. Stella continued producing new works in the series into 2012. These were shown at the Freedman Art Gallery that year, and commenting about his work in the series, Stella said, \"If you follow the edges of the lines, there's a sense of movement, and when they move well and the color follows, they become colorful, and that's what happens in the Scarlatti\u2014it builds up and it moves...\". Ron Labaco, a curator at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, showed Stella's work in an exhibition featuring computer-enabled pieces, Out of Hand: Materialising the Postdigital (2013-14).\nBy the turn of the 2010s, Stella started using the computer as a painterly tool to produce stand-alone star-shaped sculptures. The resulting stars are often monochrome, black or beige or naturally metallic, and their points can take the form of solid planes, spindly lines or wire-mesh circuits. His Jasper's Split Star (2017), a sculpture constructed out of six small geometric grids that rest on an aluminum base, was installed at 7 World Trade Center in 2021. It was created to replace the large (each ten feet wide by ten feet tall) diptych of his paintings, Laestrygonia I and Telepilus Laestrygonia II, that had been displayed in the lobby of the original World Trade Center, destroyed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.\nIn late 2022, Stella launched his first NFT (non-fungible token) for his Geometries project in  collaboration with the Artists Rights Society (ARS). It includes the right to the CAD files to 3D print the art works in the NFTs. Katarina Feder, director of business development at ARS, said, \"We sold out all 2,100 tokens, and, importantly, brought in resale royalties for secondary sales, something that Frank has been championing for decades.\"\n\n\n== Artists' rights ==\nOn June 1, 2008, Stella, a member artist of the Artists Rights Society) published with ARS president Theodore Feder an op-ed for The Art Newspaper decrying a proposed U.S. Orphan Works law which \"remove[s] the penalty for copyright infringement if the creator of a work, after a diligent search, cannot be located\".\nIn the op-ed, Stella wrote,\n\nThe Copyright Office presumes that the infringers it would let off the hook would be those who had made a \"good faith, reasonably diligent\" search for the copyright holder. Unfortunately, it is totally up to the infringer to decide if he has made a good faith search.\nThe Copyright Office proposal would have a disproportionately negative, even catastrophic, impact on the ability of painters and illustrators to make a living from selling copies of their work.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nStella's work was included in several exhibitions in the 1960s, among them the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's The Shaped Canvas (1965) and Systemic Painting (1966). The Museum of Modern Art in New York presented a second retrospective of Stella's work in 1970.\nThe exhibition \"Frank Stella and Synagogues of Historic Poland\", was on view at the POLIN Museum in Warsaw through June 20, 2016. The series of paintings on display, Polish Village (1970\u201374), had previously been exhibited at other venues, including the Fort Worth Museum of Dallas in 1978, the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1987, and the Jewish Museum in New York in 1983. The paintings were inspired by photographs and drawings he saw of wooden synagogues that the Nazis had burned down in eastern Poland during World War II. They came from Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka's book Wooden Synagogues (Arkady, 1959), and were themselves part of the exhibition.\nIn 2012, a retrospective of Stella's career was shown at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nIn 2014, Stella gave his sculpture Adjoeman (2004) as a long-term loan to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His works are in the collections of many major art institutions, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Art Institute of Chicago; the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami; the List Visual Arts Center at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge; the Tate; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice; and the Kunstmuseum Basel.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nStella gave the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures in 1984, calling for a rejuvenation of abstraction by achieving the depth of baroque painting. These six talks were published by Harvard University Press in 1986 under the title Working Space.\nIn 2009, Frank Stella was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. In 2011, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture by the International Sculpture Center. In 1996, he received an honorary Doctorate from the University of Jena in Jena, Germany, where his large sculptures of the Hudson River Valley series are on permanent display, becoming the second artist to receive this honorary degree after Auguste Rodin in 1906.\nHe was heralded by the Birmingham Museum of Art for having created abstract paintings that bear \"no pictorial illusions or psychological or metaphysical references in twentieth-century painting\".\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriter and curator Klaus Ottmann says many art critics were outraged when Stella's Black Paintings (1958\u201360) were shown at the Museum of Modern Art's \"16 Americans\" (1959-1960) exhibition. Irving Sandler attributed the death of American gesture painting to the mortal blow dealt by these reductive and non-allusive paintings. According to Ottman, \"Today, they are universally considered seminal works of 20th-century American art.\"\nAccording to critic Megan O'Grady, art critics were shocked by the \"Black Paintings\", with their purposely flat affect, their extreme reductiveness, and their \"refusal to appease\". In her view, the young artist had been inspired by the artists he admired in New York, among them Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning, and felt that he was allowed freedom to do whatever he wanted with painting. She writes that critics have always been disconcerted by the fact that \"the godfather of Minimalist painting\" became a forbear of modern baroque.\nThe art historian and critic Douglas Crimp writes that the notion of art as existing detached from everything else and autonomous proceeds from the logic of modernism, and is a notion maintained by contemporary painting into the 1980s. Painting is understood as having an origin and an essential nature, and its historical development as being a long, unbroken panorama. According to Crimp, the stylistic change that occurred during the late 1970s in Frank Stella's work embodied this art historical view of painting and how it operates to maintain the practice of painting. By his lights, Stella's shift to the \"flamboyantly idiosyncratic constructed works\" of this period was \"a kind of quantum leap\" compared to his breakout works of the late 1950s.\nFor Crimp it was Stella's earliest paintings which suggested to his fellows that the end of painting had at last arrived. He sees Stella as working in profound torment over the inferences made by those early works, moving ever further away from them, and disavowing them more vehemently with every new series. Crimp goes on to say the late 1970s paintings \"are truly hysterical in their defiance of the black paintings; each one reads as a tantrum, shrieking and sputtering that the end of painting has not come\".\nWhen the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited its Frank Stella retrospective in 2015, art critic Jerry Saltz reminded viewers that Stella had declared \"I don't make Conceptual Art. I need the physical thing to work with or against.\" Saltz advised them to think literally, and in terms of the space the works occupy and the nature of their surfaces, seeing color as an element of their structures. He described Stella as being one of \"the first to deal as directly as possible with the perception of material, form, and color\", \"the first hard-core Minimalist painter\", and \"a forerunner to the Postminimalism that defined the late 1960s and 1970s\". Saltz goes on to say \"even though he's prone to cranking out a lot of work that looks like God-awful space junk, I always pay attention to this artist\".\n\n\n== Art market ==\nIn May 2019, Christie's set an auction record for one of Stella's works with the sale of his Point of Pines, which sold for $28 million.\nIn April 2021, his Scramble: Ascending Spectrum/Ascending Green Values (1977) was sold for \u00a32.4 million ($3.2 million with premium) in London. The painting was bought for $1.9 million in 2006 from the collection of Belgian art patrons Roger and Josette Vanthournout at Sotheby's.\n\n\n== Stella and the sport of squash ==\nIn the 1980s, Stella took up the game of squash after he injured his back while opening a garage door. His racquet was strung with five bright colors. He later had a squash court built at his horse farm in upstate New York, and formed close friendships with many squash players. In 1986 he told Nicholas Dawidoff, a writer for Sports Illustrated: \"The advantage of squash is that I can forget about painting. A white blank and a ball; you don\u2019t know where you are. It's like a snowstorm.\" Being interviewed in 1987 by Susan Orleans of The New Yorker, he quipped, \"In art, you can keep getting better, but in squash you hit your level and that's just about it. Curtains. You\u2019re finished. I hit my limit at about forty minutes of mediocre playing.\" \nSpeaking of Stella after his death, Ned Edwards, the executive director of the U.S. Squash Foundation, said that \"Frank was a transformational figure for squash.\" The director of the Tournament of Champions, John Nimick, said, \"Frank was a patron saint of our sport and various efforts to promote squash in New York City for forty years. He was a player, promoter, sponsor and creator of our perpetual trophy.\"\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nFrom 1961 to 1969, Stella was married to art historian Barbara Rose; they had two children, Rachel and Michael. At the time of his death, he was married to Harriet E. McGurk, a pediatrician. They had two sons, Patrick and Peter. He also had a daughter, Laura, from a relationship with Shirley De Lemos Wyse between his marriages.\nStella died of lymphoma at his home in West Village, Manhattan, on May 4, 2024, eight days before his 88th birthday.\n\n\n== Gallery of works ==\n\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\nJulia M.

Moll works in the media fine art printmaking, drawing and painting and its expansion in the areas of performance art and conceptual art. Beside works on canvas and paper; Happening, video art and installation count to her \u0152uvre. A large part of her work stands in the traditions of appropriation art, pop art, fluxus and action painting. She lives and works in New York and Berlin.\n\n\n== Life and work ==\nAs a student Eva Moll took weekend courses at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt am Main in 1989. After her German preparatory school graduation in 1994 at the Rudolf Koch School in Offenbach am Main, she completed a one-year internship at the fine art painter and restorer Manfred Scharpf at the Castle Zeil in Leutkirch im Allg\u00e4u. There she acquired knowledge to old master techniques and processes in the studio and exhibition making.\nFrom 1995 Eva Moll studied at the Kunsthochschule Kassel in Germany in the fields of visual communication and fine arts. Her study focus was on free graphics, drawing and painting with old and new media and interdisciplinary art. While studying Moll realized the global multi-media project: \"The Ornamental Symbol\" on traveling in Europe, Asia, Africa and America (1996\u20131998). This was followed by the urban visual diary project \"Eva in The Big Apple\" in New York City (1998\u20132000). 2000 Eva Moll graduated with an artistic university degree (M.f.A.) under the Professors Walter Rabe and Paul Driessen.\nIn 2000 Moll migrated to New York. From 2000 to 2002 she worked as an assistant in the studio of American pop-artist Peter Max. In 2001 Moll had her first show at the La Mama Gallery in the Lower East Side. In 2002 she launched her first studio in New York after touring Los Angeles, San Francisco, Big Sur, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. In 2003 she founded the collective art group Galaxy Girls NYC. Since then the visual artist with curatorial practice organized exhibitions and happenings in interdisciplinary space. Moll is active in the public space of major cities as well as in the specialized areas of trade fairs, museums, galleries, art associations and in various groups of the international art market and art scene.\nIn 2006 Moll traveled with her project Europe ArtTourIsm to Athens, Barcelona, Budapest, Copenhagen and Luxembourg. In 2007 she performed unofficially with her artistic figure EVE at the openings of the art fairs Documenta 12, at the Armory Show in New York and at the Art Forum Berlin.

Jones (born 1968 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is an African-American artist living and working in Brooklyn, New York. Her work has been described, by Ken Johnson, as evoking minimalism, and paying tribute to the cross-pollination of different genres of music, especially jazz. As an artist, she connects most of her work between art and sound. Such connections are made with multiple mediums, from paintings to sculptures and paper to audio collages. In 2012, Jones was the recipient of the Joyce Alexander Wien Prize, one of the biggest awards given to an individual artist in the United States. The prize honors one African-American artist who has proven their commitment to innovation and creativity, with an award of 50,000 dollars.\nIn December 2015 a 10-year survey of Jones's work, titled Compilation, opened at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston, Texas.\n\n\n== Education ==\nJennie C. Jones received her BFA at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in 1991. She then graduated from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, earning her MFA in 1996. In the summer of 1996, Jones was a participant at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture.\n\n\n== Career ==\nJones is a visual and sonic artist whose paintings, sculptures, and works on paper incorporate ideas around minimalism, abstraction, Jazz, and Black history. Valerie Cassel Oliver noted in her \u201cOutside The Lines,\u201d catalogue essay, that \u201cworking in painting as well as sound, she has mined the politics, culture and aesthetic innovations of the mid-20th century and has emerged with sharp criticisms and astute queries that are now embedded in the work. Jones's work challenges us to understand the frameworks of modernism, which embraced black musical forms but excluded black visual art from its canon\". During Absorb / Diffuse, her fall 2011 exhibition at The Kitchen in New York City, Jones presented a piece titled From The Low, which is a sound piece that has multiple music samples, ranging from jazz to modern electronica. From The Low presents her political statement: that African-American artists and musicians are absent from modernism. The samples used in this sound piece have been \"given a new context, perhaps to be classified in a category of black minimalism\".\nThe audio pieces are constructed using traditional sound editing methodologies and often have their origin in historic recordings. With the amalgamation of industrial acoustic materials, often used in recording studios and listening rooms, Jones's art focuses on building a bridge between two-dimensional works, architecture, and sound. Jennie has stated that \"conceptualism allows these different media to occupy the same space.\u201d Jones is a critic in the Sculpture Department at Yale University.\n\n\n=== Works ===\n\n\n==== 2000s \u2013 early work ====\nIn Jones's 'Selected Early Works,' she combined photography, visual arts, and audio art. Jones's website displays 30 images of her work completed in the 2000s. These works not only includes static, lasting art but also records of her installation art, such as her 2003 A/V Sound Work installation. These works, along with the works that follow, are easily accessible on her artist website.  Towards the end of the early years of Jones work she received the William H. Johnson Prize in 2008.  This is a $25,000 award given to African American artists based in the Los Angeles area.\n\n\n==== 2009 \u2013 Atlanta ====\nThis installation was a collection of visual works of acrylic painting, ink and collage works among other mediums.

Gallery.\n\n\n==== 2015 \u2013 Group ====\nThis exhibition was a group collection at the Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery. Jones, along with Josephine Halvorson and Leslie Hewitt displayed works of paintings and photography during 12/11/15 - 1/28/16.\n\n\n==== 2016 \u2013 Compilation ====\nThis installation at The Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, Texas, was on display from December 11, 2015 - March 27, 2016 and combined 2D art and 3D art.\n\n\n==== 2017 \u2013 Amplitude ====\nThis installation included both paint on canvas and acoustic soundboard. The Sikkema, Jenkins & Co. Gallery had this to say about Jones's Amplitude: \"Jennie C. Jones' work exposes the connections between conceptual and avant-garde African-American music and the cultural, political, and historical ideas surrounding Minimalism and Abstraction. Jones brings to light the unlikely alliances that emerged between the visual arts and the imprint of music, highlighting the way they became and continue to exist as tangible markers of social evolution and political strivings.\"\n\n\n==== 2018 \u2013 Alternative Takes ====\nThis installation was at the Patron Gallery, Chicago, Illinois from February 3 - March 18, 2018.

By the early 1980s he had become a major figure in international contemporary art, the subject of several television documentaries and a caf\u00e9 society regular. He is known for his architectonic art, prolific output in various media, friendships with key cultural figures, and polemical lectures and interviews.\nHis practice in architectural and autonomous stained glass, often on a monumental scale, has led to successive innovation and invention in the development of the medium. This includes the creation of stained glass without lead and the subsequent pioneering of a 'dramatically enhanced Pointillism' in glass, as well as the creation of sculptural stained glass works, analogous to collage, made primarily or entirely of lead. The latter two advances are described as having taken stained glass as an art form to its zero-point in each direction: absolute transparency and complete opacity.\nA lifelong exponent of the integration of art and architecture, his architectural collaborations include work with Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster, Arata Isozaki, Oscar Niemeyer, I. M. Pei, C\u00e9sar Pelli, and Renzo Piano. He served a seven-year term as chairman of The Architecture Foundation and served on the Design Review Committee of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. His artistic collaborations have included work with David Bailey, Hugh Hudson, Malcolm McLaren, and with Linda McCartney and Paul McCartney.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBrian Clarke was born in Oldham, Lancashire, to Edward Ord Clarke, a coal miner, and Lilian Clarke (n\u00e9e Whitehead), a cotton spinner. Raised in a family familiar with Spiritualism \u2013 his maternal grandmother was a notable local medium \u2013 Clarke attended a Spiritualist Lyceum throughout his childhood and was considered a 'sensitive', gaining a reputation locally as a 'boy medium'.\nAged 12, he applied for a place in the last intake of an education scheme existing in the north of England to enable artistically promising children to leave their secondary school and become full-time art students,  and was awarded a scholarship to the Oldham School of Arts and Crafts. In place of a standard curriculum, he principally studied the arts and design, learning drawing, heraldry, pictorial composition, colour theory, pigment mixing and calligraphy, among other subjects. Considered a prodigy, by the age of 16 Clarke had mastered the orthodoxies of academic life drawing. In 1968, he and his family moved to Burnley and, too young at 15 to gain entrance to Burnley College of Art, he lied about his age and was accepted on the strength of his previous work.\nIn 1970, Clarke enrolled in the Architectural Stained Glass course at North Devon College of Art and Design, graduating from the Diploma in Design with a first class distinction. In 1974, he was awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Travelling Fellowship to study religious art in Italy, France, and West Germany. He was inspired by the post-war German school of stained glass artists, and in particular the artist Johannes Schreiter. In 1976, Clarke received the Churchill Extension Fellowship to study art in architecture and contemporary painting in the United States, where he connected with the art of, and later befriended, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn his career, Clarke has advanced new approaches across a range of mediums including stained glass, mosaic, collage, painting and drawing.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nClarke received his first architectural commission at the age of 17. However, his suite of 20 windows for the Church of St Lawrence, Longridge (1975) is considered his first mature work. Here, the use of transparent glass has a Pop Art sensibility; the 'see through\u2019 panes embrace the everyday by letting the real world in. In 1976, Clarke received a large-scale commission from the University of Nottingham to produce 45 paintings, vestments, and a series of stained glass windows for a multi-faith chapel in the Queen's Medical Centre. One of the largest public art commissions of the decade, the process of design and installation was filmed by the BBC as material for a documentary.\nIn the early years of his career, most of Clarke's work was for religious buildings. However, by 1978 his relationship with the Church had become untenable, as his designs were constantly being modified. The ending of this relationship freed Clarke to create stained glass for secular contexts and advance the medium as social art. Throughout this period, Clarke was active in bringing attention to stained glass and promoting it as a modern medium. In 1975, he organised the travelling exhibition Glass Art One, which featured secular, autonomous stained glass panels inspired in part by Japanese-landscape painting. Later, he co-curated GLASS/LIGHT, an extensive survey of twentieth-century stained glass, with British war artist John Piper and art historian Martin Harrison, in collaboration with the artist Marc Chagall as part of the 1978 Festival of the City of London. Clarke also produced the book Architectural Stained Glass,a polemical collection of essays.\nIn his painting, Clarke developed a strictly abstract Constructivist language of geometric signs; often his work had an underlying grid structure made from repetitions and variations on the cross. In later years, he would disrupt the grid with free-flowing amorphic forms. In 1977 Punk hit the UK, which had a deep impact on Clarke. He connected with Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren and later collaborated as a designer on their aborted zine Chicken, whose creation was funded by EMI and filmed by BBC's Arena. He also expressed Punk's nihilistic energy in the 1977 series of paintings, \u2018Dangerous Visions\u2019 (1977). Around the same time, Clarke became friends with the physical chemist Lord Snow. After Snow's death, he made a tributary portfolio of screenprints; their title, The Two Cultures referenced Snow's influential 1959 Rede Lecture on the perceived gulf between the humanities and sciences. In 1983 the Tate acquired an edition of The Two Cultures.\nBetween 1978 and 1979, the BBC filmed Clarke's studio practice and life for an hour-long BBC Omnibus documentary, Brian Clarke: The Story So Far. Millions watched the documentary in the UK, and the BBC recorded multiple viewer complaints. The programme and subsequent press coverage, including Clarke's appearance on the cover of Vogue, photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, brought him to broader public attention. Later in 1979, Clarke became a presenter on the BBC2 arts programme Mainstream and the BBC Radio 4 programme Kaleidescope, conducting interviews with figures including Brassa\u00ef, Andy Warhol, John Lennon, and Elisabeth Lutyens. He also gave Sheffield band The Human League their first television appearance.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nIn the 1980s Clarke was instrumental in bringing stained glass into the public sphere. He received his first international commission for paintings, a wooden construction, and a suite of stained glass windows for the Olympus European Headquarters Building in Hamburg, completed in 1981. Marking a major shift in his own practice and breaking with tradition, he had the windows made at a studio in Germany. The experience of their immersive colour prompted critics to describe them as the Colour Field of stained glass. Another development in this work is Clarke's liberation of the lead line from being a purely structural element: where the lead breaks free, it takes on an expressive quality. In the same year, receiving a commission from the Government of Saudi Arabia for the Royal Mosque of King Khalid International Airport, Clarke studied Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez. Following this, in 1984, the architectural practice Derek Latham and Co. asked Clarke to collaborate on the refurbishment of Henry Currey's Grade II listed Thermal Baths in Buxton. Satisfying his social ambitions for the medium, he enclosed the former Victorian spa in a barrel-vaulted skin of stained glass, bathing the public space \u201cin an immense blue light\u201d. It is one of Clarke's earliest works to have been designed to have a deliberate nocturnal presence.\n\nIn 1988, architect Arata Isozaki approached Clarke to collaborate on the Lake Sagami Building in Yamanishi. Clarke designed a composition of stained glass for the central lantern and a series of interrelated skylights that referenced elements of Isozaki's building. In the same period, Clarke collaborated with Norman Foster and his architectural practice Foster + Partners to design stained glass for Stansted Airport's new terminal building. For the first time in the history of stained glass, computer-assisted design was utilised in its visualisation and design. Partly for security reasons, the design couldn't be used. The final commission was for two friezes and a 6-metre high tower of stained glass. While their abstract, constructivist forms resonated with Foster's language, Clarke has recently expressed how the medieval technology of lead and stained glass was at odds with the material qualities of High-tech architecture. An urge to resolve this conflict later spurred Clarke to embrace the most cutting-edge glass technology.\nEqually experimental across other mediums, Clarke's painting practice was also inspired by technology. Noticing the similarity between the reticular, Constructivist-derived symbols that dominated his work and the light-metering computergrams from Olympus OM System cameras, he produced a series of technology-related paintings, including Time Lag Zero, for the headquarters of Olympus Optical (UK). During this period, Clarke produced the cover painting for Paul McCartney's solo album Tug of War, designing the cover with Linda McCartney. He also created the stage designs for Paul McCartney's World Tour (1989\u201390).\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nContinuing to work collaboratively with leading architects, Clarke started to challenge the traditional containment of stained glass within a frame and fashion entire facades from glass. When Future Systems (the architectural practice of Jan Kaplick\u00fd and Amanda Levete) asked Clarke to collaborate on The Glass Dune (1992), he proposed an internal \u2018skin of art\u2019 for their innovative boomerang-shaped building, which was never realised. Collaborating later with expressionist architect Will Alsop on the design of H\u00f4tel du D\u00e9partement des Bouches du Rh\u00f4ne (which became known as Le Grand Bleu), Clarke clad the building in an Yves Klein blue glass. A landmark in the city of Marseille, the building is now considered a major work of late 20th century architecture.\nDesiring lighter and more expansive fields of glass, Clarke continued searching for new technologies. Working with architect Zaha Hadid on a proposal for the Spittelau Viaducts Housing Project, Vienna, he developed a new type of mouth-blown glass, which he christened 'Zaha-Glas'. Although this project was never realised, the newly developed 'Zaha-Glas' was first used architecturally in Clarke's scheme for the ceiling of Pfizer World Headquarters in New York, a landmark architectural art project that connected 42nd and 43rd Streets in Manhattan. Working with Foster on the design for the Al Faisaliyah Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (installed 1999), Clarke abandoned the medieval technology of glass and supportive lead entirely and conceived a novel solution that involved firing a ceramic frit glaze into float glass. The new glass had a lightness that matched Norman Foster's High-tech building. Clarke, however, continued to use traditional, medieval technologies in other architectural contexts.  \nClarke continued to be active in other mediums in addition to stained glass. In 1993, he created the set designs for Paul McCartney's New World Tour (1993); one of the sets was a collage of stained glass through the ages. The following year, Clarke had a joint show with Linda McCartney. The exhibition, Collaborations, showed works by both artists and collaborative pieces in which McCartney's photos were silkscreened onto mouth-blown glass using a process of their own devising.\nIn 1998 the English High Court severed all ties between Francis Bacon's former gallery, Marlborough Fine Art, and the Estate of Francis Bacon. Clarke was appointed sole executor of the Estate of Francis Bacon, acting on behalf of Bacon's heir John Edwards. Clarke transferred representation of Francis Bacon to the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, where an exhibition was mounted of seventeen previously unseen Bacon paintings recovered from his studio. Clarke brought a second court case against Marlborough Fine Art, alleging that the gallery had underpaid Bacon for his work, asserted undue influence over him, and failed to account for up to 33 of his paintings. Following Edwards' diagnosis with lung cancer in 2002, the litigation was settled out of court, with each side paying its own costs. During the legal process an undisclosed number of Bacon's paintings were recovered from Marlborough, and \"vast quantities of correspondence and documents relating to the life of the artist were handed over by the gallery\".\n\nIn 1998, Edwards and Clarke donated the contents of Bacon's studio at 7 Reece Mews, London, left untouched since Bacon's death, to the Hugh Lane, the Dublin City Gallery. What followed was a unique conservation project. A decision was taken to preserve the studio as it stood, and a team of archaeologists, art historians, conservators, and curators were involved in the move from London to Dublin. The locations of over 7,000 items were documented, and in Dublin, the studio was rebuilt using all the original doors, flooring, walls, and ceiling, and the items were placed exactly as they were left. The studio opened to the public in 2001, accompanied by the first-ever database to list the contents of an artist's studio.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nContinuing to advance his architectural vision for stained glass, in 2015 Clarke orchestrated the site-specific exhibition Lamina at the Gagosian Gallery, London, where floor to ceiling stained glass depicting golden leaves transformed the gallery space and immersed the visitors illuminated natural forms. Nature became a central theme for Clarke's work in these years. In an interview, Clarke acknowledged feeling close to Henri Matisse, who had worked in stained glass and whose work often glorified the wonders of nature. Nature also inspired Clarke's stained glass and ceramic works at Mall Cottages in West London. Clarke worked with Norman Foster on the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a landmark building in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, built to house the triennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. Clarke's 9,700 square expanse of stained glass crowns the apex of the pyramid (installed 2006), featuring imagery of soaring doves. \nIn another example of Clarke breaking the medieval relationship between glass and lead, in the 2000s he took the radical step to inverse their relationship and began fashioning works entirely of lead. In these autonomous lead works, Clarke often uses the somber weightiness of lead to explore darker themes like mortality. His leadwork Don't Forget the Lamb (2014) is a memorial to his late mother.\nIn this period, nature inspired Clarke's work in other mediums as well. His drawings of flowers use negative space as an expressive element, isolating the flowers in empty space with his signature, nervy line. This is seen in his later series, 'Night Orchids', exhibited at PACE Gallery in 2016. Clarke's collages are equally experimental; the carefully chosen, often torn, fragments and chalk drawings build an image that attempts to capture the essence of the flower depicted. In a radical gesture, Clarke brought the language of collage to stained glass in a wrap-around window at Peel Cottage (installed 2009), where he incorporated fragments of medieval glass within a contemporary design.\n\n\n=== 2010s to present ===\nIn 2010, Clarke was commissioned to design stained windows for the new Papal Chapel of the Apostolic Nunciature, the diplomatic embassy of the Holy See to Great Britain, for the 2010 visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom, the first-ever state visit made by a pope to Britain. The exhibition The Art of Light (2018) in Norwich highlighted Clarke's free-standing glass panels. While their folding structures draw inspiration from Japanese folding screens, they explore a new context for stained glass, no longer confined to the fabric of a building, but nevertheless having a strong architectural impact on whatever space they inhabit. The subject matter of these panels is diverse: many depict flowers and nature's opulence in vivid colour, but there are also images of intense grief and Pop-inspired subject matter. A Pop sensibility also runs through his Caryatids panels (2002), which depict muscular young men in beachwear by the sea. The work received criticism when it was shown at Christie's, London in 2011, reflective of the traditionalist values that surround the medium of stained glass.\nIn 2015, Clarke curated A Strong Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser, an exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, in association with Pace Gallery, together with author Harriet Vyner (whose 'cult biography' of Fraser, Groovy Bob, Clarke had contributed to). The 2014 solo exhibition Spitfires and Primroses with the Pace Gallery, juxtaposed two recent series of works, pairing oil paintings of the Second World War aircraft, arranged in a heraldic sem\u00e9, with watercolours of English primroses. The show revealed an underlying disquiet to Clarke's botanical imagery. This aspect resonated later in his paintings of poppies, which formed the exhibition Vespers at Phillips, London in 2021.\nIn 2020, it was announced that a new Blue Coat School was to be built in Oldham, Clarke's hometown, named the Brian Clarke Church of England Academy, to provide free school places to 1,200 pupils. The academy was granted planning permission in April 2021, with construction completed in 2023, and its first intake of pupils in September 2023\n\n\n== Selected projects ==\n\n\n=== Selected realised projects ===\n\n\n=== Selected unrealised projects ===\n\n\n== Recognition and roles ==\n1983 - 2020: Council Member, Winston Churchill Memorial Trust\n1989\u2013present: Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts\n1992: Visiting professor, Centre del Vidre, Barcelona\n1993\u2013present: Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects\n1994: Visiting professor of Architectural Art, Bartlett Institute of Architecture, UCL\n1995 - 2008: Trustee, The Stained Glass Museum, Ely\n1998\u2013present: Chairman and sole executor of The Estate of Francis Bacon\n2000 - 2005: Board member, Design Review Committee for the Commission of Architecture and the Built Environment\n2001\u2013present: Governor of Capital City Academy\n2001\u2013present: Trustee, The Lowe Educational Charitable Foundation\n2002 - 2013: Trustee, The Architecture Foundation\n2007 - 2013: Chairman of The Architecture Foundation\n2007 - 2020: Trustee, Winston Churchill Memorial Trust\n2016\u2013present: Chairman and trustee of the Zaha Hadid Foundation\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n1974: Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Fellowship\n1975: Churchill Fellowship Extension\n1988: Europa Nostra Award: Gold Medal (Cavendish Arcade, Buxton)\n1991: Leeds Award for Architecture (Victoria Quarter); Civic Trust Award (Victoria Quarter)\n1996: Award for Fine Architecture, Heidelberg\n2007: Honorary D.Litt., Huddersfield University\n2012: Honorary Liveryman, Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Master Glass Painters\n2018: Doctor of Humane Letters, Virginia Theological Seminary\n2021:  Honorary Fellow, Arts University Bournemouth\nClarke was knighted in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to art.\n\n\n== Selected exhibitions ==\n\n\n== Television and film ==\nBBC Omnibus \u2013 Brian Clarke: The Story So Far.

His best-known works are typically large-scale, freely-scribbled, calligraphic  and graffiti-like works on solid fields of mostly gray, tan, or off-white colors. His later paintings and works on paper shifted toward \"romantic symbolism\", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted poets such as St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Rainer Maria Rilke and John Keats, as well as classical myths and allegories, in his works. Examples of this are his Apollo and The Artist and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word \"VIRGIL\".\nTwombly's works are in the permanent collections of modern art museums globally, including the Menil Collection in Houston, the Tate Modern in London, New York's Museum of Modern Art and Munich's Museum Brandhorst. He was commissioned for a ceiling at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris.\nIn a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as \"influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well.\"\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nTwombly was born in Lexington, Virginia, on April 25, 1928. Twombly's father, also nicknamed \"Cy\", pitched for the Chicago White Sox. They were both nicknamed after the baseball great Cy Young, who pitched for, among others, the Cardinals, Red Sox, Indians, and Braves.\nAt age 12, Twombly began to take private art lessons with the Catalan modern master Pierre Daura.  After graduating from Lexington High School in 1946, Twombly attended Darlington School in Rome, Georgia, and studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1948\u201349), and at Washington and Lee University (1949\u201350) in Lexington, Virginia. On a tuition scholarship from 1950 to 1951, he studied at the Art Students League of New York, where he met Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he was briefly romantically involved. Rauschenberg encouraged him to attend Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina. At Black Mountain in 1951 and 1952 he studied with Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell and Ben Shahn, and met John Cage. The poet and rector of the College, Charles Olson, had a great influence on him.\nMotherwell arranged Twombly's first solo exhibition, which was organized by the Samuel M. Kootz Gallery in New York in 1951. At this time his work was influenced by Kline's black-and-white gestural expressionism, as well as Paul Klee's imagery. In 1952, Twombly received a grant from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts which enabled him to travel to North Africa, Spain, Italy, and France. He spent this journey in Africa and Europe with Robert Rauschenberg. In 1954, he served in the U.S. Army as a cryptographer in Washington, D.C., and would frequently travel to New York during periods of leave. From 1955 through 1956, he taught at the Southern Seminary and Junior College in Buena Vista, Virginia, currently known as Southern Virginia University; during the summer vacations, Twombly would travel to New York to paint in his Williams Street apartment.\nIn 1957, Twombly moved to Rome and made it his primary city, where he met the Italian artist Tatiana Franchetti \u2013 sister of his patron Baron Giorgio Franchetti. They were married at New York City Hall in 1959 and then bought a palazzo on the Via di Monserrato in Rome. In addition, they had a 17th-century palace in Bassano in Teverina, near Viterbo. In 2023, the palace was  restored and reopened to the public as an artists residence and an exhibition center. The first artist being hosted is American painter Robert Nava.\nAround 1961, through their mutual relationship with the artist Afro, Twombly met the American artist Joseph Glasco in Mykonos.  According to Glasco, he and Twombly \"saw each other every summer in Mykonos for years ... and saw a lot of each other daily\".\nIn 1964, Twombly met Nicola Del Roscio of Gaeta, who became his longtime companion. Twombly bought a house and rented a studio in Gaeta in the early 1990s. Twombly and Tatiana, who died in 2010, never divorced and remained friends.\nIn July 2011, after suffering from cancer for several years, Twombly died in Rome after a brief hospitalization. A plaque in Santa Maria in Vallicella commemorates him.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Painting ===\n\nAfter his return in 1953, Twombly served in the United States Army as a cryptologist, an activity that left a distinct mark on his artistic style. From 1955 to 1959, he worked in New York, where he became a prominent figure among a group of artists including Robert Rauschenberg, with whom he was sharing a studio, and Jasper Johns. Exposure to the emerging New York School purged figurative aspects from his work, encouraging a simplified form of abstraction. He became fascinated with tribal art, using the painterly language of the early 1950s to invoke primitivism, reversing the normal evolution of the New York School. Twombly soon developed a technique of gestural drawing characterized by thin white lines on a dark canvas that appear to be scratched onto the surface. He would apply bitumen on the canvas in a quick and coarse fashion, making the painting tactile and scarred with his energetic, gestural lines that would become his signature style. He stopped making sculptures in 1959 and did not take up sculpting again until 1976.\nTwombly often inscribed on paintings the names of mythological figures during the 1960s. Twombly's move to Gaeta in Southern Italy in 1957 gave him closer contact with classical sources. From 1962 he produced a cycle of works based on myths including Leda and the Swan and  The Birth of Venus; myths were frequent themes of Twombly's 1960s work. Between 1960 and 1963 Twombly painted the rape of Leda by the god Zeus/Jupiter in the form of a Swan six times, once in 1960, twice in 1962 and three times in 1963.\n\nTwombly's 1964 exhibition of the nine-panel Discourses on Commodus (1963) at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York was panned by artist and writer Donald Judd  who said \"There are a few drips and splatters and an occasional pencil line,\" he wrote in a review. \"There isn't anything to these paintings.\" They are currently exhibited at the Guggenheim Bilbao.\nErotic and corporeal symbols became more prominent, whilst a greater lyricism developed in his 'Blackboard paintings'. Between 1967 and 1971, he produced a number of works on gray grounds, the 'grey paintings'. This series features terse, colorless scrawls, reminiscent of chalk on a blackboard, that form no actual words and are examples of asemic writing. Twombly made this work using an unusual technique: he sat on the shoulders of a friend, who shuttled back and forth along the length of the canvas, thus allowing the artist to create his fluid, continuous lines.\n\nHis later sculptures exhibit a similar blend of emotional expansiveness and intellectual sophistication. From 1976, Twombly again produced sculptures, lightly painted in white, suggestive of Classical forms. In an interview with critic David Sylvester, on the occasion of the large exhibition of his sculpture at Kunstmuseum Basel in 2000, Twombly revealed that, for him, the demands of making sculpture were distinctly different from those required of painting. \"[Sculpture is] a whole other state. And it's a building thing. Whereas the painting is more fusing\u2014fusing of ideas, fusing of feelings, fusing projected on atmosphere.\"\nIn the mid-1970s, in paintings such as Untitled (1976), Twombly began to evoke landscape through colour (favouring brown, green and light blue), written inscriptions and collage elements. In 1978 he worked on the monumental historical ensemble Fifty Days at Iliam, a ten-part cycle inspired by Homer's Iliad; since then Twombly continued to draw on literature and myth, deploying cryptic pictorial metaphors that situate individual experience within the grand narratives of Western tradition, as in the Gaeta canvases and the monumental Four Seasons concluded in 1994.\n\nIn an essay in the catalogue to the 2011 Dulwich exhibition (see below), Katharina Schmidt summarizes the scope and technique of Twombly's \u0153uvre:\n\nCy Twombly's work can be understood as one vast engagement with cultural memory. His paintings, drawings and sculptures on mythological subjects have come to form a significant part of that memory. Usually drawing on the most familiar gods and heroes, he restricts himself to just a few, relatively well-known episodes, as narrated by poet-historians, given visible shape by artists and repeatedly reinterpreted in the literature and visual art of later centuries ... His special medium is writing. Starting out from purely graphic marks, he developed a kind of meta-script in which abbreviated signs, hatchings, loops, numbers and the simplest of pictographs spread throughout the picture plane in a process of incessant movement, repeatedly subverted by erasures. Eventually, this metamorphosed into script itself.\nHowever, in a 1994 article Kirk Varnedoe thought it necessary to defend Twombly's seemingly random marks and splashes of paint against the criticism that \"This is just scribbles \u2013 my kid could do it\".\n\nOne could say that any child could make a drawing like Twombly only in the sense that any fool with a hammer could fragment sculptures as Rodin did, or any house painter could spatter paint as well as Pollock. In none of these cases would it be true. In each case the art lies not so much in the finesse of the individual mark, but in the orchestration of a previously uncodified set of personal \"rules\" about where to act and where not, how far to go and when to stop, in such a way as the cumulative courtship of seeming chaos defines an original, hybrid kind of order, which in turn illuminates a complex sense of human experience not voiced or left marginal in previous art.\nTogether with Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, Twombly is regarded as the most important representative of a generation of artists who distanced themselves from abstract expressionism.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\nAfter having an art piece being shown at Stable Gallery from 1953 to 1957, Twombly moved to Leo Castelli Gallery and later exhibited with Gagosian Gallery. Gagosian Gallery opened a new gallery in Rome, Twombly's hometown, on December 15, 2007, with the inaugural exhibition, of Twombly's work, Three Notes from Salalah.\nIn 1993, at Matthew Marks Gallery in New York, an exhibition of Twombly's photographs offered a selection of large blurry color images of tulips, trees and ancient busts, based on the artist's Polaroids. In 2008, a specially curated selection of Twombly's photographic work was exhibited in Huis Marseille, the Museum for Photography, Amsterdam; the exhibition was opened by Sally Mann. For the season 2010/2011 in the Vienna State Opera Cy Twombly designed the large scale picture (176 sqm) Bacchus as part of the exhibition series Safety Curtain, conceived by museum in progress. In 2011, the Museum Brandhorst, mounted a retrospective of Twombly's photographs from 1951 to 2010. It later was passed over to the Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst at Siegen and the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels.\nTwombly's work went on display as part of Twombly and Poussin: Arcadian Painters at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London from June 29, 2011, less than a week before Twombly's death. The show was built on a quote by Twombly stating that \"I would've liked to have been Poussin, if I'd had a choice, in another time\" and is the first time that his work was put in an exhibition with Poussin. Opening in conjunction with the museum's Modern Wing, Twombly's solo exhibition\u2014Cy Twombly: The Natural World, Selected Works 2000\u20132007\u2014was on display at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2009. The Last Paintings, Twombly's most recent solo exhibition, began in Los Angeles in early 2012. Following the Hong Kong exhibition, it traveled to Gagosian Gallery locations in London and New York throughout 2012. The eight untitled paintings are closely related to the Camino Real group that inaugurated Gagosian Paris in 2010.\n\n\n=== Retrospectives ===\nIn 1968, the Milwaukee Art Museum mounted the first retrospective of his art. Twombly had his next retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1979, curated by David Whitney. The artist was later honored by retrospectives at the Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich in 1987 (curated by Harald Szeemann), the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, in 1988, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1994, with additional venues in Houston, Los Angeles, and Berlin. In 2001, the Menil Collection, the Kunstmuseum Basel, and the National Gallery of Art presented the first exhibition devoted entirely to Twombly's sculpture, assembling sixty-six works created from 1946 to 1998. The European retrospective Cy Twombly: Cycles and Seasons opened at the Tate Modern, London, in June 2008, with subsequent versions at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome in 2009. At the Tate Modern retrospective, a text read:\n\nThis was his first solo retrospective in fifteen years, and provides an overview of his work from the 1950s to now. ... At the heart of the exhibition is Twombly's work exploring the cycles associated with seasons, nature and the passing of time. Several key groups are brought together for the first time, such as Tate's Four Seasons (1993\u201394) with those from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition also explores how Twombly is influenced by antiquity, myth and the Mediterranean, for example the violent red swirls in the Bacchus 2005 paintings which bring to mind the drunken god of wine. The exhibition provides a unique opportunity to see the full range of Twombly's long and influential career from a fresh perspective.\nSome of his work was also shown in an exhibition named Turner Monet Twombly: Later Paintings which ran from June 22 to October 28, 2012, at Tate Liverpool.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nIn 1989, the Philadelphia Museum of Art opened permanent rooms dedicated to his monumental 10-painting cycle, Fifty Days at Iliam (1978), based on Alexander Pope's translation of The Iliad.\nThe Cy Twombly Pavilion of the Menil Collection in Houston, which was designed by Renzo Piano and opened in 1995, houses more than thirty of Twombly's paintings, sculptures, and works on paper, dating from 1953 to 1994. The Museum Brandhorst in Munich holds 170 works including the Lepanto series. The newly opened Broad Collection in Los Angeles holds 22 works.\nIn 1995, The Four Seasons entered the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art as a gift from the artist. A recent (1998\u20131999) Twombly work, Three Studies from the Temeraire, a triptych, was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales for A$4.5 million in 2004. In 2010, Twombly's permanent site-specific painting, Ceiling was unveiled in the Salle des Bronzes at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. He was only the third artist to be invited to contribute in such a way (the other two were Georges Braque in the 1950s and Fran\u00e7ois Morellet in 2010). In 2011, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, made a large acquisition of nine works worth about $75 million. The Bacchus series and five bronze sculptures were given by Twombly's estate to Tate Modern in 2014.\nThe Art Institute of Chicago hosted a two-year exhibition, \"Cy Twombly: Sculpture Selections, 1948\u20131995\". The exhibition featured examples of Twombly's sculptures made between 1948 and 1995, composed primarily of rough elements of wood coated in plaster and white paint. The Institute also holds prints, drawings, and paintings by the artist in its permanent collection.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nTwombly was a recipient of numerous awards. In 1984 he was awarded the \"Internationaler Preis f\u00fcr bildende Kunst des Landes Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\" and in 1987 the \"Rubenspreis der Stadt Siegen\". Most notably, he was awarded the Praemium Imperiale in 1996.\nTwombly was invited to exhibit his work at the Venice Biennale in 1964, in 1989 and in 2001 when he was awarded the Golden Lion at the 49th Venice Biennale. In 2010 he was made Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur by the French government. During fall 2010 Tacita Dean produced a film on Twombly, entitled Edwin Parker.\n\n\n== Cy Twombly Foundation ==\n\nTwombly's will, written under U.S. law, allocated the bulk of the artist's art and cash to the Cy Twombly Foundation. The foundation now controls much of Twombly's work. It has reported $70 million in assets in 2011, and $1.5 billion in the following two years. In 2012 it purchased a 25-foot-wide Beaux Arts mansion on 19 E 82nd St, Upper East Side Manhattan, planning to open an education center and a small museum. There is an additional foundation office on the Gaeta property. The four board members were divided in a lawsuit, settled in March 2014.\nIn 2021, the Cy Twombly Foundation and the Louvre settled a dispute over an unauthorized renovation of Twombly's The Ceiling, the site-specific mural created for the Salle des Bronzes, and announced that the foundation had dropped the lawsuit in exchange for a plan to restore the gallery to the artist's original design.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nIn 1990, a Christie's auction set a record for Twombly, with his 1971 untitled blackboard painting fetching $5.5 million. In 2011, a Twombly work from 1967, Untitled, sold for $15.2 million at Christie's in New York. A new record was made in May 2012 for the 1970 painting Untitled (New York) at Sotheby's, selling for $17.4 million (\u20ac13.4 million). In November 2013 a record price of $21.7 million for Poems to the Sea (1959), an abstract, 24-part multimedium work on paper, was achieved at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Sale.\nA new price record was set at Christie's Contemporary Art Sale on November 12, 2014, an untitled 1970 painting from his Blackboard series with \"lasso-like scribbles\" fetched far beyond the $35 million to $55 million estimate, selling at $69.6 million (\u00a344.3m).\nIn November 2015, New York City (1968) set another new price record for Twombly at $70.5 million. Per Artnet News, \"Covered with his trademark looping white scribbles on a slate-gray background, the work recalls his experience as a cryptologist at the Pentagon.\"\n\n\n== Phaedrus incident ==\nIn 2007, an exhibition of Twombly's paintings, Blooming, a Scattering of Blossoms and Other Things, and other works on paper from gallerist Yvon Lambert's collection, was displayed from June to September at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Avignon. On July 19, 2007, police arrested Cambodian-French artist Rindy Sam after she kissed one panel of Twombly's triptych Phaedrus. The panel, an all-white canvas, was smudged by Sam's red lipstick and she was tried in a court in Avignon for \"voluntary degradation of a work of art\".\nSam defended her gesture to the court: \"J'ai fait juste un bisou. C'est un geste d'amour, quand je l'ai embrass\u00e9, je n'ai pas r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, je pensais que l'artiste, il aurait compris ... Ce geste \u00e9tait un acte artistique provoqu\u00e9 par le pouvoir de l'art\" (\"It was just a kiss, a loving gesture. I kissed it without thinking; I thought the artist would understand .... It was an artistic act provoked by the power of art\").\nThe prosecution described the act as a \"sort of cannibalism, or parasitism\", but admitted that Sam was \"visibly not conscious of what she has done\", asking that she be fined \u20ac4,500 and compelled to attend a citizenship class. The art work was worth an estimated $2 million. In November 2007, Sam was convicted and ordered to pay \u20ac1,000 to the painting's owner, \u20ac500 to the Avignon gallery where it was exhibited, and \u20ac1 to the painter.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General sources ==\nThe Art Institute of Chicago Retrieved May 7, 2015\nCy Twombly: Cycles and Seasons.

He previously in his talks and performances also formed The Party for Animals and The Organisation for Direct Democracy. He was a member of a Dadaist art movement Fluxus and singularly inspirational in developing of Performance Art, called Kunst Aktionen, alongside Wiener Aktionismus that Allan Kaprow and Carolee Schneemann termed Art Happenings. Today, internationally, the largest performance art group is BBeyond in Belfast, led by Alastair MacLennan who knew Beuys and like many adapts Beuys's ethos.\nBeuys is known for his \"extended definition of art\" in which the ideas of social sculpture could potentially reshape society and politics. He frequently held open public debates on a wide range of subjects, including political, environmental, social, and long-term cultural issues.\nBeuys was professor at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf from 1961 until 1972. He was a founding member and life-long supporter of the German Green Party.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and early life in the Third Reich (1921\u20131941) ===\nJoseph Beuys was born in Krefeld, Germany, on 12 May 1921, to Josef Jakob Beuys (1888\u20131958), a merchant, and Johanna Maria Margarete Beuys n\u00e9e H\u00fclsermann (1889\u20131974). Soon after his birth, the family moved from Krefeld to Kleve, an industrial town in Germany's Lower Rhine region, close to the Dutch border. Beuys attended primary school at the Katholische Volksschule and secondary school at the Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve (now the Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium). While in school he developed skills in drawing and took lessons in piano and cello. Other interests included the natural sciences, as well as Nordic history and mythology. By his own account, when the Nazi Party staged their book-burning in Kleve on 19 May 1933 in his school courtyard, he salvaged the book Systema Naturae by Carl Linnaeus \"... from that large, flaming pile\".\nIn 1936, Beuys was a member of the Hitler Youth; the organization at that time included a large majority of German children and adolescents, and later that year membership became compulsory. He participated in the Nuremberg rally in September 1936. He was 15 years old at the time.\nGiven his early interest in natural sciences, Beuys had considered a career in medical studies, but in his last years of school he became interested in pursuing a career in sculpture, possibly influenced by pictures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck's sculptures. In around 1939 he began working part-time at a circus, where his responsibilities included posturing and taking care of animals. He held the job for about a year. He graduated from school in the spring of 1941, having successfully earned his Abitur.\n\n\n=== World War II (1941\u20131945) ===\nAlthough he finally opted for a career in medicine, in 1941, Beuys volunteered for the Luftwaffe, and began training as an aircraft radio operator under the tutelage of Heinz Sielmann in Posen, Poland (now Pozna\u0144). They both attended lectures on biology and zoology at the University of Posen, at that time a Germanized university. During this time he began to consider pursuing a career as an artist.\nIn 1942, Beuys was stationed in the Crimea and was a member of various combat bomber units. From 1943 onward, he was deployed as rear-gunner in a Ju 87 \"Stuka\" dive-bomber, initially stationed in K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, later moving to the eastern Adriatic region. Drawings and sketches from this time have been preserved, and his characteristic style is evident in this early work. \nOn 16 March 1944, Beuys's plane crashed on the Crimean Front close to Znamianka, then Freiberg Krasnohvardiiske Raion. Drawing from this incident, Beuys fashioned the myth that he was rescued from the crash by nomadic Tatar tribesmen, who wrapped his broken body in animal fat and felt and nursed him back to health:\n\n\"Had it not been for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good relationship with them and often wandered off to sit with them. 'Du nix njemcky' they would say, 'du Tartar,' and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in \u2013 I always preferred free movement to safety belts ... My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact \u2013 there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying 'Voda' (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat, and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in.\"\nRecords state that Beuys remained conscious, was recovered by a German search commando, and that there were no Tatars in the village at the time. Beuys was brought to a military hospital where he stayed for three weeks, from 17 March to 7 April. It is consistent with Beuys' work that his biography would have been subject to his own reinterpretation; this particular story has served as a powerful origin myth for Beuys's artistic identity, and has provided an initial interpretive key to his use of unconventional materials, amongst which felt and fat were central.\nDespite prior injuries, he was deployed to the Western Front in August 1944, assigned to a poorly-equipped and trained paratrooper unit. He received a gold Wound Badge for having been wounded in action over five times. On the day after the German unconditional surrender (8 May 1945), Beuys was taken prisoner in Cuxhaven and brought to a British internment camp from which he was released three months later, on 5 August. He returned to his parents who had moved to a suburb of Kleve.\n\n\n=== Studies and beginnings (1945\u20131960) ===\n\nAfter returning to Kleve, Beuys met local sculptor Walter Br\u00fcx and painter Hanns Lamers, who encouraged him to take up art as a full-time career. He joined the Kleve Artists Association, which had been established by Br\u00fcx and Lamers. On 1 April 1946, Beuys enrolled in the monumental sculpture program at the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts. Initially he was assigned to the class of Joseph Enseling, who had a more traditional, representational focus, but he managed to change his mentor after three semesters, joining the small class of Ewald Matar\u00e9 in 1947, who had rejoined the academy the previous year, after having been banned by the Nazis in 1939. The anthroposophical philosophy of Rudolf Steiner became an increasingly important basis for Beuys's philosophy. In his view it is \"...an approach that refers to reality in a direct and practical way, and that by comparison, all forms of epistemological discourse remain without direct relevance to current trends and movements.\" Reaffirming his interest in science, Beuys re-established contact with Heinz Sielmann, and assisted with a number of nature- and wildlife documentaries in the region between 1947 and 1949.\nIn 1947 Beuys, along with other artists (including Hann Trier), founded the group 'Donnerstag-Gesellschaft' (Thursday Group). The group organised discussions, exhibitions, events and concerts between 1947 and 1950 in Alfter Castle.\nIn 1951, Matar\u00e9 accepted Beuys into his master class where he shared a studio with Erwin Heerich, that he kept until 1954, a year after graduation. Nobel laureate G\u00fcnter Grass recollects Beuys's influence in Matar\u00e9's class as shaping \"a Christian anthroposophic atmosphere\". He read Joyce, impressed by the \"Irish-mythological elements\" in his works, the German romantics Novalis and Friedrich Schiller, and studied Galileo and Leonardo, whom he admired as examples of artists and scientists who are conscious of their position in society and who work accordingly.  Early shows include participation in the Kleve Artists Association annual exhibition in Kleve's Villa Koekkoek, where Beuys showed aquarelles and sketches, a solo show at the home of Hans and Franz Joseph van der Grinten in Kranenburg as well as a show in the Von der Heydt Museum in Wuppertal.\nBeuys finished his education in 1953, graduating at age 32 as master student from Matar\u00e9's class. He had a modest income from a number of craft-oriented commissions: a gravestone and several pieces of furniture.  Throughout the 1950s, Beuys struggled both financially and from the trauma of his wartime experiences. His output consisted of drawings and sculptural work. Beuys explored a range of unconventional materials and developed his artistic agenda, exploring metaphorical and symbolic connections between natural phenomena and philosophical systems. Often difficult to interpret in themselves, his drawings constitute a speculative, contingent and hermetic exploration of the material world, myth and philosophy. In 1974, 327 drawings, the majority of which were made during the late 1940s and 1950s, were collected into a group entitled The Secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland (a reference to Joyce), and exhibited in Oxford, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Belfast.\nIn 1956, artistic self-doubt and material impoverishment led to a physical and psychological crisis, and Beuys entered a period of serious depression. He recovered at the house of his most important early patrons, the van der Grinten brothers, in Kranenburg. In 1958, Beuys participated in an international competition for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial. His proposal did not win and his design was never realised. In 1958, Beuys began a cycle of drawings related to Joyce's Ulysses. Completed in around 1961, the six exercise books of drawings would constitute, Beuys declared, an extension of Joyce's seminal novel. In 1959, Beuys married Eva Wurmbach. They had two children, Wenzel (born 1961) and Jessyka (born 1964).\n\n\n=== Academia and public (1960\u20131975) ===\nIn 1961, Beuys was appointed professor of monumental sculpture at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf. His students were artists Anatol Herzfeld, Katharina Sieverding, J\u00f6rg Immendorff, Blinky Palermo, Peter Angermann, Walter Dahn, Johannes St\u00fcttgen, Sigmar Polke and Friederike Weske. His youngest student was Elias Maria Reti who began to study art in his class at the age of 15.\nBeuys entered wider public consciousness in 1964, when he participated in a festival at the Technical College Aachen which coincided with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. Beuys created a performance or action (Aktion) which was interrupted by a group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic CV, which he titled Lebenslauf/Werklauf (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist's life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the 'Exhibition of a wound;' he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out 'at James Joyce's request' \u2013 impossible, given that the writer was long dead by 1961). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys' self-created persona.\nBeuys manifested his social philosophical ideas in abolishing entry requirements to his D\u00fcsseldorf class. Throughout the late 1960s this renegade policy caused great institutional friction, coming to a head in October 1972 when Beuys was dismissed from his post. That year he found 142 applicants who had not been accepted whom he wished to enroll under his teaching. Beuys and 16 students subsequently occupied the offices of the academy to force a hearing regarding their admission. They were admitted by the school, but the relationship between Beuys and the school was irreconcilable. He again occupied the university offices with a group of students; the police were called and he was escorted laughing from the building. This was depicted in a photograph which was used to create a 1973 silkscreen print with the title Democracy Is Funny. Shortly after, he was dismissed from his post. The dismissal, which Beuys refused to accept, produced a wave of protests from students, artists and critics. Although now without an institutional position, Beuys continued an intense schedule of public lectures and discussions, and became increasingly active in German politics. Despite this dismissal, the walkway on the academy's side of the Rhine is named for Beuys. Later in life, Beuys became a visiting professor at various institutions (1980\u20131985).\n\n\n=== Teaching philosophy ===\n\"The most important discussion is epistemological in character,\" stated Beuys, demonstrating his desire for continuous intellectual exchange. Beuys attempted to apply philosophical concepts to his pedagogical practice. Beuys's action, How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare, exemplifies a performance that is especially relevant to the pedagogical field because it addresses \"the difficulty of explaining things\". The artist spent three hours explaining his art to a dead hare with his head covered with honey and gold leaf, and Ulmer argues not only that the honey on the head but the hare itself are models of thinking, of man embodying his ideas in forms. Contemporary movements such as performance art may be considered 'laboratories' for a new pedagogy since \"research and experiment have replaced form as the guiding force\".\nDuring an Artforum interview with Willoughby Sharp in 1969, Beuys added to his famous statement \u2013 \"teaching is my greatest work of art\" \u2013 that \"the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourself you must present something tangible. But after a while this has only the function of a historic document. Objects aren't very important any more. I want to get to the origin of matter, to the thought behind it.\" Beuys saw his role of an artist as a teacher or shaman who could guide society in a new direction.\nAt the D\u00fcsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did not impose his artistic style or techniques on his students; in fact, he kept much of his work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys's actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality and the need for students to take draftsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys's pedagogy included open \"ring discussions\" or Ringgesprache, where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of his ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that \"everyone [was] an artist.\" Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys's students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder and anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.\nBeuys also advocated taking art outside of the boundaries of the (art) system and opening it up to multiple possibilities, bringing creativity into all areas of life. His nontraditional and anti-establishment pedagogical practice and philosophy made him the focus of much controversy, and to battle the policy of \"restricted entry\", under which only a few select students were allowed to attend art classes, he deliberately allowed students to over-enroll in his courses (Anastasia Shartin), true to his belief those who have something to teach and those who have something to learn should come together. \n\n\n=== The artist as shaman ===\nAccording to Cornelia Lauf (1992), \"in order to implement his idea, as well as a host of supporting notions encompassing cultural and political concepts, Beuys crafted a charismatic artistic persona that infused his work with mystical overtones and led him to be called \"shaman\" and \"messianic\" in the popular press.\"\nBeuys had adopted shamanism not only as a presentation mode of his art but also in his own life. Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated \"his art and his life into the shaman role.\" Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate emotions and thus eliminate a major source of energy and creativity. In his first lecture tour in America he espoused that humanity was in an evolving state and that as \"spiritual\" beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to our thinking powers so that \"our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.\"\nBeuys saw his performance art as shamanistic and psychoanalytic to both educate and heal the general public.\n\"It was thus a strategic stage to use the shaman's character but, subsequently, I gave scientific lectures. Also, at times, on one hand, I was a kind of modern scientific analyst, on the other hand, in the actions, I had a synthetic existence as shaman. This strategy aimed at creating in people an agitation for instigating questions rather than for conveying a complete and perfect structure. It was a kind of psychoanalysis with all the problems of energy and culture.\"\nBeuys's art was considered both instructive and therapeutic \u2013 \"His intention was to use these two forms of discourse and styles of knowledge as pedagogues.\" He used shamanistic and psychoanalytic techniques to \"manipulate symbols\" and affect his audience.\nIn his personal life, Beuys had adopted a felt hat, a felt suit, a cane and a vest as his standard look. The imagined story of him being rescued by Tartar herdsmen perhaps is an explanation for his adopting materials like felt and fat. \nBeuys experienced severe depression between 1955 and 1957. After recovering, he observed at the time that \"his personal crisis\" caused him to question everything in life, and he called the incident \"a shamanistic initiation.\" He saw death not only in its inevitability for people, but also death in the environment, and through his art and his political activism,  he became a strong critic of environmental destruction. He said at the time, \"I don't use shamanism to refer to death, but vice versa \u2013 through shamanism, I refer to the fatal character of the times we live in. But at the same time I also point out that the fatal character of the present can be overcome in the future.\"\n\n\n=== National and international recognition (1975\u20131986) ===\n\nThe only major retrospective of Beuys work to be organised in Beuys's lifetime opened at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1979. The exhibition has been described as a \"lightning rod for American criticism,\" eliciting as it did some powerful and polemical responses.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nBeuys died of heart failure on 23 January 1986, in D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\n\n== Body of work ==\nBeuys's extensive body of work principally comprises four domains: works of art in a traditional sense (painting, drawing, sculpture and installations), performance, contributions to the theory of art and academic teaching, and social and political activities.\n\n\n=== Artworks and performances ===\nIn 1962, Beuys befriended his D\u00fcsseldorf colleague Nam June Paik, a member of the Fluxus movement. This began what was to be a brief formal involvement with Fluxus, a loose international group of artists who championed radical erosion of artistic boundaries, bringing aspects of creative practice outside of the institution and into the everyday. Although Beuys participated in a number of Fluxus events, it soon became clear that he viewed the implications of art's economic and institutional framework differently. Indeed, whereas Fluxus was directly inspired by the radical Dada activities emerging during the First World War, Beuys in a 1964 broadcast (from the Second German Television Studio) a different message: Das Schweigen von Marcel Duchamp wird \u00fcberbewertet ('The silence of Marcel Duchamp is overrated'). Beuys's relationship with the legacy of Duchamp and the readymade is a central (if often unacknowledged) aspect of the controversy surrounding his practice.\nOn 12 January 1985, Beuys, together with Andy Warhol and Kaii Higashiyama, became involved in the \"Global-Art-Fusion\" project. This was a fax art project, initiated by the conceptual artist Ueli Fuchser, in which faxes with drawings of all three artists  were sent within 32 minutes around the world \u2013 from D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany) via New York (USA) to Tokyo (Japan), and received at Vienna's Palais-Liechtenstein Museum of Modern Art. This fax event was a sign of peace during the Cold War in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (performance, 1965) ===\n\nBeuys's first solo exhibition in a private gallery opened on 26 November 1965 with one of his most famous performances: How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare. The artist could be viewed through the glass of the gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, and an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he uttered muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings lining the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys sits with the hare, has been described \"by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century,\" though Beuys disagreed with the description.\nBeuys explained his performance this way:\n\n\"In putting honey on my head I am clearly doing something that has to do with thinking. Human ability is not to produce honey, but to think, to produce ideas. In this way the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again. For honey is undoubtedly a living substance. Human thinking can be lively too. But it can also be intellectualized to a deadly degree, and remain dead, and express its deadliness in, say, the political or pedagogic fields. Gold and honey indicate a transformation of the head, and therefore, naturally and logically, the brain and our understanding of thought, consciousness and all the other levels necessary to explain pictures to a hare: the warm stool insulated with felt ... and the iron sole with the magnet. I had to walk on this sole when I carried the hare round from picture to picture, so along with the strange limp came the clank of iron on the hard stone floor\u2014that was all that broke the silence, since my explanations were mute .... This seems to have been the action that most captured people's imaginations. On one level this must be because everyone consciously or unconsciously recognizes the problem of explaining things, particularly where art and creative work are concerned, or anything that involves a certain mystery or question. The idea of explaining to an animal conveys a sense of the secrecy of the world and of existence that appeals to the imagination. Then, as I said, even a dead animal preserves more powers of intuition than some human beings with their stubborn rationality. \nThe problem lies in the word 'understanding' and its many levels, which cannot be restricted to rational analysis. Imagination, inspiration, and longing all lead people to sense that these other levels also play a part in understanding. This must be the root of reactions to this action, and is why my technique has been to try and seek out the energy points in the human power field, rather than demanding specific knowledge or reactions on the part of the public. I try to bring to light the complexity of creative areas.\"\nBeuys produced many such spectacular, ritualistic performances, and he developed a compelling persona whereby he took on a liminal, shamanistic role, as if to enable passage between different physical and spiritual states. Further examples of such performances include: Eurasienstab (1967), Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony (1970), and I Like America and America Likes Me (1974).\n\n\n=== The Chief \u2013 Fluxus Chant (performance, installation, 1963\u20131964) ===\nThe Chief was first performed in Copenhagen in 1963 and in Berlin in 1964. Beuys positioned himself on the gallery floor wrapped entirely in a large felt blanket, and remained there for nine hours. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt, fat, hair, and fingernails. Inside the blanket Beuys held a microphone into which he breathed, coughed, groaned, grumbled, whispered and whistled at irregular intervals, with the results amplified by a PA system as viewers observed from the doorway.\nIn her book on Beuys, Caroline Tisdall wrote that The Chief \"is the first performance in which the rich vocabulary of the next fifteen years is already suggested,\" and that its theme is \"the exploration of levels of communication beyond human semantics, by appealing to atavistic and instinctual powers.\" Beuys stated that his presence in the room \"was like that of a carrier wave, attempting to switch off my own species' range of semantics.\" He also said: \"For me The Chief was above all an important sound piece. The most recurring sound was deep in the throat and hoarse like the cry of the stag....This is a primary sound, reaching far back. ... The sounds I make are taken consciously from animals. I see it as a way of coming into contact with other forms of existence beyond the human one. It's a way of going beyond our restricted understanding to expand the scale of producers of energy among co-operators in other species, all of whom have different abilities[.]\" Beuys also acknowledged the physical demands of the performance. \"It takes a lot of discipline to avoid panicking in such a condition, floating empty and devoid of emotion and without specific feelings of claustrophobia or pain, for nine hours in the same position ... such an action ... changes me radically. In a way it's a death, a real action and not an interpretation.\"\nWriter Jan Verwoert noted that Beuys' \"voice filled the room, while the source was nowhere to be found. The artist was the focus of attention, yet remained invisible, rolled up in a felt blanket throughout the duration of the event...visitors were...forced to stay in the neighboring room. They could see what was happening but remained barred from direct physical access to the event. The partial closing-off of the performance space from the audience space created distance, and at the same time increased the attraction of the artist's presence. He was present acoustically and physically as part of a piece of sculpture, but also absent, invisible, untouchable[.]\" Verwoert suggests that The Chief \"can be read as a parable of cultural work in a public medium. The authority of those who dare \u2014 or are so bold as \u2014 to speak publicly results from the fact that they isolate themselves from the gaze of the public, under the gaze of the public, in order to still address it in indirect speech, relayed through a medium. What is constituted in this ceremony is authority in the sense of authorship, in the sense of a public voice....Beuys stages the creation of such a public voice as an event that is as dramatic as it is absurd. He thus asserts the emergence of such a voice as an event. At the same time, however, he also undermines this assertion through the lamentably powerless form by which this voice is produced: in emitting half-smothered inarticulate sounds that would have remained inaudible without electronic amplification.\" Lana Shafer Meador wrote: \"Inherent to The Chief were issues of communication and transformation .... For Beuys, his own muffled coughs, breaths, and grunts were his way of speaking for the hares, giving a voice to those who are misunderstood or do not possess their own....In the midst of this metaphysical communication and transmission, the audience was left out in the cold. Beuys deliberately distanced the viewers by physically positioning them in a separate gallery room \u2014 only able to hear, but not see what is occurring \u2014 and by performing the action for a grueling nine hours.\"\n\n\n=== Infiltration Homogen for Piano (performance, 1966) ===\nBeuys performed Infiltration Homogen for Piano in D\u00fcsseldorf in 1966. The result was a piano covered entirely in felt with two crosses made of red material affixed to its sides. Beuys wrote: \"The sound of the piano is trapped inside the felt skin. In the normal sense a piano is an instrument used to produce sound. When not in use it is silent, but still has a sound potential. Here no sound is possible and the piano is condemned to silence.\" He also said, \"The relationship to the human position is marked by the two red crosses signifying emergency: the danger that threatens if we stay silent and fail to make the next evolutionary step...Such an object is intended as a stimulus for discussion, and in no way is to be taken as an aesthetic product.\" During the performance he also used wax earplugs and drew and wrote on a blackboard.\nThe piece is subtitled \"The greatest composer here is the thalidomide child\", and attempts to bring attention to the plight of children affected by the drug. (Thalidomide was a sleep aid introduced in the 1950s in Germany. It was promoted to help relieve the symptoms of morning sickness and was prescribed in unlimited doses to pregnant women. However, it quickly became apparent that Thalidomide caused death and deformities in some children of mothers who had taken the drug. It was on the market for less than four years. In Germany around 2,500 children were affected.) During his performance, Beuys held a discussion about the tragedy surrounding Thalidomide children.\nBeuys also prepared Infiltration Homogens for Cello, a cello wrapped in grey felt with a red cross attached, for musician Charlotte Moorman, who performed it in conjunction with Nam June Paik.\nCaroline Tisdall noted how, in this work, \"sound and silence, exterior and interior, are ... brought together in objects and actions as representatives of the physical and spiritual worlds.\" Australian sculptor Ken Unsworth wrote that Infiltration \"became a black hole: instead of sound escaping, sound was drawn into it ... It wasn't as if the piano was dead. I realised Beuys identified felt with saving and preserving life.\" Artist Dan McLaughlin wrote of the \"quiet absorptive silencing of an instrument capable of an infinity of expressions The power and potency of the instrument is dressed, swaddled even, in felt, legs and all, and creates a clumsy, pachyderm-like metaphor for a kind of silent entombment. But it is also a power incubated, protected and storing potential expressions ... pieces like Infiltration showcase the intuitive power Beuys had, understanding that some materials had invested in them human language and human gesture through use and proximity, through morphological sympathy.\"\n\n\n=== I Like America and America Likes Me (performance, 1974) ===\n\nArt historian Uwe Schneede considers this performance pivotal for the reception of German avant-garde art in the United States since it paved the way for recognition of not only Beuys' own work but also that of contemporaries such as Georg Baselitz, Kiefer, L\u00fcpertz, and many others in the 1980s. In May 1974, Beuys flew to New York and was taken by ambulance to the site of the performance, a room in the Ren\u00e9 Block Gallery at 409 West Broadway. Beuys lay on the ambulance stretcher swathed in felt. He shared this room with a coyote for eight hours over three days. At times he stood, wrapped in a thick, grey blanket of felt, leaning on a large shepherd's staff. At times he lay on the straw, at times he watched the coyote as the coyote watched him and cautiously circled the man or shredded the blanket to pieces, and at times he engaged in symbolic gestures, such as striking a large triangle or tossing his leather gloves to the animal; the performance continuously shifted between elements that were required by the realities of the situation and elements that had a purely symbolic character. At the end of the three days, Beuys hugged the coyote that had grown quite tolerant of him and was taken to the airport. Again he rode in a veiled ambulance, leaving America without having set foot on its ground. As Beuys later explained: 'I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.'\nIn 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked I Like America and America Likes Me the second greatest work of performance art ever, after Pandrogeny by Genesis P-Orridge.\n\n\n=== Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony, Celtic+, Agnus Vitex Castus and Three Pots for The Poorhouse (performances 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973) ===\nRichard Demarco invited Beuys to Scotland in May 1970 and again in August to show and perform in the Edinburgh International Festival with G\u00fcnther Uecker, Blinky Palermo and other D\u00fcsseldorf artists plus Robert Filliou where they took over the main spaces of the Edinburgh College of Art. The exhibition was a defining moment for British and European art, directly influencing several generations of artists and curators.\nIn Edinburgh in 1970, Beuys created ARENA for Demarco as a retrospective of his art up to that time, showed his installation The Pack (Beuys) and performed Celtic Kinloch Rannoch with Henning Christiansen and Johannes Stuttgen in support, seen by several thousands. This was Beuys' first use of blackboards and the beginning of nine trips to Scotland to work with Richard Demarco, and six to Ireland and five to England, working mainly with art critic Caroline Tisdall and Troubled Image Group artist Robert McDowell and others in the detailed formulation of the Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research (FIU) presented at documenta 6 in 1977, in London in 1978 and Edinburgh in 1980, as well as in many other iterations.\nIn Edinburgh, at the end of the 1970s the FIU became among four organisations that founded the German Green Party. Beuys became entranced by the periphery of Europe as a dynamic counter in cultural and economic terms to Europe's centralisation, and this included linking Europe's energies North-South to Italy and East-West in the Eurasia concept, with special emphasis on Celtic traditions in landscape, poetry, and myths that also define Eurasia. In his view anything that survives as art and ideas and beliefs, including the great religions for centuries or millennia, contain eternal truths and beauty. The truth of ideas and of 'thinking as form', the sculpture of energies across a wide and variegated spectrum from mythos and spirituality to materialism, Socialism and Capitalism, and of 'creativity = capital' encompassed for him the study of geology, botany, and animal life, finding meanings and precepts in all of these as much as in the study of society, philosophy and the human condition, and in his art practice as 'Social Sculpture'.\nHe adopted and developed a Gestalt way to examine and work with both organic and inorganic substances and human social elements, following Leonardo, Loyola, Goethe, Steiner, Joyce, and many other artists, scientists and thinkers, working with all visible and invisible aspects comprising a totality of cultural, moral and ethical significance as much as practical or scientific value. These trips inspired many works and performances. Beuys considered Edinburgh with its Enlightenment history as a laboratory of inspirational ideas. When visiting Loch Awe and Rannoch Moor on his May 1970 visit to Demarco he first conceived the necessity of the 7,000 Oaks work. After making the Loch Awe sculpture, at Rannoch Moor he began what became the Celtic (Kinlock Rannoch) Scottish Symphony performance, developed further in Basel the next year as Celtic+. The performance in Edinburgh included his first blackboard that later appeared in many performances when in discussion with the public. With it and his Eurasian staff he is a transmitter and, despite long periods of imperturbable stillness interspersed by Christiansen's 'sound sculptures', he also creates dialogue evoking artists' thoughts and in discussion with spectators. He collected gelatin representing crystalline stored energy of ideas that had been spread over the wall. In Basel the action including washing the feet of seven spectators. He immersed himself in water with reference to Christian traditions and baptism and symbolized revolutionary freedom from false preconceptions.\nHe then, as in Edinburgh, pushed a blackboard across the floor alternately writing or drawing on it for his audience.  He put each piece in a tray and as the tray became full he held it above his head and convulsed, causing the gelatin to fall on him and the floor. He followed this with a quiet pause. He stared into emptiness for over half an hour, fairly still in both performances. During this time, he had a lance in his hand and was standing by the blackboard where he had drawn a grail. He took a protective stance. After this he repeated each action in the opposite order, ending with the washing with water as a final cleansing. The performances were filled with Celtic symbolism with various interpretations or historic influences. This extended in 1972 with the performance Vitex Agnus Castus in Naples, of combining female and male elements and evoking much else, and extended further with I Like America and America Likes Me to have a performance dialogue with the original energy of America represented by the endangered yet highly intelligent coyote.\nIn 1974, in Edinburgh, Beuys worked with Buckminster Fuller in Demarco's 'Black & White Oil Conference', where Beuys talked of 'The Energy Plan of the Western Man' using blackboards in open discussion with audiences at Demarco's Forrest Hill Schoolhouse. In the 1974 Edinburgh Festival, Beuys performed Three Pots for the Poorhouse again using gelatin in Edinburgh's ancient poorhouse, continuing the development begun with Celtic Kinloch Rannoch. He met there Tadeusz Kantor directing Lovelies and Dowdies and was at Marina Abramovi\u0107's first ever performance. In 1976, Beuys performed In Defence of the Innocent at the Demarco Gallery where he stood for the imprisoned gangster and sculptor Jimmy Boyle in a manner associating Boyle with the coyote. In 1980 Edinburgh Festival Beuys was at the FIU exhibition and performed Jimmy Boyle Days (the name of the blackboards he used in public discussions), and where he went on a hunger strike as a public protest and led with others in a legal action against the Scottish Justice system. This was the first case under the new European Human Rights Act. The eight performances should be understood as one continuum.\n\n\n=== The concept of \"Social Sculpture\" ===\n\nDuring the 1960s Beuys formed his central theoretical concepts about arts' social, cultural and political function and potential. Indebted to Romantic writers like Novalis and Schiller, Beuys was motivated by a belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident about the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the body of social ideas of Rudolf Steiner, known as Social Threefolding, of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys's devising the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys's most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is \"Everyone is an artist\"). In the video \"Willoughby SHARP, Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues (1974/120 min.)\", a record of Beuys's first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful. In 1973, Beuys wrote:\n\n\"Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build 'A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART' ... EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who \u2013 from his state of freedom \u2013 the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand \u2013 learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.\"\nIn 1982, he was invited to create a work for documenta 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in a stone's new location. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation is perpetuating his project and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones, too.\nBeuys said that:\n\nMy point with these seven thousand trees was that each would be a monument, consisting of a living part, the live tree, changing all the time, and a crystalline mass maintaining its shape, size, and weight. This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument's two parts will never be the same.\n\n\n=== \"Sonne Statt Reagan\" ===\nIn 1982, Beuys recorded a music video for a song he had written entitled \"Sonne statt Reagan\" which translates to \"Sun, not Rain/Reagan\", an anti-Reagan political piece that included some German puns and reinforced some key messages of Beuys's career (at least, after his days as a soldier) \u2013 namely, a liberal, pacifist political attitude, a desire to perpetuate open discourse about art and politics, a refusal to sanctify his own image and 'artistic reputation' by only doing the kinds of work other people expected he would do, and above all an openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the 'art world' was never more clear than it is here.\nBeuys made it clear that he regarded this song as a work of art, not the \"pop\" product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. This becomes clearer when one reads the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the \"Cold War\" to make it \"Hot.\" The song is perhaps best understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, including Americans as well. Some discourse about Beuys by those who consider his body of artwork sacrosanct has avoided \"Sonne statt Reagan\", regarding the video as an outlier, even to be ridiculed. Yet by choosing the vehicle of popular music, Beuys showed commitment to his views and to engage a broad means to have them reach people.\n\n\n=== 7,000 Oaks ===\n\nAmong Beuys's more ambitious pieces of social sculpture was the 7,000 Oaks project, one of enormous scope which met with some controversy.\n\n\n=== Political activities ===\nAmongst other things, Beuys founded (or co-founded) the following political organisations: German Student Party (1967), Organization for Direct Democracy Through Referendum (1971), Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research (1974), and German Green Party Die Gr\u00fcnen (1980). Beuys became a pacifist and a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons; he campaigned for environmental causes (in fact he was elected as a Green Party candidate for the European Parliament). Some of his art directly addressed the political issues of the day among groups with which he affiliated. His song and music video \"Sun Instead of Reagan\" (1982) expresses the theme of regeneration (optimism, growth, hope) running through his life and work as well as his interest in contemporary nuclear politics: \"But we want: sun instead of Reagan, to live without weapons! Whether West, whether East, let missiles rust!\"\n\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe Guggenheim retrospective and catalogue offered a comprehensive view of Beuys's practice and rhetoric to an American critical audience. Although for some time he had been a central figure in the post-war European artistic consciousness, his work to that point had had only fleeting and partial exposure among American audiences. In 1980, building on scepticism voiced by Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers, who in a 1972 Open Letter had compared Beuys to Wagner, art historian Benjamin Buchloh (who was teaching at Staatliche Kunstakademie, just like Beuys) launched a polemically forceful attack on Beuys. The essay was a vitriolic and extensive critique of both Beuys's rhetoric (referred to as \"simple-minded utopian drivel\") and persona (Buchloh regards Beuys as both infantile and messianic).\nFirst, Buchloh notes Beuys' fictionalisation of his own biography, which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency to disavow past trauma and retreat into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh critiques Beuys for failing to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and their implications. Buchloh then criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage with the consequences of the work of Marcel Duchamp, in particular, a failure to acknowledge the framing function of the art institution and the inevitable dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art's power to foster political transformation, Buchloh asserts that Beuys nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks which, he asserts, may serve somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead tried to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, often through dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh's critique has been expounded upon by commentators like Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.\n\n\n=== Rehabilitation ===\nBuchloh's critique has been subject to revision. His attention is given to dismantling a mythologized artistic persona and utopian rhetoric, which he regarded to be irresponsible. Since Buchloh's essay was published, however, much new archival material has come to light, most significantly Beuys' proposal for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial, submitted in 1958. Some argue that the existence of such a project invalidates Buchloh's claim that Beuys retreated from engaging with the Nazi legacy, a point that Buchloh himself has acknowledged, although the charges of romanticism and self-mythologizing remain.\nBeuys' charisma and eclecticism may have polarized some of his audience. His work has attracted admirers and devotees, some who may uncritically accept Beuys' own explanations as interpretive solutions to his work. In contrast, some of those in Buchloh's camp charge Beuys' with weak rhetoric and arguments and dismiss his work as bogus. Relatively few accounts have addressed works themselves, with the exception of scholarship from art historians like Gene Ray, Claudia Mesch, Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes, Briony Fer, Alex Potts, and others. The drive here has been to separate Beuys' work from his rhetoric, and to explore both wider discursive formations within which Beuys operated (this time, productively), and the physical properties of the works themselves.\nExamples of contemporary artists who have drawn from the legacy of Beuys include AA Bronson, former member of the artists' collaborative General Idea, who, not without irony, adopts the subject position of the shaman to reclaim art's restorative, healing powers; Andy Wear whose installations are deliberately formed according to the Beuysian notion of 'stations' and are (in particular, referencing the Block Beuys in Darmstadt) essentially a constellation of works performed or created external to the installation; and Peter Gallo, whose drawing cycle I wish I could draw like Joseph Beuys features stretches of Beuys' writings combined with images traced from vintage gay pornography onto random pieces of paper.\nAdditionally, the counter-institution of the FIU or Free International University, initiated by Beuys, continues as a publishing concern (FIU Verlag) and has active chapters in German cities including Hamburg, Munich, and Amorbach.\n\n\n== Exhibitions and collections ==\n\nFranz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten organized Beuys's first solo show at their house in Kranenburg in 1953. The Alfred Schmela Galerie was the first commercial gallery to hold a Beuys solo exhibition in 1965. Beuys participated for the first time in documenta in Kassel in 1964. In 1969, he was included in Harald Szeemann's groundbreaking exhibition When Attitudes Become Form at the Kunsthalle Bern.\nThe 1970s were marked by numerous major exhibitions throughout Europe and the United States. In 1970, a large collection of Beuys's work formed under the artist's own aegis, the Str\u00f6her Collection, was installed in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt, which remains the most important public collection of his work. Pontus Hult\u00e9n invited him to exhibit at Moderna Museet in 1971. Beuys exhibited and performed at each documenta Kassel, most notably with The Honeypump at the FIU Workplace in 1977 and with 7,000 Oaks in 1982. He showed four times at the Edinburgh International Festival and represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980. In 1980, Beuys took part in a meeting with Alberto Burri at the Rocca Paolina in Perugia, curated by Italo Tomassoni. During his performance, Beuys explained Opera Unica: six blackboards then purchased by the municipality of Perugia and now housed in the Museo civico di Palazzo della Penna in Perugia. A retrospective of his work was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1979. In 1984, Beuys visited Japan and showed various works, including installations and performances, while also holding discussions with students and giving lectures. His first Beuys exhibition took place at the Seibu Museum of Art in Tokyo that same year. The DIA Art Foundation held exhibitions of Beuys' work in 1987, 1992, and 1998, and has planted trees and basalt columns in New York City as part of his 7,000 Oaks, echoing his planting of 7,000 oaks each with a basalt stone, a project begun in 1982 for Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany.  Large collections of his multiples are held by Harvard University, the Walker Art Center Minneapolis, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which also has a collection of Beuys vitrines, The Schellmann and D'Offey collections. Most of the Marx collection of Beuys works including The secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland drawings is at The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum, Berlin. Major art museums in Germany have Beuys works including Fond III at Landesmuseum Darmstadt, while Moechengladbach Museum has the Poor House Doors and much more. Beuys also gave a large collection to the Solidarinosc Movement in Poland. Feuerst\u00e4tte I und Feuerst\u00e4tte II (Hearth I and Hearth II) and other works are at the Museum for Contemporary Art Basel, and a dedicated museum was created for 'The Museum des Geldes' collection mainly of FIU blackboards from Documenta 6. As well, perennial Beuys exhibitions continue to take place around the world.\n\n\n=== Selected exhibitions ===\n\n1964 Drawings & Sculptures 1951\u20131959, Dokumenta 3, Kassel, Germany\n1965 Explaining Pictures to a Dead Hare, Galerie Schmela, Duesseldorf, Germany\n1968 Installation, Dokumenta 4, Kassel, Germany\n1970 Strategy Gets Arts in Edinburgh International Festival, Scotland, Demarco Gallery at Edinburgh College of Art, with The Pack, Arena, and Aktion Celtic Kinloch Rannoch the Scottish Symphony with Henning Christiansen, Edinburgh, UK\n1972 Documenta 5, Kassel, Germany\n1972 Vitex Agnus Castus, Lucio Amelio, Modern Art Agency, Naples, Italy\n1974 Secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland.

Beginning with small woodcuts, they purchased about 4,000 works, creating the largest Beuys collection in the world. In 1967, the 'Beuys Block', a group of first works, was purchased by the collector Karl Str\u00f6her in Darmstadt (now part of the Hessisches Landesmuseum).\nBeuys' artworks have fluctuated in price in the years since his death, sometimes even failing to reach bid minimums. A bronze sculpture titled Bett (Corsett, 1949/50) sold for US$900,000 (hammer price) at Sotheby's New York in May 2008, a record. His Schlitten (Sled, 1969) sold for $314,500 at Phillips de Pury & Company, New York, in April 2012. At the same auction, a Filzanzug (Felt Suit, 1970) sold for $96,100. This surpassed the previous auction record for a Filzanzug, 62,000 euros (US$91,381.80) at Kunsthaus Lempertz (Cologne, Germany) in November 2007. Details and prices of Beuys's works sold at auction are listed by Artsy.\nThe artist produced over 600 original multiples in his lifetime. Large sets of multiples are in the collections of the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, Germany, Harvard University Art Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany. In 2006, the Broad Art Foundation in Los Angeles acquired 570 multiples by Beuys, including a Filzanzug and a Schlitten, thereby becoming the most complete collection of Beuys works in the United States and among the largest collections of Beuys multiples in the world.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeuys (film), a 2017 documentary film\nNever Look Away (film), Beuys is depicted sympathetically during his Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf years in this 2018 German film based loosely on the life of artist Gerhard Richter\nCanadian artist Arnaud Maggs's portrait project Joseph Beuys, 100 Profile Views (1980)\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== Cited sources ==\nRay, Gene, ed.

He was born in St. Louis, Missouri and received a BFA in graphic illustration from Washington University in St. Louis (1988) and an MFA in sculpture from the University of Illinois at Chicago (1990.). As a conceptual artist he works in diverse media including sculpture, painting, drawing, video, and installation.\nFor over twenty years, Friedman has been investigating the viewer/object relationship, and \"the space in between.\" He has held solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York], Yerba Buena Museum of Art, San Francisco, Magasin 3 in Stockholm, Sweden, The New Museum in New York, the Tel Aviv Art Museum, and others. His work can be found in the museum collections of MoMA, Los Angeles Contemporary Art Museum, the Broad Art Museum, the Solomon Guggenheim Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo. Friedman lives and works in Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\n\n== Work ==\nFriedman's sculpture is recognizable for its highly inventive and idiosyncratic use of materials like Styrofoam, foil, paper, clay, wire, plastic, hair, and fuzz. Working autobiographically, he uses painstaking, labor-intensive methods to recreate seemingly random elements from his life. In each piece, he pays obsessive attention to detail, particularly in the replication of the objects that surround him.\nFriedman brings humour and childlike wonder as well as grave philosophical issues to each work. With the art object as departure, he uses everyday, easily understood found materials. He says it's \"enticing and seductive to start with the simple humble object that we all 'think' we know.\" His intent is to draw the viewer into the simple beauty and familiarity of a piece, and then invite them to investigate it further.\nAlthough much of the published work on Friedman's art focuses on the materials, it is ultimately about the tension produced through the phenomenological experience of observer, artwork, and space in between. He often refers to his process as \"orchestrating an experience.\" He uses the art experience as a context for opening people's minds to new ways of seeing, and thinking. To do so, he has developed a circular logic: a way of investigating the object and whittling it down to a core understanding of its metaphor and how it connects to the viewer, in their everyday life, and within societal and philosophical constructs, and then back to the object again.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFriedman worked closely with Feature Inc. for over 15 years. Feature was started in Chicago by Hudson. Friedman eulogized Hudson, saying, \"He understood the development of an artist and their vision. He could see so clearly the evolution of consciousness of an artist, and he knew how to push the work to the next level.\"\nFriedman held his first solo exhibition in 1991 at Feature in New York. Three years later, he made his international debut in an exhibition at the Galleria Rauicci/Santamaria in Naples, Italy and the Galerie Analix in Geneva, Switzerland. His affiliation with Feature at this time led to a relationship with curator Robert Storr, which led to an exhibition in the Elaine Danhessier Project Series at MoMa in the spring of 1995 in tandem with Bruce Nauman's \"Retrospective.\" Friedman was the 50th artist in the series, which focuses on emerging artists. An interview with Storr at this time yielded important information about Friedman's process and circular logic.\nIn 1996 Friedman exhibited with Chuck Close (\"Affinities: Chuck Close and Tom Friedman\") at the Art Institute of Chicago, curated by Madeleine Grynsztejn. In that same year, Friedman participated in exhibitions in France and Italy, also working with curator Paul Schimmel in Brazil for the Sao Paulo Biennale. Notable works from this time period include, Everything (1992\u20131995), 1000 Hours of Staring (1992\u20131997), Untitled (Curse) (1992), Untitled (Aspirin Head) (1994)  and Untitled (Toothpicks) (1995).\nIn 1999 Friedman was one of five resident artists (including Byron Kim, Pauli Apfelbaum, Suzanne McClelland, Lorraine O'Grady) teaching at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Friedman met John Waters, the visiting artist of that year, who later interviewed him for Parkett Magazine. In the interview Friedman spoke of his evolution as an artist over time, as well as the significance behind his art. On the humor of his work, Friedman said, \"there's this misconception that playful thinking is not serious and it's not important.\"\nBetween 2000 and 2002 a major exhibition of his work entitled, \"Tom Friedman: The Epic in the Everyday\", was organized by the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art (SECCA).  The show was exhibited there, and traveled also to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, the Aspen Art Museum, and the New Museum, New York. At this time Friedman was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Prize at the Guggenheim, an honor given to artists deemed the most innovative and influential of the time. In 2002 Friedman was invited to have a solo exhibition at the Fonadzione Prada, Milan, Italy, curated by Germano Celant . A two volume catalogue was produced for the exhibition.\nFriedman held two solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery: \"New Work\" at the Beverly Hills gallery and \"Monsters and Stuff\" in London. Both shows yielded extensive monographs.\nIn recent years, Friedman has built a portfolio of large-scale outdoor installations, beginning with Open Box (2007) and Circle Dance (2011), the latter being permanently installed on Brown University campus in 2012. In 2015, Friedman's Looking Up (2015) was installed on Park Avenue in New York. Another rendition of the 33.3' figure is permanently installed at the Laguna Gloria campus of The Contemporary Austin Texas. Up in the Air, which debuted in 2010 at the Magasin III gallery in Stockholm, marked his first solo exhibition in a Scandinavian country. The installation, consisting of roughly 900 suspended sculptures, continued onto the Tel Aviv Museum of Art between 2014 and 2015. In 2016, Friedman exhibited works for a group exhibition co-curated by Denise Markonish and Sean Foley entitled \"Explode Every Day\" at Mass MoCA, North Adams, Massachusetts.\nThroughout 2016 and 2017 Friedman focused largely on standalone sculptures. Once standing on Park Avenue, Looking Up (2015) was moved to Chicago's lakefront where it will permanently remain. In addition, a third edition of the piece was installed at the James S. McDonnell Planetarium in St. Louis, Missouri. Friedman continued to work in a public forum, unveiling Huddle (2017), a 10x18 foot piece designed for the Dallas Cowboys installed at their training grounds. In late 2017, Friedman had a solo exhibition at Luhring Augustine entitled \"Ghosts and UFOs: Projections for Well-Lit Spaces.\" The show, which consisted solely of projections, was a very dramatic shift from Friedman's previous chronology. While a departure from Friedman's past works, The New York Times praised it as, \"effortlessly brilliant.\" In 2018, Friedman produced a large body of drawings for a solo exhibition at Stephen Friedman Gallery entitled, \"Always The Beginning.\" The show was a reproduction and rendering of notebook pages from Friedman's sketchbooks spanning 30 years prior. In addition, Friedman released a new book of selected notes and sketches to accompany the work.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\nIn an interview with Los Angeles-based writer Dennis Cooper, Friedman spoke in depth on the process and thinking behind much of his art. He revealed to Cooper a disdain for much of his graduate work, which led him to reconsider his image as an artist. \u201cAt this point I sort of dropped the idea of making art; it was more about \"discovering a beginning.\" Friedman remarked. During this time period he completely emptied his studio and created an all white isolation chamber in which he would meditate on objects he brought in from his home. Friedman began at this point to move towards self described radical stages of simplification focusing on the process of his work. In pieces like Untitled (1990), eraser shaving formed into a circle, Friedman focused on repetitive actions which became for him \"almost like a mantra.\" This study of object is also evident in his 1990 writing, Ingredients, a list of all the questions one can ask about an object, organized into three main categories. The object, the location of the object, and the viewer. The questionnaire ended up being twenty pages long.\nIn a 1997 interview with Hudson, Friedman elaborated on his creative process, \"I play both the scientist and the experimental subject...it began as an intellectual process, but is evolving into an emotional understanding.\" Friedman also went on to say, \"In my past work my ideas about change have been more about transformation: the material's transformation from what it is into something different. The ideas surrounding mutation and deviation are interesting to me not only in that they inform the transformation of materials, but also in how they evolve, and depart from each different branch of my investigation\u2026 the different ideas that I explore within a body of work range from ideas that opened things up for me, to unifying ideas that connect my separate branches of investigation.\" Friedman further elaborated on this claim in Irvine Fine Arts Center's, \"Ideas in Things\" in 1999, stating, \"I'm involved in constructing this phenomenon of myself being absorbed by the work in such a way that one or the other of us is going to disappear - it into me or me into it.\"\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nThroughout his career, Friedman has received numerous awards. In 1993 he received both the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award and the Academy Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Friedman also received a grant from The Joan Mitchell Foundation in 2001. Between 1993 and 1995 he was the Luther Greg Sullivan Visiting Artist at Wesleyan University and in 1999 he had a residency at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpting in Skowhegan, ME. In 2013 Friedman received an Honorary Doctorate Degree in the Arts from the Montserrat College of Art.\nFriedman's work has also been the subject of several books, including a feature in an eponymous Phaidon book. Charlotte Eyerman's Friedman: Up in the Air studies the solo exhibition of the same name indepth. Friedman himself has released two books, featuring commentary by Arthur C. Danto, Ralph Rugoff, and Robert Storr, among others. Friedman has been featured extensively in magazines such as Artforum and Frieze.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nInside the Artist's Studio, Princeton Architectural Press, 2015.

He has been described as \"one of the most provocative names in American underground culture,\" and \"the father of remodernist cinema.\"\n\n\n== Early life ==\nJesse Richards was born in New Haven. He had an ambition to be a forest ranger during his teens, which was also the time he started to make films. He studied film production at the School of Visual Arts, New York City, which he left after a nervous breakdown. He directed plays including Hamlet and Look Back In Anger for the New Haven Theatre Company, and made short romance and punk films.\nIn 1999, Richards was arrested for reckless burning, destruction of property and disorderly conduct. After the charges were dropped, he began painting.\n\n\n== Stuckism ==\nRichards is affiliated with the Stuckist art movement in 2001 and founded a gallery as the first Stuckism center in the United States in 2002, helping to organize shows. The center opened its doors with a show entitled \"We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings.\"\nIn 2003, an anti-war \"Clown Trial of President Bush\" took place outside the New Haven Federal Courthouse, in order to \"highlight the fact that the Iraq War does not have the support of the United Nations, thus violating a binding contract with the UN\". It was staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by Richards with Nicholas Watson and Tony Juliano. One of the participants was a public defender for the state of Connecticut.\nSimultaneously the Stuckism center opened a War on Bush show, including work from Brazil, Australia, Germany and the UK, while the London equivalent staged a War on Blair show. Richards said the original intention of a straightforward art show to an anti-war show had been changed after a phone discussion with Stuckism founder, Charles Thomson. Richards told The Yale Herald, \"Duchamp would go over to the Yale University Art Gallery and he would say, 'This is crap,' and he would go paint a picture.\"\n\nAlso in 2003, Richards was an exhibitor in the UK show, Stuck in Wednesbury at Wednesbury Museum & Art Gallery, the first Stuckist show in a public gallery, and in The Stuckists Summer Show at the Stuckism International Gallery, London.\nIn 2004, Richards was one of eight artists in the \"International Stuckists\" section of The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery during the Liverpool Biennial. He said of his exhibited work, Nightlife: \"This came out of heavy drinking and loneliness. New Haven's social scene is entirely going to bars, so it was my only way to meet new people.\"\n\nRichards reviewed the Biennial and the Stuckist show, where he found Joe Machine's My Grandfather Will Fight You, \"one of the best Stuckist paintings. Machine's work is the epitome of raw, real expressive painting.\" He said that Stuckist Photographer Andy Bullock's work was \"silly installation photography\" which was \"trying to be trendy.\"\nIn 2005, 160 paintings from the Walker Art Gallery show, including one by Richards, were offered as a donation to the Tate gallery, but rejected by Sir Nicholas Serota, because \"We do not feel that the work is of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection\".\nIn 2005, Richards was a co-ordinator of, and participated in, Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism, the first Remodernism exhibition in the US to include work from all of the Remodernist groups, including the Stuckists, the Defastenists, Remodernist Film and Photography, and Stuckism Photography. The show took place at the CBGB 313 gallery.\nIn 2006, Richards was one of the artists in The Triumph of Stuckism, a show at Liverpool John Moores University Hope Street Gallery, curated by Naive John at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Research at Liverpool School of Art and Design, and part of the Liverpool Biennial 2006.\nRichards left the Stuckist movement in 2006.\n\n\n== Shows ==\n\nStuckist group shows organized or featuring work by Richards include:\n\n2002 We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings \u2013 New Haven\n2003 War on Bush \u2013 New Haven\n2003 Stuck in Wednesbury \u2013 Wednesbury\n2003 The Stuckists Summer Show \u2013 London\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian \u2013 Liverpool Biennial\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian In the Toilet \u2013 New Haven\n2005 Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism \u2013 New York City\n2006 The Triumph of Stuckism \u2013 Liverpool Biennial\n\n\n== Film and photography ==\nRichards has worked on films with Nicholas Watson since 1996. Their film noir, Blackout, was premiered at the event Stuck Films at the New Haven Stuckism International Center in 2002.\nIn 2003, Richards co-produced Shooting at the Moon, a short film premiering at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. In 2008, the film made its London premiere at Horse Hospital during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Richards said that his films had previously often contained nudity, but this time he wanted to do the opposite and the two leads do not quite even kiss:\n\nWhile making this film I guess the main thing we were thinking about accomplishing was to express this emotional experience, and have people really feel it, and not to get too complicated with story or anything that would distract from this feeling we wanted people to have while watching the film.\nA book of pinhole photography called \"Dark Chamber\", featuring new work by Richards as well as work by Wolf Howard, Billy Childish and others was published by Urban Fox Press in May 2007.\nBrian Sherwin said of Richards that his work was \"Street truth\":\n\nHis work may seem crude to some, but at least it is honest (sometimes brutally honest.) This honesty is captured by his ability to convey human behavior and struggles with each shot from his camera.\nIn February 2010, the Australian film magazine Filmink announced Richards' participation in a compilation feature film by the Remodernist film movement. The film is scheduled to premiere in New York in December 2010.\nIn December 2010, Richards joined the Board of Directors of Cine Foundation International.\nRichards currently lives in Granby, Massachusetts.\n\n\n=== Remodernist film movement ===\n\nIn 2004, Richards and fellow filmmaker Harris Smith co-founded Remodernist Film and Photography, a new Remodernist group attempting to introduce Remodernist/Stuckist values into film and photography.\nIn 2008, Richards published a Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\" and the use of intuition in filmmaking. He described Remodernist film as a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\",. Point four of the manifesto is:\n\nThe Japanese ideas of wabi-sabi (the beauty of imperfection) and mono no aware (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.\nThere were also criticisms of Stanley Kubrick, digital video, and Dogme 95.\nIn late August 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto.  The filmmakers include Jesse Richards, Harris Smith, Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, Peter Rinaldi and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of the Netherlands, Rouzbeh Rashidi of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.\nIn October 2009, with the intention \"to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts\", a series of articles by Richards, Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine MungBeing In Richards' two essays in the magazine, he explains the development of cinema in terms of modernism, postmodernism and remodernism, and discusses remodernist film craft as involving filmmakers \"teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft\". He also relaxes the criticisms made in the manifesto about digital video, claiming that can \"have a place in Remodernist cinema\", but with a \"new language\" and not in the way it is used now, which he says is to \"mimic film\".\nHe describes his specific approach to Remodernist filmmaking as well:\n\n ... my own interests are a little more specific. I'm interested in Japanese aesthetics, Tarkovsky's ideas on \"sculpting in time\", an emphasis on moments. But there's something else I've really been thinking about lately. I believe that the most effective way to really make subjective and authentic work involves an \"addressing of the shadow\" (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, or maybe you are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child.\nThese things, these \"shadows\" that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day \u2013 in our films, in our work, in our poetry. It's necessary for us to share these parts of ourselves so we and the people we share with can grow into complete, honest human beings. Now, this kind of brutal honesty about ourselves shown through imagery that isn't shy, has been explored to a degree in the work from the Cinema of Transgression, and is advocated by Antonin Artaud in his writings about the Theatre of Cruelty, and his later writings on cinema. But I don't think it's quite as simple as just that. As human beings, we are also full of beauty and love and poetry \u2013 we can see this in ourselves and in others and in the world around us. So this beauty must be explored as well, and in combination with the exploration of the shadow. The funny thing is that if we would just be honest as filmmakers, or painters, or as whatever we happen to work with, if we could be this honest, this approach would happen automatically. But we are told again and again- these things don't go together, don't tell people about that thing that you can't get out of your head- that image is inappropriate. We've become very afraid of just expressing ourselves honestly, of removing the desperate attempts to appear clever, we've been afraid of showing our true selves out of fear that others will think us fools. So this is where Artaud, the Cinema of Transgression, and even Andrei Tarkovsky have not gone quite the distance. The cinematic exploration of spirituality and transgression together \u2013 pubic hair, blood and shit and love and the green grass and the dying cherry blossoms, falling snow, passing trains \u2013 every single fucking beautiful piece of life \u2013 that is what my conception of Remodernist film is.\nThe articles also broaden the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nFrank's Wild Years, 1994/1995\nI Wonder, 1996\nSex and Lies, 1998 (destroyed except for trailer)\nBlackout, 2000\nShooting at the Moon, 1998.

He was closely associated with the Vancouver School.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGraham was born in Abbotsford, British Columbia, on January 16, 1949.  He studied art history at the University of British Columbia and subsequently went to Simon Fraser University (SFU).  He intended to concentrate on writing and literature before taking a modern art course taught by Ian Wallace at SFU.\n\n\n== Work ==\nComing out of Vancouver's 1970s photoconceptual tradition, Graham's work is often informed by historical literary, musical, philosophical, and popular references. He was most often associated with other west coast Canadian artists, including Vikky Alexander, Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, Roy Arden, and Ken Lum.  During the late 1970s, he played electric guitar in the band UJ3RK5 with fellow visual artists Wall on keyboards and Ian Wallace on electric bass, among others.  His wide-ranging and often genre-busting work frequently engaged with technologies of the past: literary, psychological, and musical texts, optical devices, and film as a historical medium.\nAmong his earliest works is Camera Obscura (1979; destroyed 1981) a site-specific work that consisted of a shed-sized optical device on his family's farm field near Abbotsford, British Columbia. Entering the shed, the observer was confronted with an inverted image of a solitary tree. Both prior to this (with Rome Ruins [1978]) and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Graham employed the technique of the camera obscura in his work.\nBeginning in the early 1980s, Graham took found texts as the basis for his bookworks \u2013 at once conceptual and material \u2013 inserting bookmarks with additional pages, inserting textual loops, or incorporating books into optical devices in works such as Dr. No* (1991), Lenz (1983), and Reading Machine for Lenz (1993) respectively.  Many of these were carried out with the esteemed Belgian publisher Yves Gevaert and gallerist Christine Burgin.  His extensive body of work related to Sigmund Freud (beginning in 1983) developed out of this text-based practice, though, later, found object books would be integrated unmodified into Donald Judd-like sculptures, for example The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (1987).\nUntil 1997, when he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale with the film loop Vexation Island, Graham was most well known for his series of photographs of Welsh oaks seen upside-down. For this project, he employed a photographer to take black and white negatives of majestic, isolated trees in the English countryside with a large-format camera. He then hung the pictures upside down, like camera obscura images. In 1998 Graham produced his definitive work on this theme, a series of seven monumental images of Welsh oaks printed on color paper to produce warm deep sepia and charcoal hues.\nA postage stamp depicting Graham's photograph, Basement Camera Shop circa 1937 was issued on March 22, 2013, by Canada Post as part of their Canadian Photography series. The image is a recreation of a snapshot discovered by the artist at an antique store. Graham placed himself in the photograph as the owner standing at the counter, waiting for a customer.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1994, Graham began a series of films and videos in which he himself appears as the principal character: Halcion Sleep (1994), Vexation Island (1997) (shown at Canadian pavilion of the 1997 Venice Biennale), How I Became a Ramblin' Man (1999), and The Phonokinetoscope (2002).  In The Phonokinetoscope Graham's engagement with the origins of cinema and its eventual demise surface. In this work, Graham takes up a prototype by Thomas Edison and puts forward an argument for the relation between sound and image in film.\nIn Vexation Island (1997), a shipwrecked sailor, played by Graham, wakes up on a tropical island only to be knocked unconscious by a falling coconut that he has succeeded in shaking out of a palm tree; after a while he reawakens, returns to the tree and the cycle repeats. Later, in Rheinmetall/Victoria 8 (2003), two increasingly obsolete technologies, the typewriter and film projector, face off against one another\u2014with the latter projecting a film of the former.\nThe film Lobbing Potatoes at a Gong (1969) (2006), shot on 16mm and presented as a looped projection, fictitiously documents a 1969 performance strongly reminiscent of the Fluxus movement. The artist, played by Graham, is shown sitting on a chair in the setting of an alternative cultural institution, with an audience watching him trying to hit a gong with potatoes. All the potatoes that actually hit the gong were subsequently used to produce vodka in a small still. The bottle is displayed in a showcase, both as an end product and part of the work. As in many of Graham's films, the relatively simple plot is in stark contrast to the effort that went into the production, with the artist conducting extensive research and hiring a professional film crew.\n\n\n=== Drawing and painting ===\nIn 2003, Graham turned to drawing and painting for the first time. Adopting a persona in a host of related photographic, installation, and painted works, The Gifted Amateur, November 10, 1962, 2007, indicates both continuing performative and art historical directions in his work.\nGraham exhibited a series of film installations with Harun Farocki in 2009, titled \"HF/RG,\" at the Jeu de Paume, Paris.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nGraham's solo exhibitions include the Vancouver Art Gallery (2012); a retrospective at MACBA, Barcelona (2010), travelling to Hamburger Kunsthalle and the Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst, Basel; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2004); Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (2005), Whitechapel Gallery, London (2002), and Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin (2001). The artist was included in documenta IX (1992), the Venice Biennale in 1997, the Whitney Biennial in 2006, and the Carnegie International in 2013.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nGraham represented Canada at the 47th Venice Biennale (1997) and among awards he has received the Gershon Iskowitz Prize, Toronto (2004), the Kurt Schwitters-Preis, Nieders\u00e4chsische Sparkassenstiftung, Germany (2006), and the Audain Prize for lifetime achievement in visual arts, British Columbia (2011). He was short-listed for the Scotia Bank Award in 2014. In 2016, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada for his contributions to Canadian contemporary visual arts.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGraham lived in Vancouver and was married to the artist Shannon Oksanen. Though they had not divorced, she lived separately with her two children and their father. Together they owned Liberty Bakery in Vancouver.\nGraham died on October 22, 2022, in Vancouver.  He was 73, and suffered from cancer in the year prior to his death.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAerodynamic Forms in Space\nSpinning Chandelier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle at thecanadianencyclopedia.ca\nRodney Graham discography at Discogs\nRodney Graham at IMDb", "Peter Reginato (born August 19, 1945), is an American abstract sculptor and painter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nReginato was born on August 19, 1945, in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in Berkeley, California.

Besides painting and drawing, Areal's work involves collage, textile design, and scenography.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAreal was born in Lisbon in 1960, daughter of the painter Ant\u00f3nio Areal (1934-1978) and Maria Lira dos Passos Freitas Pereira (born 1937). She is the second of four sisters. Her father, besides being a painter, wrote several essays plus books on criticism and poetry. The mother, also an artist, has a course in sculpture and currently dedicates herself to drawing. The paternal grandfather, Joaquim Santiago Areal e Silva, was an architect and, together with Jorge Segurado, was one of those responsible for the restoration of national monuments in the 1950s. On the maternal side of the family, from the island of Madeira, the great-grandfather and the grandmother, linked to the arts, had studied in England. Areal grew up between Lisbon, Funchal, Azores and Mozambique.\nAreal began her artistic training in the UK, where she attended the Textile Design course (1978-1979) and the Foundation Course (1979-1980) at the Hertfordshire College of Art & Design in St Albans. Upon returning to Portugal, she attended, between 1981 and 1983, the painting and drawing workshops at AR.CO, in Lisbon. She was a student of Rog\u00e9rio Ribeiro, Ant\u00f3nio Sena and Jos\u00e9 Mouga. Besides painting and drawing, Areal developed her art in the fields of illustration, graphic design and set design. In 1982, she married the sculptor Rui Sanches, with whom she lived for 20 years and with whom she had a son, the artist Martim Brion.\nAlthough she presented her work in group exhibitions throughout the 1980s, it was mainly from the invitation made by Alda Cortez to show at her gallery in 1990 that Areal started a regular dynamic in the public presentation of her works, which she has maintained until the present day.\n\n\n== Work ==\nSofia Areal started her training in England, taking the course in textile design and the foundation course at the Hertfordshire College of Art and Design, St Albans (1979\u201381), before continuing her studies in Portugal at Ar.Co engraving and painting workshops in Lisbon. She has participated in collective exhibitions since 1982 and held individual exhibitions since 1990. In addition to paintings and drawings, she also works in illustration and scenography.\nAreal\u2019s research into forms and light brings painting and drawing into very close proximity where the dividing line mainly appears in the supporting material. Different techniques do not create rupture. Except for oil, acrylic (which she also uses on her canvases) is also involved in her work, in close association with coloured pencils, India ink, watercolours, graphite and collage. While colour is stronger in her painting, it is always present in her drawings, jus as the textured lines of wax crayon or coloured pencil also appear on her canvases. In both forms, she searches for a spatial balance that is seen as a harmony between occupied and empty spaces, opacity and transparency within a graphic game of contrasts, what Sonia Delaunay called simultaneous. Indeed her work and Areal\u2019s share some significant similarities. Created using a vibrant palette dominated by shades of black, white, red and yellow, combined with blues and greens, they create tension with the fragile lines that are superimposed on areas of colour, turning the act of painting and drawing into means of writing and rewriting the world. Her work challenges it, records it and reworks it in bipolar form, bringing us face to face with primordial forces, safe within the maelstrom of her intuitive and immediate creative act, which makes it similar to the Surrealist way of creating. Yet this quality does not eliminate the hesitations surrounding her artistic thinking. The format of the canvases also underlines her research her research into the ways of balancing night and day, Dionysus and Apollo, ranging from rectangles to circular tondos. The latter, cunningly fulfilling their function as targets, establish themselves as metaphors for the attention required by observing and creating. Indeed, apart from the material supports (which in the case of her drawings, are long sheets that already mimic the lined notebooks where people write), the backgrounds also act as a statement of energy, suggesting an Oriental-style precision of complements and completeness. Moreover, the lines or the texture, which appear over these backgrounds in nervy veins whose dynamism is apparent in the funneling or increasing density that manages to metamorphose into areas, underline the presence of those forces and their necessary and wise fruition and effort.\n\n\n== Exhibitions (selection) ==\nSofia Areal has exhibited her work in collective exhibitions since 1982 and individually since 1990.\nSolo Exhibitions (selection):\n2016 \u2013 \u201cRestlessly: Variations on the same theme\u201d, Jo\u00e3o Esteves de Oliveira Gallery, Lisbon, Portugal\n2015 - \u201cHow utterly shameless \u2013 Bite with all the teeth you have in your tongue\u201d, Politecnica Theatre, Artistas Unidos, Lisbon, Portugal\n2014 - \u201c113o 55\u2019E 21o 11\u2019N\u201d, Casa Garden, Macao S.A.R., China.\n2011 - \u201cYES\u201d, anthological exhibition of the last ten years, Cordoaria Nacional, Galeria do Torre\u00e3o Nascente, Lisbon, Portugal.\n2009 \u201cAn Anti-pain practice\u201d, Pr\u00f3-\u00c9vora Group, \u00c9vora, Portugal.\n2006 \u201c360 degrees in the SUN\u201d, Museu de Arte Cont\u00eamporanea do Funchal, now MUDAS Madeira Museum of Contemporary Art, Madeira, Portugal.\n2002 \u201cSofia Areal about Jo\u00e3o Miguel Fernandes Jorge's notebooks\u201d, Casa da Cerca - Contemporary Art Centre, Almada, Portugal.\n2000 \u201cSome of mine mine\u201d, Casa da Cerca - Contemporary Art Centre, Almada, Portugal.\n1993 \u201cPainting and drawing by Sofia Areal\u201d, J.M.

He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1980.\nBernal's aesthetics stemmed from his Cuban birth and the experience of exile and renewal.  His art has been described as modernist, abstract, and expressionist.  The term postmodernist also may be applied to Bernal's diverse and complex body of work, specifically as he rejected the notion of the new in art, a characteristic imbued in postmodern theory.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Life in Cuba ===\n\nA a child, Bernal was privately tutored in art and music. He graduated from Normal Teachers College in 1945 and began teaching at a series of public and private schools in the province of Las Villas. Simultaneously, he enrolled in the Escuela de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas Leopoldo Roma\u00f1ach where he earned his MFA. His musical and visual creations were performed and exhibited in Santa Clara and Havana.\nIn 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Bernal was among the throngs of Cubans arrested for unpatriotic behavior, and was confined for eleven days in the gymnasium of the Marta Abreu University in Santa Clara.  Bernal's offense was refusal to work in the fields cutting sugar cane.  After his release, the threat of execution haunted him and his wife, and they cautiously initiated plans to leave the country with their three young children. It took more than a year to obtain visas. With the help of the Methodist Church, the Bernals were able to board a Pan Am flight for the United States of America in June 1962.\n\n\n=== Life in the United States ===\nThe Bernal family entered the United States at Miami, Florida.  Their stay in the state was brief \u2013 a few months, on account of the scarcity of employment. Subsequently, in autumn of 1962 they relocated to Chicago, Illinois. Bernal confronted the need to support his family and, because of language barriers, became employed in a factory designing artistic materials for commercial purposes. Meanwhile, he continued to produce personal art. Critics observed that his work during this period revealed a transformation affected by the change in geographical environment. While in Cuba his palette did not reflect the brilliant, intense colors of his native land; but in Chicago he began to incorporate the tropical hues of his Caribbean homeland into his art.\nIn 1964, Bernal's art portfolio was reviewed by an executive at Marshall Field's and he was offered a position as Senior Designer. There, the director of Field's fine arts gallery persuaded Bernal to exhibit his impressionist portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Shortly thereafter, Betty Parsons, art dealer, artist, and collector, discovered Bernal's work and began a series of orders to show and sell his paintings at Dayton's art galleries in Minneapolis. The lucrative connection made it possible for Bernal to give up his job at Marshall Field's and return to school where he could pursue his dual dream of teaching and painting.\"\nAfter being granted an MFA evaluation by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970, Bernal returned to teaching art while continuing to create and exhibit his works. Lydia Murman, art critic of the New Art Examiner, wrote about Bernal's 1981 solo exhibition of collage and assemblage: \"Bernal's works involve the viewer because they resurrect the concern for art as a communicative force. The viewer reacts to the classical arrangement, in which found objects are manipulated with a respect for their physical properties and for their potential symbolic value. While warm wood, old newspaper print, tarnished metal, and antique objects produce an aura that absorbs the viewer and stirs archetypal images within his subconscious, some works, such as \"Balancing the Unbalanced,\" in which a faucet is perceived as a faucet, invite the viewer to open the dialogue concerning substance and illusion, art and reality.\"\n\nAlthough Bernal and his family didn't realize it, the first signs of Parkinson's disease began to appear during the 1980s, and he was eventually diagnosed in 1993. He continued to work, to move forward and fight back against the ravages of the disease. In 2004, Bernal donated a number of his paintings to the National Parkinson Foundation in Miami, Florida, which auctioned them off to benefit the foundation. Bernal's tremendous contribution eventually expanded to some 300 works of art.\"\nBernal's work is annotated in two books by Dorothy Chaplik on Latin American art: Latin American Arts and Cultures and Defining Latin American Art/Hacia una definici\u00f3n del arte latinoamericano. In her essay The Art of Jos\u00e9 Bernal she discusses Bernal's oeuvre, and describes his artistic process as he traversed life's challenges, including political unrest in Cuba, his personal battle with Parkinson's disease, and his passion for his art.\nBernal died of complications from Parkinson's disease on April 19, 2010, at his home in Skokie, Illinois. Documents on his life and art are archived in the Institute for Latino Studies of the Julian Samora Library at the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana.\n\n\n== Museum collections ==\nBernal has artwork in a number of permanent collections, including:\n\nSan Antonio Museum of Art, San Antonio, Texas\nTucson Museum of Art and Historic Block, Tucson, Arizona\nAsheville Art Museum, Asheville, North Carolina\nCameron Art Museum, Wilmington, North Carolina\nMcNay Art Museum, San Antonio, Texas\nMary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Evanston, Illinois\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\nInstitute for Latino Studies/University of Notre Dame, Indiana\nArt Museum of the Americas, OAS, Washington, D.C.\nEl Museo del Barrio, New York City\nDePaul Art Museum, Chicago, Illinois\nLoyola University Museum of Art, Chicago, Illinois\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid, Spain\nRetrospectives of Bernal's work include those at:\n\nCameron Art Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBernal Monograph in artnet\nBernal in AskART\nBernal in LatinAmericanArt.com\nBernal in artprice\nSan Antonio Current: Picasso's Guernica tapestry riots amid works of political conscience.\ncubaencuentro|cultura: Artistas cubanos en el medio oeste de EEUU.\nJos\u00e9 Bernal obituary in the Chicago Tribune\nBernal: Richard Norton Gallery\nGetty Union List of Artists (Research at the Getty)\nJos\u00e9 Bernal: Smithsonian American Art Museum Research Database\nJos\u00e9 Bernal: Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery Catalog of American Portraits\nView works in Museum and Public Collections\nArt Museum of the Americas\nAsheville Art Museum\nMcNay Art Museum, one of two collages by Jos\u00e9 Bernal in its collection.

The family returned to Poland in 1946 and Opa\u0142ka studied lithography at a graphics school before enrolling in the School of Art and Design in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. He later earned a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. He moved back to France in 1977. Opa\u0142ka lived in Teille, near Le Mans, and Venice. He died at age 79 after falling ill while on holiday in Italy. He was admitted to a hospital near Rome and died there a few days later, on 6 August 2011.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nIn 1965, in his studio in Warsaw, Opa\u0142ka began painting numbers from one to infinity. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the canvas and finishing in the bottom right-hand corner, the tiny numbers were painted in horizontal rows. Each new canvas, which the artist called a \"detail\", took up counting where the last left off. Each \"detail\" has the same size (196 \u00d7 135 cm), the dimension of his studio door in Warsaw. All details have the same title, \"1965 / 1 \u2013 \u221e\"; the project had no definable end, and the artist pledged his life to its ongoing execution: \"All my work is a single thing, the description from number one to infinity. A single thing, a single life\", \"the problem is that we are, and are about not to be\". He had contemplated and tried many different ways to visualize time before settling on this life's work.\nOver the years there were changes to the process. In Opa\u0142ka's first details he painted white numbers onto a black background. In 1968 he changed to a grey background \"because it's not a symbolic colour, nor an emotional one\", and in 1972 he decided that he would gradually lighten this grey background by adding 1% more white to the ground with each passing detail. He expected to be painting virtually in white on white by the time he reached 7777777 (he did not use commas or number breaks in the works): \"My objective is to get up to the white on white and still be alive.\" As of July 2004, he had reached 5.5 million. Adopting this rigorously serialized approach, Opa\u0142ka aligned himself with other artists of the time who explored making art through systems and mathematics, like Daniel Buren, On Kawara, and Hanne Darboven. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert and in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo.\nIn 1968 Opa\u0142ka introduced to the process a tape recorder, speaking each number into the microphone as he painted it, and also began taking passport-style photographs of himself standing before the canvas after each day's work.\nIn 2007 Opa\u0142ka participated at the symposium \"Personal Structures Time\u2013Space\u2013Existence\" a project initiated by the artist Rene Rietmeyer.\nThe final number he painted was 5607249.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nOpa\u0142ka participated in many of the art world\u2019s most important international exhibitions, including Documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1977; the S\u00e3o Paulo Bienal in 1987; and the Venice Biennale, in 1995, 2003, 2011 and 2013. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert, in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo and, for many years, at John Weber in New York.\nIn 2003, Les Rencontres d'Arles exhibited his work through \"L\u2019\u0153uvre photographique\"'s exhibition (the curator was Alain Julien-Laferri\u00e8re).\nIn 2017, Opa\u0142ka has made part of the exhibition \"Il mio corpo nel tempo / L\u00fcthi Ontani Opalka\", Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Verona 2017. Catalogue Manfredi Edizioni.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nOpa\u0142ka's works can be found in the permanent collections of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art among others.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOpa\u0142ka won the celebrated Grand Prize of the 7th International Biennial of Arts and Graphics of Cracow in 1969, the C. K. Norwid Art Critics Award in 1970, France\u02bcs National Painting Prize in 1991 and Germany\u02bcs Goslarer Kaiserring in 1993. He was named Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and of Letters) in France. In 2009, he was awarded Medal for Merit to Culture \u2013 Gloria Artis by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski. In 2011, the President of Poland Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski awarded him with Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 2011 Opalka was awarded by the European Cultural Centre Art Award for his life long depiction of \"Time Passing\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2005 the German art project \"Camera Obscura 2005/1-\u221e\" was initiated as an homage to Opa\u0142ka's life and work. It honours his \"1965 / 1 \u2013 \u221e\" work by selling camera obscuras \u2014 with two pinholes \u2014 over the internet auction platform eBay. Each pinhole is sold to another buyer, and the camera is subsequently sent back to the project to be developed and exhibited in its gallery, as well as online.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\n\"Roman Opa\u0142ka\". Katarzyna Napi\u00f3rkowska. Archived from the original on 2016-03-04.", "Allan McCollum (born 1944) is a contemporary American artist who lives and works in New York City. In 1975, his work was included in the Whitney Biennial, and he moved to New York City the same year. In the late 1970s he became especially well known for his series, Surrogate Paintings.\nHe has spent over fifty years exploring how objects achieve public and personal meaning in a world caught up in the contradictions made between unique handmade artworks and objects of mass production, and in the early 1990s, he began focusing most on collaborations with small regional communities and historical society museums in different parts of the world. His first solo exhibition was in 1970 and his first New York showing was in a group exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1972.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMcCollum was born in The California Hospital in Los Angeles on August 4, 1944. In 1946, his family moved to Redondo Beach, California, where his three siblings were born, and where he lived until 1966. Both of his parents and many others in his family were active in the arts. His father, Warren McCollum, the son of an actress in New York and a child actor himself, performed a number of small parts on the Broadway stage and a few small roles in movies in the late 1930s and early 1940s, including the role of Jimmy Lane in the 1938 cult classic, Reefer Madness. He remained active in local theater groups throughout much of his life, while working as a security guard at a local research corporation. Allan McCollum's mother, Ann Hinton, the daughter of a piano teacher and a cartographer, also performed regularly as an actress and singer in local theater productions, and as a piano accompanist to a local voice teacher. His mother's brother, Sam Hinton, was a well-known folk singer and folk music historian in Southern California, and his mother's sister's husband was Jon Gnagy, the popular television art instructor who between 1946 and 1970 had the longest continuously running show on television.\n\n\n== Education and early career ==\n\nIn 1964, McCollum moved to Essex, England, pursuing the idea of being an actor, and joined a local theater group in Southend-on-Sea, but he changed his mind about a career in theater and returned to California in 1965, moved into a small mobile home park in Venice Beach, California, and attended Los Angeles Trade Technical College for five months, attempting to learn the trade of restaurant management and industrial kitchen work. For two years, he worked for Trans World Airlines at the Los Angeles International Airport, preparing meals for flights but, in 1967, he decided to educate himself as an artist. He learned quickly, influenced initially by reading the writings of the Fluxus artists and the early structuralists, and found a job as a truck driver and crate-builder for an art handling company in West Hollywood. Through this job he met many artists, art dealers, art collectors and museum curators, learning much about the contemporary art world. During the late 1960s, McCollum produced his early work while living in small rented storefront spaces, first in Venice Beach, and later in Santa Monica. In 1970, he established a studio in a converted parking garage in Venice Beach, where he lived and worked until 1975. During these years, he exhibited his work regularly at the Nicholas Wilder Gallery and also at the Claire Copley Gallery, both in Los Angeles. His work was shown in a number of museum group exhibitions, including shows at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Pasadena Art Museum, the Long Beach Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Oakland Museum, the San Francisco Art Institute, the Seattle Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Krannert Art Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In late 1975, he moved to the SoHo district of New York City, where he initially worked as a guard at the Whitney Museum.\n\n\n== Exhibition history ==\n\nMcCollum has had over 140 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne in Lille, France (1998), the Sprengel Museum in Hannover, Germany (1995\u201396), the Serpentine Gallery in London (1990); the Rooseum Center for Contemporary Art in Malmo, Sweden (1990), IVAM Centre del Carme in Valencia, Spain (1990); Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, The Netherlands (1989) and Portikus in Frankfurt, Germany (1988).\nHe participated in the Aperto at the Venice Biennale in 1988 and 2012. In 2008, McCollum exhibited 1,800 drawings from his 1988-91 Drawings project at the 28th Bienal de S\u00e3o Paulo in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. His works have been exhibited in the United States White House. He has produced numerous public art projects in the United States and Europe, and his works are held in over ninety art museum collections worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\n\nMcCollum's family history, his experiences and training at working in industrial kitchens, and his interest in theater and Fluxus, including \"task-oriented\" performance art, offered him a unique take on labor and art, and the methods and systems of quantity-production showed themselves in his artwork from the beginning. He is known for utilizing the methods of mass production in his work in many different ways, often creating thousands of objects that, while produced in large quantity, are each unique. In 1988-91, he created over 30,000 completely unique objects he titled Individual Works, which were gathered and exhibited in collections of over 10,000. The objects were made by taking many dozens of rubber molds from common household objects\u2014like bottle caps, food containers, and kitchen tools\u2014and combining plaster casts of these parts in thousands of possible ways, never repeating a combination. In 1989, he used a similar system to create thousands of handmade graphite pencil drawings, using hundreds of plastic drafting templates he designed for this purpose, each drawing made unique by combining the templates according to a combinatorial protocol that never repeated itself.\n\nBeginning in the early 1990s, McCollum expanded his interests in quantity production to include explorations into the ways regional communities give meaning to local landmarks and geological oddities in establishing community identity, and collaborated with a number of small towns and small historical museums in Europe and the United States, bringing attention to the way local narratives develop around objects peculiar to geographic regions, and drawing comparisons to the way artworks develop meaning in a parallel manner. Often these projects involved reproducing local objects in quantity, or creating models or copies of local artifacts and symbols. In 1995, he collaborated with the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum in Price, Utah, to make replicas of its entire collection of dinosaur track casts, and exhibited these in New York and Europe. In 1997, he collaborated with the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing in Starke, Florida, to trigger lightning with rockets and worked with a local souvenir manufacturer to create over 10,000 replicas of a fulgurite created by the lightning strike. In 2000, he collaborated with the Pioneers Museum in the desert community of Imperial Valley, California, to reproduce souvenir copies and large models of its local mountain, Mount Signal, and the unique \"Sand Spike\" sand concretions found at its base. In 2003, he created 120 topographical models of the states of Missouri and Kansas, which he donated and delivered himself to 120 small historical society museums in both states.\n\nIn 2005, McCollum designed The Shapes Project, a combinatorial system to produce \"a completely unique shape for every person on the planet, without repeating.\" The system involves organizing a basic vocabulary of 300 \"parts\" which can be combined in over 30 billion different ways, created as \"vector files\" in a computer drawing program. McCollum has used the system in collaborations with a community library, schoolchildren, home craftworkers, writers, architects and other artists, as the Shapes are created to be used for many different kinds of projects, and so far have been produced in the form of both prints and sculpture, in Plexiglas, Corian, plywood, hardwoods, metals, rubber and fabric, in a variety of sizes. In 2010, he published The Book of Shapes, in collaboration with mfc-mich\u00e8le didier. This book makes the Shapes Project complete. The first volume contains the 300 shapes \"parts\" and the second includes the guides and instructions for creating all possible combinations with these components. The same year, he organized the Shapes for Hamilton project, in which a unique signed and dated Shapes print was made for each of the 6,000+ residents of the township of Hamilton, New York.\nHe has been a recipient of an NEA Special Project Grant and an Individual Support Grant from the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation.\n\n\n== Collaborations and writings ==\nMcCollum has occasionally collaborated with other artists in producing projects, including Louise Lawler (1983, 1984, 1988, 1996), Andrea Fraser (1991), Laurie Simmons (1984), Matt Mullican (2004), Andrea Zittel (2007), Allen Ruppersberg (2008), Pablo Helguera (2014), Astrid Preston and Cynthia Daignault (2016). He has also written texts and interviewed fellow artists for books and catalogs, including Matt Mullican (1979 and 2006) Allen Ruppersberg (1999), Andrea Zittel (2001), Roxy Paine (2002), and Harrell Fletcher (2005).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nNicolas Bourriaud, \"McCollum's Aura\", New Art International, October 1988.\nLynne Cooke, Selma Klein-Essink and Anne Rorimer, Allan McCollum, Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, 1989; in Dutch and English.\nHal Foster, \"Subversive Signs\", Recoding: Art, Spectacle, Cultural Politics, Seattle Bay Press, 1986.\nAndrea Fraser, K\u00f6nig, Kasper and Wilmes, Ulrich: Allan McCollum, Portikus, Frankfurt, Germany.

(9 hr., 38 min.)", "Leon Golub (January 23, 1922 \u2013 August 8, 2004) was an American painter. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he also studied, receiving his BA at the University of Chicago in 1942, and his BFA and MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 and 1950, respectively.\nHe was married to and collaborated with the artist Nancy Spero (August 24, 1926 \u2013 October 18, 2009). Their son Stephen Golub was an economics professor at Swarthmore College. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal Le Monde diplomatique. Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the University of Chicago in 1942. Then he was enlisted in the army. From 1947 to 1949, he studied under the G.I. Bill at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub\u2019s one-time flatmate Cosmo Campoli, George Cohen, Theodore Halkin and Seymour Rosofsky, whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age. It was at SAIC that he met the artist Nancy Spero, to whom he was married for nearly fifty years. Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948\u20131949, put together by SAIC and Institute of Design students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute\u2019s prestigious \"Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity.\" He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute\u2019s \"Veteran's Exhibition\" of 1948. The group included, in addition to Golub\u2019s aforementioned classmates, June Leaf, H.C. Westermann, Irving Petlin, Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and Arthur Lerner.\nIn Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the \"Monster Roster\" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, expressive figuration, fantasy and mythology, and existential thought. They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub's work throughout his career.\nGolub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s, when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955, ARTnews article, \"Is There a New Chicago School?\", and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, New Images of Man, as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States. In later years, the Monster Roster would be regarded as forerunners to the more widely known Chicago Imagists.\n\n\n== Career ==\nGolub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a meat cleaver, leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched.\nFrom 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife, artist Nancy Spero opted to live in Paris, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using lacquer to acrylics, left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy for the year of 1956, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of Etruscan and Roman art, whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.\nWhen Golub returned to New York State from Paris in 1964, the Vietnam War was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam, works that show the vulnerability of the body while also demonstrating the power of modern weapons. Golub's work for his Vietnam paintings were at first titled Assassins, eventually being changed to not attribute the intention of the soldiers. One of his longest works would include that of Vietnam II, with it stretching over twelve meters. He and Spero became active with Artists and Writers Protest, \"the first such group to take a public stand against the war\". This group would be centered around the organization of anti war activities. In 1967, as part of the group's Angry Arts Week, Golub organized The Collage of Indignation, a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as \"not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion.\"\nGolub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art's \"New Images of Man\" show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock.\nIn the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt caused by a lack of interest in his work. Between the years of 1974 to 1976, Golub would cut up and destroy many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, over the course of three years he would produce more than a hundred portraits of public figures, with sixty of those portraits having been completed between February and September 1976. His interest in creating these portraits would stem from a resemblance between a young Gerald Ford and a soldier from one of his works, Vietnam III. Among the portraits were political and military leaders, dictators, and religious figures. Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000 includes several portraits of Nelson Rockefeller and Ho Chi Minh, along with images of Fidel Castro, Francisco Franco, Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger. Some of these portraits were included in the display 'Leon Golub: Political Portraits' (2016) at the National Portrait Gallery, London.\nIn the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series Mercenaries, Interrogation, Riot, and Horsing Around.  His Interrogation II (1981; Art Institute of Chicago) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub's technique, \"the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface.\"\nFrom the nineties to his death, Golub's work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary graffiti. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons.\nGolub's work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them World Wide (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. For World Wide the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer. He was represented in many group exhibitions and was one of the few white artists included in Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1994.\nIn 1996, Golub was given a commission to design a set of stained glass windows for Temple Sholom in Chicago, the four windows depict the life of Joseph. These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.\n\n\n== 2001: renaissance ==\nWhile Leon Golub's later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words \"left-over\") reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, Reclining Youth, part of a series of paintings inspired by friezes at the Great Altar of Zeus in Pergamon. Working with Magnolia Editions, the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [14-foot-wide (4.3 m)] Jacquard tapestry, his first and only textile work.\n\n\n== Retrospectives ==\nFrom March to May 2015, the Serpentine Gallery in London held a career retrospective which was \"spun off\" and presented as a three-floor career retrospective at the Manhattan Hauser & Wirth in June 2015. In 2022, the Hall Art Foundation, in Reading, Vermont presented a major survey of approximately 70 Golub works from the Hall and Meyer Collections spanning Golub\u2019s career from 1947 to 2003, which traveled to Kunstmuseum Schloss Derneburg in 2023.\n\n\n== Collections, selected ==\n\n\n=== Selected public collections ===\n\n\n=== Selected private foundations ===\nEli Broad Family Foundation, Los Angeles, California\nHall Collection\n\n\n=== Selected private collections ===\nSaatchi Collection, London\nGene R.

Her directorial feature film debut was 2009's Nowhere Boy, a film based on the childhood experiences of the Beatles' singer and songwriter John Lennon. She is one of a group of artists known as the Young British Artists.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSamantha Taylor-Wood was born in Croydon, London. Her father, David, left the family when she was nine. Her mother, Geraldine, is a yoga teacher and astrologist. She has a younger sister, Ashley, and a maternal half-brother, Kristian.\nTaylor-Wood grew up near Streatham Common in south London until her parents' divorce. The family then moved into an old schoolhouse in Jarvis Brook in East Sussex, and Samantha went to Beacon Community College. She later attended Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Fine art ===\nTaylor-Wood began exhibiting fine-art photography in the early 1990s. One collaboration with Henry Bond, titled 26 October 1993, featured Bond and Taylor-Wood reprising the roles of Yoko Ono and John Lennon in a pastiche of the photo-portrait made by photographer Annie Leibovitz\u2014a few hours before Lennon was assassinated, in 1980.\nIn 1994, she exhibited a multi-screen video work titled Killing Time, in which four people mimed to an opera score. From that point multi-screen video works became the main focus of her work. Beginning with the video works Travesty of a Mockery and Pent-Up in 1996. One of Taylor-Wood's first United Kingdom solo shows was held at the Chisenhale Gallery, east London, in September\u2013October 1996. She was nominated for the annual Turner Prize in 1998, but lost out to the painter Chris Ofili. She won the Illy Caf\u00e9 Prize for Most Promising Young Artist at the 1997 Venice Biennale.\nIn 2000, she created a wraparound photomural around scaffolding of the London department store Selfridges while it was being restored; the mural featured 21 cultural icons including Elton John, musician Alex James, and actors Richard E. Grant and Ray Winstone. The poses of the figures referenced famous works of art from the past and recent movies.\nIn 2002, Taylor-Wood was commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery to make David, a video portrait of David Beckham\u2014whom she depicted sleeping. She is perhaps best known for her work entitled 'Crying Men' which features many of Hollywood's glitterati crying, including Robin Williams, Sean Penn, Laurence Fishburne and Paul Newman. In 2006, she had a survey exhibition at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, England.\n2014 saw a new photographic exhibition by Taylor-Johnson, of the private apartment of Mademoiselle Chanel at The Saatchi Gallery. Entitled \u2018Second Floor,' the series of 34 photographs captured the private rooms of Coco Chanel at 31 Rue Cambon in Paris.\n\n\n=== Nowhere Boy ===\nIn August 2008, she was chosen to direct Nowhere Boy, a biopic about the childhood of John Lennon. Speaking about her experience directing the film, in September 2010, she said,\n\n\"I thought, I'm in too deep and if I mess this up I'm just never gonna make a film again, and I went into a panic. I got into the car and said, I just have to call these producers and pull out. I got into the car and I put the key into the ignition and Lennon's voice came straight out of the radio and it was Starting Over. It was one of those moments where I thought it was a sign: OK I'm gonna do it.\"\nThe 53rd annual London Film Festival screened the film as its closing presentation on 29 October 2009. The film was released in the UK on Boxing Day in 2009 to positive reviews. she was nominated for a BAFTA award on 21 January 2010 but lost, to Duncan Jones.\n\n\n=== Other music, film and television work ===\nIn her 2004 film installation \"Strings\" at White Cube, ballet dancer Ivan Putrov was suspended by a harness above four musicians playing the slow movement from Tchaikovsky's Second String Quartet, filmed in the Crush Bar of the Royal Opera House. In 2006, she contributed the short film Death Valley to the British version of Destricted. In July 2006 she was appointed as a Governor of the British Film Institute.\nIn 2008, she directed a short film Love You More, written by Patrick Marber and produced by Anthony Minghella. The film includes two songs by the Buzzcocks and features a cameo appearance by the band's lead singer Pete Shelley. In February 2009, Taylor-Wood, collaborating with Sky Arts chose to interpret \"Vesti la giubba\" from Pagliacci. She commented: \"I\u2019m really happy to be involved in such a great project. I think by capturing one of opera's most moving moments in a film short, we have put a modern spin on the aria.\"\nIn 2011, she directed the R.E.M. music video \"\u00dcberlin\". The clip starred her then-fianc\u00e9 Aaron Johnson, who \"throws some kung-fu kicks, attempts some pirouettes, prances, punches the air, chicken walks, tries out some bunny impressions, and, at one point, fondles his bottom.\"\nIn September 2011, she collaborated with Solange Azagury-Partridge on the short film Daydream. This was aired to support the launch of Azagury-Partridge's new jewellery collection, 24:7. Under the direction of Taylor-Wood, Liberty Ross plays a beautiful woman in her bedroom, bejewelled by her lover, played by JJ Feild. The original music was composed by Oscar winner Atticus Ross, and the director of photography was BAFTA winner John Mathieson.\nTaylor-Johnson directed the film adaptation of E. L. James' best-selling erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, made by Universal Pictures and Focus Features. She was chosen from a list that included Angelina Jolie, Steven Soderbergh, Ryan Murphy, Joe Wright, and Gus Van Sant. Taylor-Johnson was in pole position to direct Fifty Shades Darker (the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey), but decided to walk away from the much-discussed franchise after she was involved in a number of disagreements with author E.L. James. In June 2017, Taylor-Johnson said that she regretted directing the first film.\nIn March 2021, Taylor-Johnson was announced to have been attached to direct and produce a biographical drama called Rothko, based on the Rothko case.

He is noted especially for his installations, many of which express resistance to political oppression in Brazil. These works, often large and dense, encourage a phenomenological experience via the viewer's interaction.\n\n\n== Life ==\nMeireles was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1948. From an early age, Meireles showed a keen interest in drawing and spatial relations. He was especially interested in how this has been explored in animated film. His father, who encouraged Meireles' creativity, worked for the Indian Protection Service and their family traveled extensively within rural Brazil.\nIn an interview with Nuria Enguita, Meireles described a time when he was \"seven or eight\" and living in the countryside that had a huge impact on him. He said that he was startled by an impoverished man wandering through the trees. The next day, the young Meireles went to investigate, but the man was gone and only a small but perfect hut the man had apparently made the night before remained. Meireles said that this hut \"was perhaps the most decisive thing for the path [he] followed in life...The possibility one has of making things and leaving them for others.\"\nDuring his time in rural Brazil, Meireles learned the beliefs of the Tupi people which he later incorporated into some of his works in order to highlight their marginalization in, or complete disappearance from, Brazilian society and politics. Installations which contain allusions to the Tupi include Southern Cross (1969\u201370) and Olvido (1990). Meireles cites Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast The War of the Worlds as one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century because it \"seamlessly dissolved the border between art and life, fiction and reality.\" Recreating this concept of total audience investment was an important artistic goal of Meireles that is seen throughout his body of work.\nHe began his study of art in 1963 at the District Federal Cultural Foundation in Brasilia, under the Peruvian painter and ceramist Felix Barrenechea. In the late 1960s, Meireles discovered the work of H\u00e9lio Oiticica and Lygia Clark, thereby introducing him to the Brazilian Neo-Concrete movement. These artists, as well as Meireles, were all concerned with blurring the boundary between what is art and what is life, and responding to current political situations within their pieces.\nMeireles unintentionally participated in a political demonstration in April 1964, when he was sixteen years old. He has cited this moment has his \"political awakening\" and began to take an interest in student politics. In 1967 he moved to Rio de Janeiro and studied at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes.\nMeireles currently lives and works in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMeireles has stated that drawing was his main artistic medium until 1968, when he altogether abandoned expressionistic drawing in favor of designing things that he wanted to physically construct. A topic that he especially explored in his art was the concept of the ephemeral and the non-object, art that only exists with interaction, which prompted him to create installation pieces or situational art. This led to his Virtual Spaces project, which he began in 1968. This project was \"based on Euclidian principles of space\" and sought to show how objects in space can be defined by three different planes. He modeled this concept as a series of environments made to look like corners in rooms.\nFollowing the military coup in 1964, Meireles became involved in political art. When Meireles was \"first getting started as an artist,\" governmental censorship of various forms of media, including art, was standard in Brazil. Meireles found ways to create art that was subversive but subtle enough to make public by taking inspiration from Dadaist art, which he notes had the ability to seem \"tame\" and \"ironic.\"  In the early 1970s he developed a political art project that aimed to reach a wide audience while avoiding censorship called Insertions Into Ideological Circuits, which was continued until 1976. Many of his installation pieces since this time have taken on political themes, though now his art is \"less overtly political.\"\nHe was one of the founders of the Experimental Unit of the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro in 1969 and in 1975, edited the art magazine Malasartes.\nIn 1999, Meireles was honoured with a Prince Claus Award and in 2008 he won the Velazquez Plastic Arts Award, presented by the Ministry of Culture of Spain.\n\n\n== Key works ==\n\n\n=== Red Shift (1967-84) ===\nA large-scale, three-room exploration of an entirely red environment. The title of the installation refers both to the scientific concept of chromatic shift (or chromatic aberration) as well as to the idea of a \"shift\" as a displacement or deviation.\nThe first room, called Impregnation, is approximately 50 m2 and filled with a number of everyday, domestic objects in a variety of different shades of red. The effect is an overwhelming visual saturation of the color. Upon entering the room, the participant experiences an initial shock from the visual inundation of red. Dan Cameron writes that \"one's gaze is literally thwarted in an effort to gain a purchase on the specificity of things.\" Because of its lack of chromatic differentiation, the environment appears to lack depth. Cameron argues that the longer a participant stays in the room the more aware they become of the color's negative, unsettling psychological impact on them.\nThe second room is called Spill/Environment and consists solely of a large pool of red ink spilled from a small bottle on the floor, evoking mental associations with blood. The amount of liquid on the floor in comparison to the amount which the bottle could conceivably hold is disproportionate. The redness on the floor extends throughout the small room to the edge of the darkened third room, an effect which lends itself to feelings of foreboding and uncertainty.\nThe third room, Shift, contains a washbasin attached to the wall at a 30\u00b0 angle illuminated by a direct beam of overhead light. A red stream pours into the washbasin from a tap, also at a 30\u00b0 angle, allowing the liquid to pool in the sink before draining. The feelings of disturbance experienced by the participant throughout the installation culminate in this final room. Since the room is completely dark, the sole focus is placed on the washbasin. While the connotations of blood which appear throughout the installation are at first rather vague, like in the initial saturation of red in the first room and in the ink spill of the second room, in the third room this association with blood becomes much more explicit, creating a final, visceral reaction to the color within the participant.\nArt historian Anne Dezeuze has commented that the \"cinematic\" installation as a whole articulates a certain sense of menace within participants because of the intense repetition of the color red throughout the three rooms. Like most of Meireles' other artworks, Red Shift takes on political undertones when examined in light of Brazil's military dictatorship which lasted throughout the creation and exhibition of this piece. For instance, the red liquid pouring into the washbasin has been seen by some art historians as a visual representation of the blood of victims murdered by government authorities.\n\n\n=== Southern Cross (1969-70) ===\nA minimalist sculpture, on a Lilliputian scale: Meireles calls it an example of \u201chumiliminimalism\u201d \u2013 a humble brand of minimalism. He wanted it to be even smaller, \u201cbut when [he] sanded it down to [his] nails, [he] lost patience and stopped at nine millimeters.\" Unlike most minimalist sculptures it is no mere object, but it is meant to be as richly symbolic, sensuous and potent as an amulet.  Each half of the tiny 9mm by 9mm by 9mm cube is made of pine and oak. These two types of wood are considered sacred by the Tupi people of Brazil. The title refers to an unofficial geographical (and metaphysical) region that lies to the west of Tordesillas. According to Meireles in a statement he made about the artwork in 1970, this region is \"the wild side, the jungle in one's head, without the lustre of intelligence or reason...our origins.\" It is a place where \"there are only individual truths.\" In the same statement, he notes that he wants Southern Cross to be perceived as a physical representation of the memory of the Tupi (\"people whose history is legends and fables\") and a warning to modernity of the growing self-confidence of the primordial which will eventually result in an overtaking of the urban by the natural. Meireles' statement is also political. It is a caution against indifference, especially against indifference towards Brazil's fading indigenous population. The tiny cube is meant to be placed alone in the middle of an empty room in order to emphasize the reality and the power of indigenous belief systems in the context of Eurocentric modernism.\n\n\n=== Insertions Into Ideological Circuits (1970-76) ===\nAn art project with political undertones that was designed to reach a mass-audience. This project manifested in multiple ways, two of the most well-known being the Coca-Cola project, and the Banknote project. Insertions Into Ideological Circuits was based upon three principles as defined by Meireles: 1) In society there are certain mechanisms for circulation (circuits); 2) these circuits clearly embody the ideology of the producer, but at the same time they are passive when they receive insertions into the circuit; 3) and this occurs whenever people initiate them. The goal of Insertions... was to literally insert some kind of counter-information or critical thought into a large system of circulated information. Meireles inserted something that is physically the same, though ideologically different, into a pre-existing system in order to counteract the original circuit without disrupting it. The project was achieved by printing images and messages onto various items that were already widely circulated and which had value discouraging them being destroyed, such as Coca-Cola bottles (which were recycled by way of a deposit scheme) and banknotes. Meireles screen-printed texts onto the Coca-Cola bottles that were supposed to encourage the buyer to become aware of their personal role in a consumerist society. The project simultaneously conveyed anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist messages. Building off of that concept, Meireles also used money as a theme and produced his own replica banknotes and coins (1974\u20131978) which appeared very similar to genuine Brazilian and US currency but with zero denominations clearly written on them, e.g. Zero Dollar. Mieireles also wrote critiques of the Brazilian government on the banknotes, such as \"Who killed Herzog?\" (in reference to journalist Vladimir Herzog), \"Yankees go home!\" and \"Direct elections.\"\n\n\n=== Through (1983-89) ===\nA labyrinthine structure which invites the visitor to walk across eight tons of broken plate glass. The maze is composed of \"velvet museum ropes, street barriers, garden fences, blinds, railings, and aquariums\" and in the center of it is a three-meter ball of cellophane. Meireles notes that an essential part of Through is the sense of psychological unease that comes from the participant's realization of the different sensory capacities and capabilities between the eyes and the body. For instance, the eyes can see through the glass parts of the work, but the body is physically impeded from passing through parts of the space. Furthermore, the sound of crunching glass underfoot while navigating the maze can be off-putting. He wanted the participant to experience psychological tension between the appreciation of the sonic and the appreciation of the visual. The work, Meireles says, \"is based on the notion of an excess of obstacles and prohibitions.\" Meireles drew some of his inspiration for this installation from writer Jorge Luis Borges, whose subject matter sometimes included the concept of the labyrinth.  Meireles also wanted the participant to experience feelings of awareness and attentiveness that come from walking a labyrinth.\n\n\n=== Babel (2001) ===\nA tower of hundreds of radios, each just audible and tuned to stations of different languages to evoke resonances of the Tower of Babel in the Bible. In the story, before the destruction of the Tower of Babel by God, every person on Earth spoke the same language. Meireles' Babel acknowledges the multiplicity of language that resulted from the Tower's destruction in the story. The artwork contradicts the notion of one universal language, emphasizing that the pursuit of commonality is futile. Paul Herkenhoff points out that Babel also has autobiographical meaning for Meireles, as radio was a common method of widespread communication in Brazil during the artist's youth. The work also speaks to globalization. Meireles parallels the unity of humanity before the fall of the Tower of Babel with the present-day unity which has resulted from globalization despite numerous language barriers.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nMeireles considers his first exhibition to have taken place in 1965, when one of his canvases and two of his drawings were accepted by the Segundo Sal\u00e3o Nacional de Arte Moderna in Brasilia.\nA retrospective of his work was presented at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York in 1999. It then traveled to the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro and the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Modern Art. In conjunction with the exhibition, a book entitled Cildo Meireles, was published by Phaidon Press (1999).\nThe first extensive presentation of the artist's work in the UK opened at Tate Modern in October 2008. Meireles was the first Brazilian artist to be given a full retrospective by Tate. This exhibition then moved to the Museu d'Art Contemporani in Barcelona, and later to the Museo Universitario Arte Contempor\u00e1neo (MUAC) in Mexico City until January 10, 2010.\nFrom March to July 2014 a major retrospective of Meireles's work was presented at Milan's HangarBicocca. It featured twelve of his most important works. Another important retrospective took place at SESC Pompeia from September 2019 to February 2020. In the exhibition entitled \"Entrevendo\" (Glimpsing) many of his most noteworthy installations were on display and an important catalogue was created for the exhibition.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\nBasualdo, Carlos. \"Maxima Moralia: The Work of C.

He studied art at the University of North Carolina from 1944 to 1946 under a wartime navy training program, and graduated from the University of Missouri in 1947. In the fall of 1947, Youngerman moved to Paris on a G.I. Scholarship; he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he studied with Jean Souverbie. He traveled to the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Greece, to visit art museums and historic sites. In 1948, he formed a lifelong friendship with Ellsworth Kelly and also met Eduardo Paolozzi and C\u00e9sar, each fellow students at Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1950, Youngerman had his first group exhibition, Les Mains eblouies at Galerie Maeght in Paris, which also included Pierre Alechinsky, Eduardo Chillida and Corneille. He visited the studios of Constantin Brancusi and Jean Arp with Kelly, and found himself influenced by their sense of organic form. He met Alexander Calder through his father-in-law, Henri Seyrig, a renowned archaeologist and cultural attache to the Free French delegation to the United States. During this time he became interested in the resurgence of geometric abstraction in Paris, especially in exhibitions such as Salon des R\u00e9alit\u00e9s Nouvelles which included Max Bill, Auguste Herbin and Richard Lohse. Youngerman also visited the Salon de Mai to see the most current work of the School of Paris artists, among them such masters as Henri Matisse. Youngerman's exposure to the contemporary art in post-war France was critical to his development; he introduced aspects of geometric abstraction and Constructivism into his painting.\nIn 1951 he mounted his first one-person exhibition at Galerie Arnaud in Paris. During this time he met the French artist, Francois Morellet, with whom he developed a life-long friendship. A few years later he travelled to visit Henri Seyrig in Beirut, then Director of Institut Francais d'Archeologie. In 1954 Youngerman was commissioned by the architect Michel Ecochard to create a color design for the College Protestant Fran\u00e7ais in Beirut.\nIn 1956 he designed sets for the French actor and director, Jean-Louis Barrault's production of Georges Schehaed's Histoire de Vasco. The American art dealer Betty Parsons visited Youngerman's Paris studio that summer, where she encouraged him to move to New York City.\nIn December 1956, he returned to the U.S. with his wife, Delphine Seyrig, and son; they rented a space in lower Manhattan's Coenties Slip, an area of largely abandoned loft buildings that would become a legendary artists' colony. There his friends and neighbors included Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, and Robert Rauschenberg.\nYoungerman's first one-person show at Betty Parsons Gallery marked his 1958 New York City debut. His development was unique among his peers, with elemental forms and fluid contours that marked his canvasses through the 1950s with imagery often emanating from a central core. Early in his growth the forms were organic; sometimes botanical in nature. He worked in thick black pigment as if it resided within the color spectrum.\nHis career continued its ascent with exhibitions at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. In 1959, Youngerman was featured alongside Johns, Frank Stella, and Kelly in Sixteen Americans, a landmark exhibition curated by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art. Between 1961 and 1968, Youngerman exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Galerie Lawrence in Paris, Galleria dell'Arte in Milan, Everett Ellin Gallery in Los Angeles, the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, and The Phillips Collection in Washington, DC. In 1968, he established a studio in Bridgehampton, New York, settling there full-time in 1995. In 1976, Youngerman received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. \nIn 2019, Youngerman premiered a body of work titled \"Cut-Ups\" at Washburn Gallery in New York City. His final exhibition, Jack Youngerman, \"Works on Paper,\" 1954 - 2019, took place at The Drawing Room in East Hampton, NY.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nJack Youngerman was the recipient of numerous awards from organizations including the National Council of Arts and Sciences, United States / Japan Exchange Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, National Academy of Design, the American Academy in Rome, Guild Hall Museum Lifetime Achievement Award, the Barnett and Annalee Newman Foundation, and the Lee Krasner Award/Pollock-Krasner Foundation.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1950, Youngerman married the French actress Delphine Seyrig (1932\u20131990).\nYoungerman died of complications from a fall in Stony Brook, New York on February 19, 2020, at the age of 93. He is survived by wife, Hilary Helfant, son Duncan (and partner Sunniva), and grandchildren Selina, Dylan, Marlon, and Errol.\nFrank Stella said of his friend Youngerman, \"I miss Jack and I miss the enthusiasm and touch that made his paintings so striking. It was as though beauty was imprinted into the canvas of our time.\" February 20, 2020\n\n\n=== Public collections ===\nYoungerman's art is represented in public and private collections across the globe, including:\n\nBoca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, FL\nCarnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA\nColumbus Museum of Art, Columbus, OH\nDenver Art Museum, Denver, CO\nEdith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, Portland, OR\nFrederick R.

Her earlier work included pop sculptures and monochromatic representational paintings. Based in New York City, she has been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions since 1965, and major retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVija Celmi\u0146a was born on October 25, 1938, in Riga, Latvia. Upon the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, during World War II, her parents fled with her and her older sister Inta to Germany, then under the Nazi regime; after the end of the war, the family lived in a United Nations supported Latvian refugee camp in Esslingen am Neckar, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1948, the Church World Service relocated the family to the United States, briefly in New York City, then in Indianapolis, Indiana. Sponsored by a local Lutheran church, her father found work as a carpenter, and her mother in a hospital laundry. Vija was ten, and spoke no English, which caused her to focus on drawing, leading her teachers to encourage further creativity and painting.\nIn 1955, she entered the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, where she has said that for the first time in her life, she did not feel like an outsider. In 1961 she won a Fellowship to attend a Summer session at Yale University, where she met Chuck Close and Brice Marden, who would remain close friends. It was during this time she began to study Italian monotone still life painter Giorgio Morandi, and painted abstract works. In 1962 she graduated from Herron with a BFA, and moved to Venice, Los Angeles, to pursue an MFA at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating in 1965. At UCLA, she enjoyed freedom, being far from her parents, leading to further artistic exploration. In 1978, she was an artist-in-residence, funded by the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA), at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art. She lived in Venice until 1980, painting and sculpting, and working as an instructor at the California State University, Los Angeles, the University of California, Irvine and California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia.\nIn 1981, following an invitation to teach at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, she moved permanently to New York City, wanting to be closer to the artists and art that she liked. She also returned to painting, which she had abandoned for twelve years, working during that time mainly in pencil. She later used woodcuts, and eraser and charcoal. Since that time, she has worked out of a cottage in Sag Harbor, New York, and a studio loft on Crosby Street in Soho, Manhattan. During the 1980s, she also taught at the Cooper Union and the Yale University School of Art.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nWorking in California in the 1960s, Vija Celmins' early work, generally in photorealistic painting and pop-inspired sculpture, was representational. She recreated commonplace objects such as TVs, lamps, pencils, erasers and the painted monochrome reproductions of photographs.  A common underlying theme in the paintings was violence or conflict, such as war planes, handguns and riot imagery. A retrospective of the 1964\u20131966 work was organized by the Menil Collection in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2010. She has cited Malcolm Morley and Jasper Johns as influences in this period.\nIn the late 1960s through the 1970s, she abandoned painting, and focused on working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or Moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, a master of the pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It is as if any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.\nAt the end of this period, from 1976 to 1983, Celmins also returned to sculpture in a way that incorporated her interest in photorealism. She produced a series of bronze cast, acrylic painted stones, exact replicas of individual stones she found along the Rio Grande in Northern New Mexico, with eleven examples held at MoMA. By 1981, she returned to painting, from this point forward working also with woodcuts and printing, and substantially in charcoal with a wide variety of erasers - often exploring negative space, selectively removing darkness from images, and achieving subtle control of grey tones.\nFrom the early 1980s forward, Celmins focused on the constellations, moon and oceans using these various techniques, a balance between the abstract and photorealism. By 2000, she had begun to produce haunting and distinctive spider webs, again negative images in oil or charcoal, to much critical acclaim, with particular note of her meticulous surface development and luminosity. She has said that all these works are based on photographs, and she imparts substantial effort on the built-up surfaces of the images.  In a 1996 review of her 30-year retrospective at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, The Independent cited her as \"American art's best-kept secret.\"\nCritics have often noted that Celmins' works since the late 1960s - the moon scapes, ocean surfaces, star fields, shells, and spider webs, often share the characteristic of not having a reference point: no horizon, depth of field, edge or landmarks to put them into context. The location, constellation, or scientific name are all unknown - there is no information imparted.\n\nFrom 2008, Celmins returned to objects and representative work, with paintings of maps and books, as well as many uses of small graphite tablets - hand held black boards. She also produced series prints of her now well-known waves, spiderwebs, shells and desert floors, many of which were exhibited at the McKee Gallery in June 2010.  She recently released a new series of prints that includes both night sky and waves mezzotints. These prints were exhibited at the Matthew Marks Gallery in January, February, and March 2018 and the Senior & Shopmaker Gallery in February and March 2018.\nHer woodcuts of water can take a year to cut; she has commented that they \"remind us of 'the complexity of the simplest things'\".\n\n\n== Solo exhibitions ==\nCelmins's works have been the subject of over forty solo exhibitions around the world since 1966 (Los Angeles), hundreds of group exhibitions. After her longtime dealer, McKee Gallery in New York, announced its closing in 2015, Celmins is currently represented by Matthew Marks Gallery.\nIn 2020, the major career survey Vija Celmins, was organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York and exhibited at the institution's former space MET Brauer. Between 1992 and 1994, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, organized the artist's mid-career retrospective. The show traveled to the Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Group exhibitions ==\nIn 2022, the Hammer Museum at University of California, Los Angeles, organized the exhibition Joan Didion: What She Means, curated by The New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als. The show traveled to the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami in 2023, and works by Vija Celmins were included alongside artworks by 50 other contemporary artists such as F\u00e9lix Gonz\u00e1lez-Torres, Ana Mendieta, Betye Saar, Maren Hassinger, Silke Otto-Knapp, John Koch, Ed Ruscha, Pat Steir, among others.\n\n\n== Notable works in public collections ==\n\nIn 2005, a major collector of her work, real estate developer Edward R. Broida, donated 17 pieces, covering 40 years of her career, to the Museum of Modern Art, as part of an overall contribution valued at $50 million ($50,000,000). Especially noteworthy were the early and late paintings.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n1961: Fellowship to Yale University Summer Session\n1968: Cassandra Foundation Award\n1971 & 1976: Artist's Fellowship from National Endowment for the Arts\n1980: Guggenheim Fellowship\n1996: American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Art\n1997: Skowhegan Medal for Painting\n1997: John D. and Catherine T.

He is associated with olfactory art, visual poetry, performance art and the mail art movement.\nHis work covers different areas, including administration (which he calls Artministration), postal and olfactory communication.\n\n\n== Art and archive ==\nGuy Bleus was born in Hasselt, Belgium. In 1978 he founded The Administration Centre \u2013 42.292 which became a huge art archive with the works and information of 6000 artists from more than 60 countries. \"Guy Bleus has one of the finest archives of mail art in Europe, if not the world.\"\nBleus was the first artist who systematically used scents in plastic arts. In 1978 he wrote the olfactory manifesto The Thrill of Working with Odours in which he deplores the lack of interest in scents in the visual arts. Since then he showed smell paintings, mailed perfumed objects and made aromatic installations; he also created spray performances where he sprayed a mist of fragrance over the audience.\nExploring the possibilities of communication media as art media, he investigated the postal system in Indirect correspondence (1979) and searched for an alternative postal system in Airmail by balloons. Together with Charles Fran\u00e7ois he was a pioneer using a computer connected to a modem for artistic communication (in 1989). He also applied reproduction media such as Microfilm, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM for artistic reasons.\n\n\n== Performance works ==\nOne of his performance works from the 1980s was documented in the artists' periodical Force Mental. The performance took place in the venue Il Ventuno in Hasselt, and is described as follows: \n\"Guy Bleus wears a costume made of official stamps of 1/2fr. He cuts his moustache into a Hitler-moustache. Against the wall he hangs photocopies of Hitler's head. Enlargements whereby the moustache is growing bigger (till A3 format). Bleus sticks then stamps, the same as of which his costume is made of and stamps them with his number-stamp: 42.292. Then he sticks a naked girl full with stamps of 1/2fr and stamps them with the number stamp. Finally he cuts off his Hitler-moustache and breaks a mirror.\"\nAnother fascinating performance of Bleus is called 'Value Shredder' (1982, Brussels, Gallery Entr'Act). Bleus took hundreds of real 50 Belgian franc banknotes and made a suit out of them. Wearing this suit he began his performance. He gave the audience plastic raincoats to put on and asked them to hand over their identity cards. He put the cards into a paper shredder, then tore up Mein Kampf and threw the pages into the shredder too. When everything was completely shredded he blew odours and flour over the public with a fan. Finally, he removed his suit and set it on fire. After the performance the public received an identity card from planet Mars. A life-size photo of Bleus's money suit is part of the art collection of the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).\nTo honor the Italian artist Guglielmo Achille Cavellini Guy Bleus organized the four-day \"Cavellini Festival 1984\" in the cities of Antwerp, Brussels, Eeklo, Hasselt, and Tienen. In the administrative performance \"First President of the USE\" in Brussels, capital of Europe, Bleus officially declared Cavellini the very first president of the United States of Europe.\n\n\n== Networking and projects ==\nNumerous are the international art projects Bleus has organised, such as Are you experienced? L.H.F.S. (1981), W.A.A.: Mail eARTh Atlas (1981\u201383), Telegraphy (1983), Aerograms (1984), Cavellini Festival 1984, Art is Books (1991), Fax Performances (1992\u20131993), Private Art Detective: Sealed Confessions, and Building Plans & Schemes (1993).\nHe wrote and published many essays on the subject of networking art. About his essay Exploring Mail Art (1984), G\u00e9za Perneckzy wrote: \u201cThe study of Guy Bleus outranks all other publications with its theoretical weight and conciseness.\u201d Moreover, he contributed to significant publications, such as Piotr Rypson\u2019s Mail Art, Chuck Welch's Eternal Network, A Mail Art Anthology, or Vittore Baroni\u2019s Postcards \u2013 Cartoline d\u2019artista. He participated in many artists' periodicals.\nFrom 1994 till 1999 he opened in Hasselt the art gallery E-Mail-Art Archives. In this non-profit space more than 40 events of mail art, fax art and Internet art took place. Artists such as Ben Vautier, Shozo Shimamoto, Anna Banana, Julien Blaine, H.R. Fricker and Clemente Padin were exhibited.\nIn 1995 he edited The Artistamp Collection, the first mail art catalogue on CD-ROM. With the participation of networking artists such as Vittore Baroni, Ken Friedman, John Held Jr., Ruud Janssen, Gy\u00f6rgy Gal\u00e1ntai, Pawel Petasz and G\u00e9za Perneczky, he published in 1997 the first E-Mail-Art & Internet-Art Manifesto, an issue of his electronic zine.\nAfter a bureaucratic venture of 20 years he realised in 2003 (together with Jean Spiroux) the very first postage stamp on the theme mail art edited by an official Postal Service. It was an edition of 4 million copies realised by the Belgian Postal Service.\nIn 2005\u20132006 Bleus organised the olfactory mail art project Scents, Locks & Kisses with 778 artists from 43 countries in the Art Museum Z33. The website is a slideshow with all the works of the participating artists.\nA retrospective of his work was held in the Cultural Centre of Hasselt in 2010.

Byrne represented Ireland at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007.\nCharacterized by laconic humor, Byrne's projects examine the ambiguity of language and what is achieved or lost in translation from text to image.\nByrne is precise in his research and analysis of the relationship between time, documentation, and recognizable visual language, and while each of his various work teams is conceived independently, they resonate together as if created in relation to a specific but repairable historical referent.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDemos, TJ. \"\u201cOpenings: Gerard Byrne.\u201d Artforum (Summer 2007), pp. 478\u2013480.\nHansen, Rikke. \"Gerard Byrne.\" Art Monthly, (May 7, No. 306)\nPierce, Sarah and Claire Coombes, eds.

He studied art at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, and later continued to study at the University of Utah until 1969. He went on to study at the San Francisco Art Institute, receiving a BFA in painting. In 1972 he studied film, video, and art at the University of Southern California, receiving an MFA. From 1982 to 2002 he taught performance, video, installation, and performance art history at the University of California, Los Angeles. McCarthy currently works mainly in video and sculpture.\nOriginally formally trained as a painter, McCarthy's main interest lies in everyday activities and the mess created by them. Much of his work in the late 1960s, such as Mountain Bowling (1969) and Hold an Apple in Your Armpit (1970), are similar to the work of Happenings founder Allan Kaprow, with whom McCarthy had a professional relationship.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nMcCarthy's works include performance, sculpture, installation, film and \"painting as action\". His points of reference are rooted, on the one hand, in things typically American, such as Disneyland, B-Movies, Soap Operas and Comics \u2013 he is a critical analyst of the mass media and consumer-driven American society and its hypocrisy, double standards and repression. On the other hand, it is European avant-garde art that has had the most influence on his artistic form language. Such influences include the Lost Art Movement, Joseph Beuys, Sigmund Freud, Samuel Beckett, and the Viennese Actionism.\n\nI started making videotapes in the early 1970s. The first ones were around perception and illusion. The camera was upside down, or I\u2019d use mirrors, things like that. But I also started making pieces that were performances in the sense that I would be in front of the camera. I would work in the studio primarily by myself with the camera. There was not much in the room. I would do some things and record them. They were often repetitious and intuitive. Ma Bell was one of the first actions that I did which involved liquids, in this case, motor oil. I had not planned to make the piece. It was spontaneous. It was the first tape where there was a persona. \n\nAlthough by his own statement the happenings of the Viennese Actionists were known to him in the 1970s, he sees a clear difference between the actions of the Viennese and his own performances:\n\nVienna is not Los Angeles. My work came out of kids' television in Los Angeles. I didn't go through Catholicism and World War II as a teenager, I didn't live in a European environment. People make references to Viennese art without really questioning the fact that there is a big difference between ketchup and blood. I never thought of my work as shamanistic. My work is more about being a clown than a shaman.\nIn his early works, McCarthy sought to break the limitations of painting by using the body as a paintbrush or even canvas; later, he incorporated bodily fluids or food as substitutes into his works. In a 1974 video, Sauce, he painted with his head and face, \"smearing his body with paint and then with ketchup, mayonnaise or raw meat and, in one case, feces.\" This clearly resembled the work of Vienna actionist G\u00fcnter Brus. Similarly, his work evolved from painting to transgressive performance art, psychosexual events intended to fly in the face of social convention, testing the emotional limits of both artist and viewer. An example of this is his 1976 piece Class Fool, where McCarthy threw himself around a ketchup-spattered classroom at the University of California, San Diego until dazed and self-injured. He then vomited several times and inserted a Barbie doll into his rectum. The piece ended when the audience could no longer stand to watch his performance. Concerned that the University's custodians would have to clean up the mess, graduate students Virginia Maksymowicz and Blaise Tobia, along with art historian Moira Roth, spent several hours cleaning up the ketchup and vomit. Maksymowicz can be seen in the rear left of a documentary photo of the event.\nMcCarthy's work in the 1990s, such as Painter (1995), often seeks to undermine the idea of \"the myth of artistic greatness\" and attacks the perception of the heroic male artist.\nMcCarthy's transfixion with Johanna Spyri's novel Heidi led to his 1992 video and installation Heidi: Midlife Crisis Trauma Center and Negative Media-Engram Abreaction Release Zone, on which he collaborated with Mike Kelley.\nCaribbean Pirates (2001\u201305), alludes to the Johnny Depp film franchise and to the Disneyland attraction.\n\n\n=== Complex Shit ===\nDuring the summer of 2008, Paul McCarthy's inflatable Complex Shit, installed on the grounds of the Paul Klee Centre in Bern, Switzerland, took off in a wind, bringing down a power line, breaking a greenhouse window and a window at a children's home. This incident was widely reported internationally via news outlets in several languages with headlines like \"Huge turd catastrophe for museum\" and \"Up in the sky: is it a turd or a plane?\"\n\n\n=== Santa Claus ===\nMcCarthy has created several Christmas-themed works. Through them, he combined his impressions of the dismal aesthetic and the real meaning of Christmas.\nIn 2001, he created Santa Claus for the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Originally, it was intended to be placed next to the concert hall at the locally famous \"Schouwburgplein\" square, but it never was. This was due to controversies around the statue: The work is seen by many citizens as having sexual connotations, and, therefore it also is colloquially called \"Butt plug Gnome\". Its original location was rejected by citizens and retailers, as well as several other proposed locations. On November 28, 2008, it did, however, receive a permanent destination on the Eendrachtsplein square, within a walkway-of-statues project.\n\n\n=== White Snow ===\nIn November 2009, an exhibition called \"White Snow\" was held at Hauser & Wirth New York, featuring McCarthy's mixed-media works, centered on the character Snow White from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\n\n=== Tree ===\nIn October 2014, McCarthy unveiled Tree in Place Vend\u00f4me in Paris. The inflatable sculpture, standing 24 meters tall, was said to resemble a large green butt plug. This caused controversy among citizens, who believed their historic square had been sullied. Within two days the piece had been deflated by someone, and McCarthy stated that he did not want it to be repaired or replaced. He also admitted to Le Monde that its butt plug shape was deliberate, and a \"joke\". In 2016 he again exhibited Tree at Paramount Ranch 3, amongst the trees and rolling hills of the Santa Monica Mountains, where the reception was positive and visitors \"reveled in its absurdist glory\".\nTomato Head\nIn 1994, McCarthy had one of his most important works from the 1990s, Tomato Head. McCarthy created a life size comic figure. Exploring the relationship between modern culture, innocence, consumerism. In a way this piece pays homage to the iconic children\u2019s toy Mr. Potato Head. McCarthy\u2019s human figure has an enlarged cartoonish red tomato as its head, transforming a child's toy into a sinister work of art.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRugoff, Ralph, Kristine Stiles, Massimiliano Gioni, Robert Storr.

He represented with Vik Muniz their country in 2001 Venice Biennale, his installations were featured in Brazil's national pavilion and in the international group exhibition at the Arsenale.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nNeto's work has been described as \"beyond abstract minimalism\". His installations are large, soft, biomorphic sculptures that fill an exhibition space that viewers can touch, poke, and walk on or through. They are made of white, stretchy material\u2014amorphous forms stuffed with Styrofoam pellets or, on occasion, aromatic spices. In some installations, he has also used this material to create translucent scrims that transform the space's walls and floor. His sculptures can be regarded as expression of traditional abstract form, but in their interaction with the viewer, they work on another level as well.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIn 2009 Neto exhibited a new work at New York's Park Avenue Armory called anthropodino. Filling the 55,000-square-foot (5,100 m2) hall, the aim is to help the Armory reposition itself as a big-art destination like the Turbine Hall in London's Tate Modern.\nIn 1998, Neto exhibited a new installation Navedenga. A clear-like lycra chamber that stretched from the floor and ceiling, viewers were invited to remove their shoes and walk through it. Resembling penetrating an opening, this installation tries to connect the dependence of the viewer's experience and the work itself.\nNeto has been awarded chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\nIn 2018, Neto exhibited at a central train station in Zurich, Switzerland. The exhibition was titled GaiaMotherTree and consisted largely of hand-knotted cotton strips in oranges and yellows. The exhibit was created alongside the Beyeler Foundation and featured a monthlong series of workshops for both children and adults which took place beneath the exhibit. At the time of its debut, Beyeler Foundation director Sam Keller estimated that approximately a half-million people will visit the station and, consequently, the sculpture. This would have made GaiaMotherTree the most visited work of art in the history of Switzerland.\nIn 2019, Neto exhibited at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery with Children of the Earth in Los Angeles, California. This solo exhibit consisted of yellows, greens, purples, and reds. The exhibit also utilized musical instruments, spices and crystals to engage all five senses.\nIn 2021, Neto exhibited a new work at The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston called SunForceOceanLife. This solo exhibit featured large, spiraling hand-woven materials in oranges, yellows and greens.\n\n\n== References ==\nSoares, Valeska; Meireles, Cildo; Neto, Ernesto.
