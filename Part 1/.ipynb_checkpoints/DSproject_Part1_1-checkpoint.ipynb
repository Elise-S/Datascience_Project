Her research interests ranged from algebraic geometry to functional analysis and tensor analysis; she was a speaker at the 1928 International Congress of Mathematicians.\\nShe is also remembered for her struggles against discrimination against women in the Italian university hiring system. A street in Rome is named after her.\\n\\n\\n== Life and academic career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nNalli was born on February 10, 1886, in Palermo, to a middle-class family with seven children. She studied at the University of Palermo, where she obtained a laurea in 1910 under the supervision of Giuseppe Bagnera, with a thesis concerning algebraic geometry, and in the same year joined the Circolo Matematico di Palermo.\\nAfter finishing her studies, Nalli assisted Bagnera in Palermo in 1911 and then began working as a school teacher. She completed a habilitation thesis in 1914 on the theory of integrals, and continued to work on Fourier analysis and Dirichlet series for the next several years.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic career ===\\nNalli served as assistant to Giuseppe Bagnera at the University of Palermo from 1 April 1911 to 16 November 1911. She then taught at a number of secondary schools, first in the girls' school at Avellino, then in Trapani, and from 16 November 1912 in the girls' technical school in Palermo. During this time Nalli continued her research, completing her thesis \\\"Esposizione e confronto critico delle diverse definizioni proposte per l'integrale definito di una funzione limitata o no\\\", a study of the theory of the integral based on recent work on the subject by \\u00c9mile Borel, Henri Lebesgue Charles de la Vall\\u00e9e Poussin, Giuseppe Vitali and Arnaud Denjoy.\\nIn 1921, Nalli became extraordinary professor at the University of Cagliari. She had been ranked second to Mauro Picone in the competition for the position, possibly in part because she was female, but Picone chose to stay at the University of Catania and become head of mathematics there, so the Cagliari position fell to Nalli. In 1923, she was listed first in a search for a position at the University of Pavia, but not offered the position. Finally, after similar mistreatment from several other universities, she moved to the University of Catania as a full professor in 1927. At around this time, perhaps encouraged by Tullio Levi-Civita, she switched her research focus from functional analysis to tensor calculus.\\nShe was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1928.\\n\\n\\n=== Death and legacy ===\\nNalli died on 27 September 1964, in Catania. A street in Rome, the Via Pia Nalli, is named after her.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\nPia Nalli published 61 mathematical works, including the monograph (Nalli 1914) and a textbook. Her \\\"Selected works\\\" (Nalli 1976) include this monograph plus eleven articles on topics mainly belonging to functional and mathematical analysis: the following list includes also her doctoral thesis (Nalli 1911) and other works on tensor calculus\\n\\nNalli, Pia (1911), \\\"Riduzione di un fascio di curve piane di genere uno, corrispondente a s\\u00e9 stesso in una trasformazione birazionale involutoria del piano\\\" [Reduction of a bundle of genus one planar curves, corresponding to itself in a birational involutive transformation of the plane], Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo (in Italian), 31 (1): 92\\u2013108, doi:10.1007/BF03018796, JFM 42.0604.02, S2CID 122170638.\\nNalli, Pia (1914), Esposizione e confronto critico delle diverse definizioni proposte per l'integrale definito di una funzione limitata o no [Exposition and critical comparison of the different definitions proposed for the definite integral of a bounded or not function] (in Italian), Palermo: Stabilimento tipografico Virz\\u00ec, p. 163, JFM 45.1282.01.\\nNalli, Pia (1922), \\\"Sulle operazioni funzionali lineari\\\" [On linear functional operations], Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo (in Italian), 46 (1): 49\\u201390, doi:10.1007/BF03018259, JFM 48.1247.01, S2CID 121029135.\\nNalli, Pia (1928), \\\"Sulla metrica superficiale di una variet\\u00e0\\\" [On the surface metric of a manifold], Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo (in Italian), 52 (1): 260\\u2013264, doi:10.1007/BF03016619, JFM 54.0769.01, S2CID 122204340.\\nNalli, Pia (1937), \\\"Trasporti rigidi di vettori nelle variet\\u00e0 metriche\\\" [Rigid transport of vectors in metric manifolds], Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo (in Italian), 61 (2): 314\\u2013338, doi:10.1007/BF03014120, JFM 65.0796.06, S2CID 121908768, Zbl 0020.26002.\\nNalli, Pia (1976), Fichera, Gaetano; Guglielmino, Francesco (eds.), Opere scelte [Selected works], Opere dei Grandi Matematici Italiani (in Italian), Milano: Litografia D.

She was the valedictorian of Perquimans High School's first graduating class in 1926 and is an alumna of the North Carolina College for Women where she graduated in 1930 with a B.A. in mathematics and a minor in education.\\nTucker spent the next four years as a high school mathematics teacher in her hometown. In 1935, she was recruited to work at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (now Langley Research Center), the main research center for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, at the time. Tucker was one of five women from around the country recruited to be part of Langley's first \\\"computer pool\\\". As human computers, these women were responsible for processing the large amounts of data gathered from flight, wind tunnel, and aeronautical tests conducted at the facility, as the NACA did not have electrical computers at the time.\\n\\nAs World War II began in 1939, the rapid development of aeronautical technologies became a main priority of the U.S. Military and as a result, the demand for human computers at Langley grew rapidly.

His work has been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums and is held in public collections. He was one of the founders of the land art movement whose best known work is the Spiral Jetty (1970).\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nSmithson was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and spent his childhood in Rutherford until he was nine. In Rutherford, the poet and physician William Carlos Williams was Smithson's pediatrician. When Smithson was nine, his family moved to the Allwood section of Clifton. He studied painting and drawing in New York City at the Art Students League of New York from 1954 to 1956 and then briefly at the Brooklyn Museum Art School.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early work ===\\nHe primarily identified as a painter during this time, and his early exhibited artworks had a wide range of influences, including science fiction, Catholic art and Pop art. He produced drawings and collage works that incorporated images from natural history, science fiction films, classical art, religious iconography, and pornography including \\\"homoerotic clippings from beefcake magazines\\\". Paintings from 1959 to 1962 explored \\\"mythical religious archetypes\\\" and were also based on Dante's Divine Comedy such as the paintings from 1959 Wall of Dis and The Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise, that correspond to the Divine Comedy's three-part structure.\\nAfter a break from the art world, Smithson reemerged in 1964 as a proponent of the minimalist movement. His new work abandoned the preoccupation with the body that had been common in his earlier work, and he began to use glass sheet and neon lighting tubes to explore visual refraction and mirroring. His wall-mounted sculpture Enantiomorphic Chambers was made of steel and mirrors and created the optical effect of a \\\"pointless vanishing-point\\\". Crystalline structures and the concept of entropy became of interest to him and informed a number of sculptures completed during this period, including Alogon 2, (1966) composed of ten units, the title of which refers to the Greek word for an unnamable, irrational number. Smithson's interest in entropy led him to write about a future in which \\\"the universe will burn out into an all-encompassing sameness\\\". His ideas on entropy also addressed culture, \\\"the urban sprawl and the infinite number of housing developments of the post war boom have contributed to the architect of entropy\\\". He called these urban/suburban sprawls \\\"slurbs.\\\" Smithson viewed entropy as a form of transformation of society and culture, which is shown in his artwork, for example, the non-site pieces. Smithson became affiliated with artists who were identified with the minimalist or Primary Structures movement, such as Nancy Holt (whom he married), Robert Morris and Sol LeWitt.\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\n\\n\\n==== Non-sites ====\\nIn 1967 Smithson began exploring industrial areas around New Jersey and was fascinated by the sight of dump trucks excavating tons of earth and rock that he described in an essay as the equivalents of the monuments of antiquity. This resulted in the series of 'non-sites' in which earth and rocks collected from a specific area are installed in the gallery as sculptures, often combined with mirrors or glass. Works from this period include Eight-Part Piece (Cayuga Salt Mine Project) (1969) and Map of Broken Clear Glass (Atlantis) (1969). In September 1968, Smithson published the essay \\\"A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects\\\" in Artforum that promoted the work of the first wave of land art artists, and in 1969 he began producing land art pieces to further explore concepts gained from his readings of William S. Burroughs, J. G. Ballard, and George Kubler. The journeys he undertook were central to his practice as an artist, and his non-site sculptures often included maps and aerial photos of a particular location, as well as the geological artifacts displaced from those sites. Of these travels, several on-site works were produced including Mirror Displacements a series of photographs that illustrated his essay \\\"Incidents of Mirror Travels in the Yucatan\\\" (1969).\\n\\n\\n==== Writings ====\\nSmithson produced theoretical and critical writing in addition to visual art. In addition to essays his  writings included visual-text formats such as the 2D paper work A Heap of Language, which sought to show how writing might become an artwork. In his essay Incidents of Mirror-Travel in the Yucatan Smithson documents a series of temporary sculptures made with mirrors at particular locations around the Yucatan peninsula. Part travelogue, part critical rumination, the article highlights Smithson's concern with the temporal as a cornerstone of his work.\\nOther theoretical writings explore the relationship of a piece of art to its environment, from which he developed his concept of sites and non-sites. A site was a work located in a specific outdoor location, while a non-site was a work which could be displayed in any suitable space, such as an art gallery. Spiral Jetty is an example of a sited work, while Smithson's non-site pieces frequently consist of photographs of a particular location, often exhibited alongside some material (such as stones or soil) removed from that location.\\nAs a writer, Smithson was interested in applying the Dialectical method and mathematical impersonality to art that he outlined in essays and reviews for Arts Magazine and Artforum and for a period was better known as a critic than as an artist. Some of Smithson's later writings recovered 18th- and 19th-century conceptions of landscape architecture which influenced the pivotal earthwork explorations which characterized his later work. He eventually joined the Dwan Gallery, whose owner Virginia Dwan was an enthusiastic supporter of his work. In the late 1960s Smithson's work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication which experimented with language and meaning-making.\\n\\n\\n==== Frederick Law Olmsted's influence ====\\nSmithson's interest in the temporal is explored in his writings in part through the recovery of the ideas of the picturesque. His essay Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape was written in 1973 after Smithson had seen an exhibition curated by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers at the Whitney Museum entitled Frederick Law Olmsted's New York as the cultural and temporal context for the creation of his late-19th-century design for Central Park. In examining the photographs of the land set aside to become Central Park, Smithson saw the barren landscape that had been degraded by humans before Olmsted constructed the complex 'naturalistic' landscape that was viscerally apparent to New Yorkers in the 1970s. Smithson was interested in challenging the prevalent conception of Central Park as an outdated 19th-century picturesque aesthetic in landscape architecture that had a static relationship within the continuously evolving urban fabric of New York City. In studying the writings of 18th- and 19th-century picturesque treatise writers Gilpin, Price, Knight and Whately, Smithson recovers issues of site specificity and human intervention as dialectic landscape layers, experiential multiplicity, and the value of deformations manifest in the picturesque landscape. Smithson further implies in this essay that what distinguishes the picturesque is that it is based on real land. For Smithson, a park exists as \\\"a process of ongoing relationships existing in a physical region\\\". Smithson was interested in Central Park as a landscape which by the 1970s had weathered and grown as Olmsted's creation, and was layered with new evidence of human intervention.\\n\\nNow the Ramble has grown up into an urban jungle, and lurking in its thickets are \\\"hoods, hobos, hustlers, and homosexuals,\\\" and other estranged creatures of the city .... Walking east, I passed graffiti on boulders ... On the base of the Obelisk along with the hieroglyphs there are also graffiti. ... In the spillway that pours out of the Wollman Memorial Ice Rink, I noticed a metal grocery cart and a trash basket half-submerged in the water. Further down, the spillway becomes a brook choked with mud and tin cans. The mud then spews under the Gapstow Bridge to become a muddy slough that inundates a good part of The Pond, leaving the rest of The Pond aswirl with oil slicks, sludge, and Dixie cups.\\nIn revisiting the 18th- and early 19th-century treatises of the picturesque, which Olmsted interpreted in his practice, Smithson exposes threads of an anti-aesthetic anti-formalist logic and a theoretical framework of the picturesque that addressed the dialectic between the physical landscape and its temporal context. By re-interpreting and re-valuing these treatises, Smithson was able to broaden the temporal and intellectual context for his own work, and to offer renewed meaning for Central Park as an important work of modern art and landscape architecture.\\n\\n\\n==== Industrial ruins and disrupted landscapes ====\\nWhile Smithson did not find \\\"beauty\\\" in the evidence of abuse and neglect, he did see the state of things as demonstrative of the continually transforming relationships between humans and landscape. He claimed, \\\"the best sites for 'earth art' are sites that have been disrupted by industry, reckless urbanization, or nature's own devastation.\\\" Smithson became particularly interested in the notion of industrial decay within the spectrum of anti-aesthetic dynamic relationships which he saw present in the picturesque landscape.  In his proposal to make process art out of the dredging of The Pond in Central Park, Smithson sought to insert himself into the dynamic evolution of the park. While in earlier 18th-century formal characterizations of the pastoral and the sublime, something like a \\\"gash in the ground\\\" or pile of rocks, if encountered by a \\\"leveling improver\\\", as described by Price, would have been smoothed over and the area terraformed into a more aesthetically pleasing contour. For Smithson, it was not necessary that the disruption become a visual aspect of a landscape; by his anti-formalist logic, more important was the temporal scar worked over by natural or human intervention. He saw parallels to Olmsted's Central Park as a \\\"sylvan\\\" green overlay on the depleted landscape that preceded his Central Park  Defending himself against allegations that he and other earth artists \\\"cut and gouge the land like Army engineers\\\", Smithson, in his own essay, charges that one of such opinions \\\"failed to recognize the possibility of a direct organic manipulation of the land..\\\" and would \\\"turn his back on the contradictions that inhabit our landscapes\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Significant works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Spiral Jetty ===\\n\\nSpiral Jetty (1970) is an earthwork in the form of a 1,500-foot-long (460 m), 15-foot-wide (4.6 m) counterclockwise spiral of local basalt rocks and mud, forming a jetty that juts from the shore of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point in Utah. Over the years it has accumulated a patina of salt crystals when the level of the lake is low. Some art historians consider the Spiral Jetty to be the most important work by Smithson. He documented the construction of the sculpture in a 32-minute color film also titled Spiral Jetty. Smithson wrote that he deliberately chose the site due to its proximity to a derelict oil jetty. In later years oil and gas extraction has threatened the area.\\n\\n\\n=== Partially Buried Woodshed ===\\n\\nPartially Buried Woodshed (1970) is an earthwork created at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio. The work consisted of a derelict woodshed on campus that he covered with earth until the central beam broke, illustrating the concept of entropy. By 2018, only a mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. An informational plaque is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the Liquid Crystal Institute building on the Kent State University main campus.\\n\\n\\n=== Broken Circle/Spiral Hill ===\\n\\nIn 1971 Smithson created Broken Circle/Spiral Hill in Emmen, the Netherlands as part of the Sonsbeek art festival. The subject of the 1971 Sonsbeek exhibition was Beyond Lawn and Order (Dutch: Buiten de perken). The Broken Circle earthwork was built in a quarry lake 10-to-15 feet deep. It was 140 feet in diameter, with the canal 12 feet wide, and built of white and yellow sand. The accompanying Spiral Hill is made of earth, black topsoil, and white sand, and is 75 feet in diameter at its base. The work is still being maintained and occasionally opened for visitors.\\n\\n\\n== Unrealized projects ==\\n\\nDuring his lifetime, Smithson created several proposals for projects that were unrealized, either due to their visionary nature, lack of support or their impracticality. Between 1966 and 1967 he produced Proposals for the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport as concepts for \\\"aerial art\\\", monumental-scaled earthworks to be seen by air travelers. In 1970 Smithson created a series of drawings for Floating Island: To Travel around Manhattan Island. The proposed project consisted of a barge containing broken concrete or glass to be pulled by a tugboat around Manhattan. Other versions of the project were of a barge filled with earth and planted with trees and other vegetation. In 1971 he drew Towards the Development of a \\\"Cinema Cavern\\\", a design for a theater to be built inside a cave with spelunkers as the intended audience. In 1973 he designed the Bingham Canyon Reclamation Project, a visionary proposal for the three-mile-wide (4.8 km) copper pit mine in Utah owned by the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The mining company responded negatively to the proposal and it was never built.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nThe work of Robert Smithson is held in numerous public collections around the world including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, the Tate Modern, London, the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among others.\\n\\n\\n== Death and legacy ==\\n\\nOn July 20, 1973, Smithson, a photographer and the pilot died in a light aircraft crash while inspecting the site of Amarillo Ramp on the ranch of Stanley Marsh 3 near Amarillo, Texas, in a Beechcraft Baron E55; the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the accident to the pilot's failure to maintain airspeed, with distraction being a contributing factor. The work was subsequently completed by Smithson's widow Nancy Holt, Richard Serra and Tony Shafrazi. It was originally built to rise from a shallow artificial lake, but the lake later dried up, and the earthwork has become overgrown and eroded.\\nSmithson has a following among many contemporary artists. Artists Tacita Dean, Sam Durant, Ren\\u00e9e Green, Lee Ranaldo, Vik Muniz, Mike Nelson, and the Bruce High Quality Foundation have all made homages to Smithson's works.\\nIn 2017 the Holt/Smithson Foundation was founded to preserve, through public service, the investigative spirit of the two artists who \\\"developed innovative methods of exploring our relationship with the planet, and expanded the limits of artistic practice.\\\" The goal of the foundation is to \\\"increase awareness of both artists' creative legacies\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nBusch, Julia M.

In the mid-1970s, Prince made drawings and painterly collages that he has since disowned. His image, Untitled (Cowboy), a photographic reproduction of a photograph by Sam Abell and appropriated from a cigarette advertisement, was the first rephotograph to be sold for more than $1 million at auction at Christie's New York in 2005. He is regarded as \\\"one of the most revered artists of his generation\\\" according to The New York Times. \\nStarting in 1977, Prince photographed four photographs which previously appeared in The New York Times. This process of rephotographing continued into 1983, when his work Spiritual America featured Garry Gross's photo of Brooke Shields at the age of ten, standing in a bathtub, as an allusion to precocious sexuality and to the Alfred Stieglitz photograph by the same name.  His Jokes series (beginning 1986) concerns the sexual fantasies and sexual frustrations of white, middle-class America, using stand-up comedy and burlesque humor.\\nAfter living in New York City for 25 years, Prince moved to upstate New York. His mini-museum, Second House, purchased by the Guggenheim Museum, was struck by lightning and burned down shortly after the museum purchased the House (which Prince had created for himself), having only stood for six years, from 2001 to 2007. In June 2021, the painting Runaway Nurse from 2005 to 2006 fetched a record-breaking 93,986,000 HKD (US$12,121,000) at Sotheby's in Hong Kong. Prince now lives and works in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nRichard Prince was born on the 6th of August 1949, in the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone, now part of the Republic of Panama. During an interview in 2000 with Julie L. Belcove, he responded to the question of why his parents were in the Zone, by saying \\\"they worked for the government.\\\" When asked further if his father was involved in the military, Prince responded, \\\"No, he just worked for the government.\\\" The Wall Street Journal later reported that Prince's parents worked for the Office of Strategic Services in the Panama Canal before he was born. Prince later lived in the New England city of Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and Provincetown on Cape Cod. In 1973, he moved to New York and joined publishing company Time Inc. His job at the Time Inc. library involved providing the company's various magazines with tear sheets of articles.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nPrince was first interested in the art of the American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. \\\"I was very attracted to the idea of someone who was by themselves, fairly antisocial, kind of a loner, someone who was noncollaborative.\\\" Prince grew up during the height of Pollock's career, making his work accessible. The 1956 Time magazine article dubbing Pollock \\\"Jack the Dripper\\\" made the thought of pursuing art as career possible. After finishing high school in 1967, Prince set off for Europe at age 18.\\nHe returned home and attended Nasson College in Maine, which he described as without grades or structure. From Maine he moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, and for a brief time lived in Provincetown. Ultimately he was drawn to New York City. Prince has said that his attraction to New York was instigated by the famous photograph of Franz Kline gazing out the window of his 14th Street studio. Prince described the picture as \\\"a man content to be alone, pursuing the outside world from the sanctum of his studio.\\\"\\nPrince's first solo exhibition took place in June 1980 during a residency at the CEPA gallery in Buffalo, New York. His short book Menthol Wars was published as part of the residency. In 1981 Prince had his first West Coast solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1985, he spent four months making art in a rented house in Venice, Los Angeles.\\nIn late 2007, Prince had a retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, a comprehensive show hung in chronological order along the upward spiraling walls. The show continued onto the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Maria Morris Hamburg, the curator of photography at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, asserted, \\\"He is absolutely essential to what's going on today, he figured out before anyone else\\u2014and in a very precocious manner\\u2014how thoroughly pervasive the media is. It's not just an aspect of our lives, but the dominant aspect of our lives.\\\"\\nPrince has built up a large collection of Beat books and papers. Prince owns several copies of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, including one inscribed to Kerouac's mother, one famously read on The Steve Allen Show, the original proof copy of the book and an original galley, as well as the copy owned by Neal Cassady (the Dean Moriarty character in the book), with Cassady's signature and marginal notes.\\nDescribing his career and methodology in a 2005 New York magazine interview, Prince said, \\\"It's about knocking about in the studio and bumping into things.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Rephotography ===\\nRe-photography uses appropriation as its own focus: artists pull from the works of others and the worlds they depict to create their own work. Appropriation art became popular in the late 1970s. Other appropriation artists such as, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Vikky Alexander, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger and Mike Bidlo also became prominent in the East Village in the 1980s. This grouping of artists became known as the \\\"Pictures Generation.\\\" All of these artists were greatly influenced by the work of John Baldessari and Robert Heinecken, both of whom have worked extensively with found or readymade print photography since the 1960s, Baldessari working mainly with Hollywood film stills and Heineken mainly with magazine advertisements and print pornography. Both artists taught at UCLA and the California Institute for the Arts in Southern California throughout the 1970s, when many of these artists attended school there.\\nDuring the early period of his career, Prince worked in Time magazine's tear sheets department. At the end of each work day, he would be left with nothing but the torn out advertising images from the eight or so magazines owned by Time-Life. On the topic of found photographs, Prince said, \\\"Oceans without surfers, cowboys without Marlboros\\u2026Even though I\\u2019m aware of the classicism of the images. I seem to go after images that I don\\u2019t quite believe. And, I try to re-present them even more unbelievably.\\\"\\n\\nPrince had very little experience with photography, but he has said in interviews that all he needed was a subject, the medium would follow, whether it be paint and brush or camera and film. He compared his new method of searching out interesting advertisements to \\\"beachcombing.\\\" His first series during this time focused on models, living room furniture, watches, pens, and jewellery.  Pop culture became the focus of his work. Prince described his experience of appropriation thus: \\\"At first it was pretty reckless. Plagiarizing someone else\\u2019s photograph, making a new picture effortlessly. Making the exposure, looking through the lens and clicking, felt like an unwelling . . . a whole new history without the old one. It absolutely destroyed any associations I had experienced with putting things together. And of course the whole thing about the naturalness of the film\\u2019s ability to appropriate. I always thought it had a lot to do with having a chip on your shoulder.\\\"\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Patrick Cariou copyright infringement suit ===\\n\\nIn December 2008, photographer Patrick Cariou filed suit against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Lawrence Gagosian and Rizzoli International Publications in Federal district court for copyright infringement in work shown at Prince's Canal Zone exhibit at the Gagosian gallery. Prince was charged with wrongfully appropriating 35 photographs made by Cariou. Several of the pieces were barely changed by Prince.  Prince also made 28 paintings that included images from Cariou's Yes Rasta book. The book featured a series of photographs of Rastafarians that Cariou had taken in Jamaica.\\nOn March 18, 2011, US District Judge Deborah A. Batts ruled against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Inc., and Lawrence Gagosian.  The court found that the use by Prince was not fair use (his primary defence), and Cariou's issue of liability for copyright infringement was granted in its entirety.  The court cited much case law including the Rogers v. Koons case of 1992. On April 25, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Batts's ruling, stating that Prince's use of the photographs in 25 works was transformative and thus fair use. Five less transformative works were sent back to the lower court for review. The case was settled in 2014.\\n\\n\\n=== Appropriation of Emily Ratajkowski's Image ===\\nIn 2014, Prince appropriated one of Emily Ratajkowski's Instagram posts without her consent and included the image in his \\\"New Portraits\\\" exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in New York. Seven years later, Ratajkowski took a photograph of herself standing in front of the painting, and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it. The NFT sold at auction at Christie's for $175,000. \\\"I hope to symbolically set a precedent for women and ownership online, one that allows for women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution,\\\" Ratajkowski wrote on Twitter. Ratajkowski describes the event in the popular essay for The Cut, titled \\\"Buying Myself Back\\\". The controversy raises questions about personality rights and who gets to benefit from the use of one's image.\\n\\n\\n=== Eric McNatt and Donald Graham infringement suits ===\\nIn 2016, photographer Donald Graham sued Prince for violating the copyright on his 1998 photograph, Rastafarian Smoking a Joint by including the photograph in his \\\"New Portraits\\\" series. In May of 2023, a New York judge ruled that Prince's artwork Untitled (Portrait of Rastajay92) was not \\\"transformative\\\" enough to shield Prince from litigation, and that Graham's copyright infringement case can proceed to trial. Photographer Eric McNatt similarly sued Prince in 2016 for infringing on his copyright to his portrait of Kim Gordon, co-founder of the band Sonic Youth. On January 26 2024, the two linked cases were settled, with damages awarded to Graham and McNatt, but without any admission of infringement by Prince. [1]\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cowboys ===\\nPrince's series known as the Untitled Cowboys, produced from 1980 to 1992, and ongoing, is his most famous group of rephotographs. Taken from Marlboro cigarette advertisements of the Marlboro Man, they represent an idealized figure of American masculinity. The Marlboro Man was the iconic equivalent of later brands like Ralph Lauren, which used the polo pony image to identify and associate its brand. \\\"Every week. I'd see one and be like, Oh that's mine, Thank you,\\\" Prince stated in an interview.\\nPrince's Cowboys displayed men in boots and ten-gallon hats, with horses, lassos, spurs and all the fixings that make up the stereotypical image of a cowboy. They were set in the Western U.S., in arid landscapes with stone outcrops flanked by cacti and tumbleweeds, with backdrops of sunsets. The advertisements were staged with the utmost attention to detail.\\nPrince's rephotographs of the Marlboro Man advertisements attempt to question how original and realistic the commercial depiction of a \\\"macho man on the horse\\\" is. Prince described his process in a 2003 interview by Steve Lafreiniere in Artforum: \\\"I had limited technical skills regarding the camera. Actually I had no skills. I played the camera. I used a cheap commercial lab to blow up the pictures. I made editions of two. I never went into a darkroom.\\\"\\nWhile Prince re-contextualizes images by others to redefine them, he has also failed to acknowledge those preceding photographers whose work he appropriates. For the Untitled (Cowboy) Series, this includes Norm Clasen and a handful of others. Clasen has expressed being aggrieved over the failure to attribute his work saying: \\\"If you see somebody's copied your work, there's something deep down in you that says \\\"I'm the author of that.\\\"'\\nUntitled (Cowboy) has since been credited by Time Magazine as one of the \\\"Top 100 most influential images of all time.\\\"\\n\\n\\n=== Jokes, Gangs, and Hoods ===\\nPrince's rephotographs led to his series known as the Gangs, which followed the same technique of appropriating images from magazines as the Cowboys did, but now the subjects moved from advertisements and mass media toward niches in American society.\\nPrince in this series paid homage to \\\"sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll\\\" in American niches, seen through magazines. He depicted the bizarre in subcultures such as the motorcycle-obsessed, hot rod enthusiasts, surfers, and heavy metal music fans. These Gangs are recognized in his series Girlfriends, featuring biker girls. A motorcycle magazine he used featured photographs of motorcyclists' girlfriends, were sprawled on their boyfriends' bikes. Prince's Gangs works are single sheets of white paper covered with a grouping or \\\"ganging\\\" of 9\\u00d712, 35 mm photographs. Prince did not intend any distinct relationship between the \\\"ganged\\\" photographs. An example can be seen in such works as his 1984 Velvet Beach, twelve Ektacolor-printed photographs of massive waves, clearly from a surf magazine. Another example is his 1986 Live Free or Die, gathering nine images of loosely dressed women on motorcycles.\\nPrince's made his first Joke painting circa 1985, in New York, when he was living in the back room of 303 Gallery located on Park Avenue South. The first joke represented was about psychiatrists, a subject he later worked with often. Prince described the discovery of the idea for the Joke Paintings beginning when he posted a small 11 \\u00d7 14 inch handwritten joke on paper. He realized that if he had walked into a gallery and had seen it hanging from the wall, he would have been envious. Prince's Jokes come in several forms. His first Jokes were hand written, taken from joke books. His jokes grew into more substantial works as he began to incorporate them with images, often pairing jokes with images that had no relevance with one another, creating an obscure relationship. An example of one of these peculiar combinations can be seen in his 1991 Good Revolution, which depicted black and white images of a male torso in boxing shorts set amongst doodles of a kitchen stove. These were set above the text \\\"Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman that will give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong home, that's what it means.\\\" Another one of Prince's most well-known Joke paintings is an 80s-style red canvas painting he did in 2004 that says, \\\"Two psychiatrists, one says to the other: I was having lunch with my mother the other day and I made a Freudian slip. I meant to say, 'Please pass the butter,' and instead it came out, 'You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.'\\\"\\nIn the late 1980s, Prince, like his contemporaries Lorna Simpson and Barbara Kruger, as well as many of his Conceptual Art precursors, played with image and text in a strategy that was becoming increasingly popular. Prince put jokes among cartoons, often from The New Yorker. Prince described his early discovery of jokes and his sense of humor, as \\\"I never really started telling, I started telling them over. Back in 1985, in Venice, California, I was drawing my favorite cartoons in pencil on paper. After this I dropped the illustration or image part of the cartoon and concentrated on the punch line.\\\" Prince's jokes were primarily satirical one-liners, poking fun at topics such as religion, the relationship between husband and wife, his relations with women. The jokes are simple, often relying on a punch line: \\\"I took my wife to a wife-swapping party, I had to throw in some cash\\\" or \\\"I never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name.\\\"\\nJokes became the complete subject of his prints, set atop monochromatic backgrounds red, orange, blue, yellow, etc. These works range in size from 56 \\u00d7 48 inches as seen in his 1994 Untitled, to 112 \\u00d7 203.5 inches, as seen in his 2000 work Nuts. His early jokes were modestly sized, but as they caught on he executed larger pieces. These Monochromatic Jokes question the importance of the unique, in high art. What is it that set these jokes apart from one another, the background color, the color of the text, the jokes themselves? Compared to other Appropriation Artists working in the same time period, Prince has a distinct quality between works and series. Works are distinguishable from one another or identifiable as a particular artist, but with Prince's Monochromatic Jokes, we are presented with yellow text upon a blue background as in his 1989 Are You Kidding? Differing from Jeff Koons, for example, are not only technique and style, but also the significance given to making the artwork identifiable. In 1988 Koons was working with porcelain sculptures like his Michael Jackson and Bubbles and Pink Panther. These are two works produced in this year that are distinguishable. In the same year, 1988, are Prince's Fireman and the Drunk and his Untitled (Joke), which raise the serious question of what sets these two works apart. In a 2000 interview with Julie L. Belcove, Prince called the joke paintings \\\"what I wanted to become known for.\\\" When asked to identify the artistic genre of his Jokes, Prince responded, \\\"the Joke paintings are abstract. Especially in Europe, if you can't speak English.\\\"\\nWhile developing his Gang photographs and Joke paintings Prince was also making sculptural facsimiles of muscle car hoods that merged muscle car culture as a particularly American state of mind. Prince ordered classic vehicle car hoods from within custom car restoration networks and then used the hoods to cast Fiberglas molds which he washed in different colors.\\n\\n\\n=== Celebrities ===\\nCelebrities is a series that plays with the American obsession with movie stars. Following Warhol's lead, Prince would search out actors' headshots, promotional photographs which frequently lack copyright protection. Prince signed them himself, using the actor's name.\\n\\n\\n=== Check Paintings ===\\nThe Check Paintings series is like the Celebrities. It was made possible by Prince's own interest in collecting. Prince began to seek out canceled checks from famous figures in history ranging from Jack Kerouac to Andy Warhol. He put these checks onto paint-covered canvases and often paired them with images of the individual they once belonged to.\\n\\n\\n=== Nurse Paintings ===\\nThe Nurse Paintings are a series inspired by the covers and titles of inexpensive novels that were commonly sold at newspaper stands and delis (pulp romance novels). Prince scanned the covers of the books on his computer and used inkjet printing to transfer the images to canvas, and then personalized the pieces with acrylic paint. They debuted in 2003 at Barbara Gladstone Galleries, who along with Larry Gagosian, represents Prince. They received mixed responses, not all selling at the asking prices of $50,000 to $60,000. Titles include Surfer Nurse, Naughty Nurse, Millionaire Nurse, and Dude Ranch Nurse, the books from which they were copied. Prince said, \\\"The problem with art is, it's not like the game of golf, where you put the ball in the hole or you don't put the ball in the hole. There's no umpire. There's no judge. There are no rules. It's one of the problems, but it's also one of the great things about art: it becomes a question of what lasts.\\\" The Sonic Youth album Sonic Nurse used Nurse paintings, and included a song called \\\"Dude Ranch Nurse\\\". \\nIn the series of paintings, the nurses all wear caps and their mouths are covered by surgical masks, although in some of the paintings the red lips bleed through the masks. The final presentations preserve the title and nurse image from each of the book covers, though almost all else is obscured. Titles include A Nurse Involved, Aloha Nurse, Bachelor Nurse, Danger Nurse at Work, Debutant Nurse, and Doctor's Nurse.\\nPrince's Nurse paintings have become by far his most expensive series, accounting for his 17 biggest results at auction as of September 2021.\\n\\n\\n=== Later works ===\\nPrince's series of paintings from 2007 on appear to be a throwback to more traditional genres of figurative art, and a departure from the pulpy and kitschy content of the Nurse and Jokes series. They are pornographic ink-jet prints overlaid with acrylic paint in a style trying to imitate Willem de Kooning. Prince makes the most direct treatment to the faces, hands and feet, which are bulged and distorted. These works lack the obvious linguistic re-contextualizing of the Jokes series, opting instead for a purely visual idiom.\\nIn 2007, Prince collaborated with the fashion designer Marc Jacobs on his Spring 2008 collection for the French label Louis Vuitton.\\nAn untitled work consists of the body of a 1970 Dodge Challenger and high-performance parts such as a 660 hp Hemi engine, custom interior, black wheel wells, 14-inch tires in the front and 16 inch in the back, a pale orange paint job with a flat black T/A hood, as well as various decals and emblems. Another car sculpture, called American Prayer, is a 1968 Dodge Charger that has been completely emptied of any engine parts and interiors and is stripped of any paint and then powder coated. In place of the engine block there is a cement block.\\nIn Untitled (Covering Pollock), a series of 27 works made between 2009 and 2011, Prince printed black-and-white photos of Jackson Pollock taken by Hans Namuth on canvas and pasted grids of photographs showing Sid Vicious, Kate Moss, Stephanie Seymour and pornographic imagery on top. Prince adds his own Pollock-style gestures in paint around the grids.\\nIn 2014, Prince continued his appropriation theme with an exhibit of 38 portraits at the Gagosian gallery in New York City, entitled \\\"New Portraits.\\\" Each image was taken from his Instagram feed and included topless images of models, artists, and celebrities. Underneath the images, Prince provided comments like, \\\"Don't du anything. Just B Urself \\u00a9 \\u00ae\\\", with the copyright and registered trademark symbols likely being references to his interests in authorship. \\\"Possible cogent responses to the show include naughty delight and sheer abhorrence\\\", wrote art critic Peter Schjeldahl in The New Yorker. \\\"My own was something like a wish to be dead.\\\" As with previous appropriated Prince works, the Instagram prints draw attention to the intersection of art and copyright infringement. Some of the unwilling subjects of his art, notably members of SuicideGirls, have started selling their own derivative works based on Prince derivative works of their original works.\\nIn 2015, Prince would repeat his exhibit from Gagosian with a new exhibit for the Frieze Art Fair in NYC. However, Prince would end up making headlines due to selling the portraits for profit\\u2014at the fair, Prince sold enlargements of his Instagram feed and comments for $90,000.\\nIn 2017, he generated controversy by returning a $36,000 payment he had received in 2014 for his portrayal of Ivanka Trump, claiming that he could not live with the idea of one of his works being in the collection of the Trump family.\\n\\n\\n== Museum exhibitions ==\\nPrince has been the subject of major survey exhibitions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1992); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1993); Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam (1993); Museum f\\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst, Basel (2001, traveled to Kunsthalle Z\\u00fcrich and Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg); Solomon R.

       "  'Hilda Phoebe Hudson (11 June 1881  Cambridge – 26 November 1965 London) was an English mathematician who worked on algebraic geometry, in particular on Cremona transformations. Hudson was interested in the link between mathematics and her religious beliefs.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nIn 1900 Hudson gained a scholarship and entered Newnham College at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1903, coming 7th equal among the First Class students. After a year of further study at the University of Berlin, she returned to Newnham in 1905, first as lecturer in mathematics and later as Associate Research Fellow. Trinity College Dublin awarded her an ad eundam MA, and later a DSc, in 1906 and 1913, respectively.\\nShe was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1912 at Cambridge UK. Although Laura Pisati had been invited to the 1908 ICM, she died just before the start of the conference, so Hudson became the first female invited speaker at an ICM.\\nShe spent the academic year 1912–1913 at Bryn Mawr in the US, and the years 1913–1917 back in England, this time as lecturer at West Ham Technical Institute.   She joined an Air Ministry subdivision undertaking aeronautical engineering research in 1917, where she applied pioneering work on the application of mathematical modelling to aircraft design. She was appointed OBE in 1919. As a distinguished mathematician she was one of the few women of her time to serve on the council of the London Mathematical Society.\\nMost of Hudson\\'s pure mathematical research was concerned with surfaces and plane curves, her special interest being in Cremona transformations. Her 1916 monograph Ruler and Compasses was well-received as \"a welcome addition to the literature on the boundary between elementary and advanced mathematics\". Her 454-page 1927 treatise Cremona transformations in plane and space is considered by John Semple to be her magnum opus.\\nHudson was deeply religious, and a supporter of the Student Christian Movement. She sought, in her work, to understand the revelation of the glory of God in the beauty she found in mathematics. In later life, debilitated by arthritis, she moved into St Mary\\'s Convent and Nursing home, an Anglican convent, where she died on 26 November 1965.\\n\\n\\n== Epidemiology ==\\nHudson published work with Ronald Ross on epidemiology and the measurement of disease spread. \"The classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model, originated from the seminal papers of Ross and Ross and Hudson in 1916-1917 and the fundamental contributions of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927-1932, describes the transmission of infectious diseases between susceptible and infective individuals and provides the basic framework for almost all later epidemic models.\"\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nRuler and Compasses, first published as a monograph (Longman\\'s Modern Mathematical Series, 1916) and then included in the compendium Squaring the circle and other monographs (Chelsea n.d.)\\nCremona Transformations in Plane and Space, Cambridge University Press, 1927.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nO\\'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Hilda Phoebe Hudson\", MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, University of St Andrews\\nSemple, J.

After graduating from high school in 1936, she went to a local school, Harris Teachers College, despite being highly ambitious academically, because it was free; her parents were not especially supportive and could not afford a more expensive school. She majored in education there, with a minor in mathematics, and graduated in 1940.\\nAfter a year working as a schoolteacher, she went to Saint Louis University for graduate study in mathematics, choosing it as the best of the two universities local enough to allow her to continue living with her parents, and\\ndespite her mother\\'s dismissal of her academic ambitions. During this time she continued working as a schoolteacher to support herself, before obtaining a fellowship in the final year of her program, the first woman to do so. She earned a master\\'s degree in 1943 and completed her Ph.D. in 1947.\\nHer dissertation, Determination of All Classes of Positive Quaternary Quadratic Forms Which Represent All (Positive) Integers, was supervised by Arnold Ross,. A short summary of it was later published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, the main result of which being that \"there are exactly 178 classes of universal classic positive quaternary quadratic forms\".  This was later found to be incorrect.  Based on the use of the 15 theorem, Manjul Bhargava determined the correct number to be 204. As noted by John H. Conway, \"Willerding’s work had been unusually defective. [...] she missed 36 forms, listed 1 form twice, and listed 9 non-universal forms!\"\\nWhile she was still working on her doctorate, Ross moved to the University of Notre Dame to become department chair, and she commuted there by train to visit him. She became engaged to an older physicist at Notre Dame, Eugene Guth, but did not end up marrying him, and Ross\\'s plans to hire her at Notre Dame also did not work out.\\n\\n\\n== Career and later life ==\\nAfter completing her doctorate, Willerding became a mathematics instructor at Washington University in St. Louis, beginning in 1947. However, after being told that she would be passed over for promotions in favor of male faculty members, and being asked to pour tea for faculty wives at a mathematics meeting held at the university, she left after a single semester. Instead, she returned to Harris Teachers College and began focusing on mathematics education instead of mathematical research. During this time she also became active in the Missouri Section of the Mathematical Association of America.\\nIn 1954 she started her work as mathematical problems editor for School Science and Mathematics, a position she held until 1976 despite a colleague undercutting her in the early 1960s by suggesting to the journal\\'s editor-in-chief that she was too old for the position.\\nShe moved in 1956 to San Diego State University, and retired as a professor emeritus in 1976.

This theory is based on the duality of sites and Grothendieck toposes, and on the notion of classifying topos of a geometric first-order theory, exploiting the diversity of possible presentations of each topos by infinitely many sites or theories. Caramello\\'s theory involves several components : on the one hand, establishing equivalences between toposes presented in different ways; on the other hand, calculating or expressing topos invariants in terms of the various types of presentations considered, in order to produce correspondences between properties or elements of these various presentations.\\nThe theory of \"toposes as bridges\" can be considered a meta-mathematical theory of the relations between different theories and her program contributes to realizing the unifying potential of the notion of topos already glimpsed by Alexander Grothendieck.\\nCaramello organized international conferences in topos theory, \"Topos à l\\'IHES\" (2015). and \"Toposes in Como\" (2018) She is an editor of the journal Logica Universalis and is running a blog and forum about toposes.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and recognition ==\\nCaramello was awarded the AILA (Associazione Italiana di Logica e sue Applicazioni) Prize in 2011, a \"L\\'Oréal-Unesco Fellowship for Women in Science\" in 2014  and a \"Rita Levi Montalcini\" position of the Italian Ministry for Education, University and Research in 2017.\\nCaramello\\'s methodology of toposes as bridges has been qualified by André Joyal as a \"vast extension of Felix Klein\\'s Erlangen Programme\" and has been endorsed by Fields Medalists Alain Connes and Laurent Lafforgue.\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\nIn 2015 Caramello had a public controversy with a number of senior exponents of the category theory community, whom she accused of spreading negative ungrounded opinions on her work; her case is discussed in an academic paper.\\n\\n\\n== Selected publications ==\\nCaramello, Olivia (2014). \"Fraïssé\\'s construction from a topos-theoretic perspective\".

       "  'Dame Mary Lucy Cartwright  (17 December 1900 – 3 April 1998) was a British mathematician. She was one of the pioneers of what would later become known as chaos theory. Along with J. E. Littlewood, Cartwright saw many solutions to a problem which would later be seen as an example of the butterfly effect.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nMary Cartwright was born on 17 December 1900, in Aynho, Northamptonshire, where her father William Digby was vicar. Through her grandmother Jane Holbech, she descended from poet John Donne and William Mompesson, Vicar of Eyam. She had four siblings, two older and two younger: John (born 1896), Nigel (born 1898), Jane (born 1905), and William (born 1907). Her early education was at Leamington High School (1912–1915), and then at Gravely Manor School in Boscombe (1915–1916) before completion in Godolphin School in Salisbury (1916–1919).\\nCartwright studied mathematics at St Hugh\\'s College, Oxford, graduating in 1923 with a first class degree. She was the first woman to attain the final degree lectures and to obtain a first. She briefly taught at Alice Ottley School in Worcester and Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire before returning to Oxford in 1928 to read for her D.Phil. Cartwright was supervised by G. H. Hardy in her doctoral studies. During the academic year 1928–9 Hardy was at Princeton, so it was E. C. Titchmarsh who took over the duties as a supervisor. Her thesis \"The Zeros of Integral Functions of Special Types\" was examined by J. E. Littlewood, whom she met for the first time as an external examiner in her oral examination for that 1930 D.Phil.\\nIn 1930, Cartwright was awarded a Yarrow Research Fellowship and went to Girton College, Cambridge to continue working on the topic of her doctoral thesis. Attending Littlewood\\'s lectures, she solved one of the open problems which he posed. Her mathematical theorem, now known as Cartwright\\'s Theorem, gives an estimate for the maximum modulus of an analytic function that takes the same value no more than p times in the unit disc. To prove the theorem she used a new approach, applying a technique introduced by Lars Ahlfors for conformal mappings.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nThroughout her career, Cartwright wrote over ninety articles on several different mathematical concepts. Her contributions extended to topics such as the Dirichlet series, Abel summation, directions of Borel spreads, analytic functions regular on the unit disk, the zeros of integral functions, maximum and minimum moduli, and functions of finite order in an angle. \\n\\nIn 1936, Cartwright became director of studies in mathematics at Girton College. In 1938, she began work on a new project which had a major impact on the direction of her research. The Radio Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research produced a memorandum regarding certain differential equations which came out of modelling radio and radar work. They asked the London Mathematical Society if they could help find a mathematician who could work on these problems and she became interested. The dynamics lying behind the problems were unfamiliar to Cartwright, so she approached Littlewood for help with this aspect. They began to collaborate studying the equations, which greatly surprised the two:For something to do we went on and on at the thing with no earthly prospect of \"results\"; suddenly the whole vista of the dramatic fine structure of solutions stared us in the face.\\nThe fine structure described here is today seen to be a typical instance of the butterfly effect. The collaboration led to important results which have greatly influenced the direction that the modern theory of dynamical systems has taken. Although the duo did not supply the answer in time, they succeeded in directing the engineers\\' attention away from faulty equipment towards practical ways of compensating for the electrical \"noise\"—or erratic fluctuations—being produced.\\nIn 1945, Cartwright simplified Hermite\\'s elementary proof of the irrationality of π. She set her version of the proof as a Tripos question, later published in an appendix to Sir Harold Jeffreys\\' book Scientific Inference. In 1947, she was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society; although she was not the first woman to be elected to that Society, she was the first female mathematician.\\nCartwright was appointed Mistress of Girton in 1948 and a Reader in the Theory of Functions in Cambridge in 1959 until 1968. From 1957 to 1960, she was president of the Cambridge Association of University Women. After retiring from Girton, she was a visiting professor at Brown University from 1968 to 1969 and at Claremont Graduate School from 1969 to 1970.

       "  'Fotini G. Markopoulou-Kalamara (Greek: Φωτεινή Μαρκοπούλου-Καλαμαρά; born April 3, 1971) is a Greek theoretical physicist interested in quantum gravity, foundational mathematics, quantum mechanics and a design engineer working on embodied cognition technologies.  Markopoulou is co-founder and CEO of Empathic Technologies. She was a founding faculty member at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics and was an adjunct professor at the University of Waterloo.\\n\\n\\n== Quantum gravity ==\\nMarkopoulou received her PhD from Imperial College London in 1998 and held postdoctoral positions at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, Imperial College London, and Pennsylvania State University. She shared First Prize in the Young Researchers competition at the Ultimate Reality Symposium in Princeton, New Jersey.\\nShe has been influenced by researchers such as Christopher Isham who call attention to the unstated assumption in most modern physics that physical properties are most naturally calibrated by a real-number continuum. She, and others, attempt to make explicit some of the implicit mathematical assumptions underpinning modern theoretical physics and cosmology.\\nIn her interdisciplinary paper \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set: What the Universe Looks Like from the Inside\", Markopoulou instantiates some abstract terms from mathematical category theory to develop straightforward models of space-time. It proposes simple quantum models of space-time based on category-theoretic notions of a topos and its subobject classifier (which has a Heyting algebra structure, but not necessarily a Boolean algebra structure).\\nFor example, hard-to-picture category-theoretic \"presheaves\" from topos theory become easy-to-picture \"evolving (or varying) sets\" in her discussions of quantum spacetime. The diagrams in Markopoulou\\'s papers (including hand-drawn diagrams in one of the earlier versions of \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set\") are straightforward presentations of possible models of space-time. They are intended as meaningful and provocative, not just for specialists but also for newcomers.\\nIn May 2006, Markopoulou published a paper with Lee Smolin that further popularized this Causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) theory by explaining the time-slicing of the Ambjorn–Loll CDT model as a result of gauge fixing. Their approach relaxed the definition of the Ambjorn–Loll CDT model in 1 + 1 dimensions to allow for a varying lapse.\\n\\n\\n== Quantum graphity ==\\nIn 2008, Markopoulou, Tomasz Konopka, Mohammad H. Ansari, and Simone Severini initiated the study of a new background independent model of evolutionary space called quantum graphity.\\nIn the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be on or off. This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are on the links have additional state variables which are used to define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature the graph is in Phase I where all the points are randomly connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the temperature drops and the graph cools, it is conjectured to undergo a phase transition to Phase II where spacetime forms. It will then look like a spacetime manifold on large scales with only near-neighbor points being connected in the graph.\\nThe hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this geometrogenesis models the condensation of spacetime in the big bang. A second model, related to ideas around quantum graphity, has been published.\\nMarkopoulou is one of the quantum gravity researchers that uses the quantum computation framework to formulate new quantum theories of gravity. In her paper The Computing Spacetime she has given an easily accessible overview of these ideas.\\n\\n\\n== Innovation Design Engineering ==\\nAfter Perimeter\\'s director Neil Turok did not allow her to apply for tenure, Markopoulou left Perimeter in the fall of 2011.  In a move away from physics in 2012, Markopoulou enrolled and studied on the Innovation Design Engineering double masters (MA+MSc) at Imperial College London and the Royal College of Art, graduating in 2014. Her two graduation projects were a solo project: Cityzen, a digital voting system using values-based data analytics, and MyTempo, a group project with Nell Bennett, Andreas Bilicki and Jack Hooper. MyTempo won the Deutsche Bank Award for Creative Enterprise (Design Category) 2014 and was exhibited at the John Lewis Future Store.\\nIn 2014, Markopoulou received a double MSc from The Royal College of Art and Imperial College London in Innovation Design Engineering (IDE), an interdisciplinary course that focuses on the exploration and development of impactful innovation through critical observation, disruptive design thinking, experimentation, exploration of emergent technologies, advanced engineering and enterprise activities. Her Masters thesis was a digital voting system that makes the rich landscape of our voices tangible, reducing the distractions of democracy and the effort required by people and government to participate.\\nAfter graduating Markopoulou and her colleagues founded doppel, a company that researches psycho-physiology, the way in which a person\\'s mind and body affect one-another, to create technology that changes how people perceive, feel and behave. MyTempo was rebranded to become doppel and in June 2015 was launched on Kickstarter.\\n\\n\\n== Empathic Technologies ==\\nMarkopoulou is co-founder and CEO of Empathic Technologies,\\na tech company that uses research in psychophysiology to create technology that changes how the user perceives, feels and behaves. Empathic Technologies won the Best Female-Led Investment 2018 Award from the UK Business Angels Association.\\nThe company’s first product, doppel Archived 2021-08-03 at the Wayback Machine, is a wristband that reduces stress. Peer-reviewed trial results found that Doppel had a significant calming effect during a socially stressful situation.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nMarkopoulou lives in Oxford, England, with her husband Doyne Farmer and their son Maris.

       "  'Cécile Andrée Paule DeWitt-Morette (21 December 1922 – 8 May 2017) was a French mathematician and physicist. She founded the Les Houches School of Physics in the French Alps. For this and her publications, she was awarded the American Society of the French Legion of Honour 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement. Attendees at the summer school included over twenty students who would go on to be Nobel Prize winners, including Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Georges Charpak, and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, who identify the school for assisting in their success.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nCécile Morette was born in 1922 and brought up in Normandy, where in 1943 she earned her License des Science from the University of Caen.\\nDespite her original intention to become a surgeon, she completed her degree in mathematics, physics, and chemistry due to limited opportunities to attend medical school in France during World War II.\\nFollowing the completion of her bachelor\\'s degree, Morette entered the University of Paris. She was studying there when her mother, sister, and grandmother were killed in the Allied bombing of Caen to support the D-Day landings.  In 1944, while still working toward her doctorate at the University of Paris, Morette took a job at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, then under the direction of Frederic Joliot-Curie. She worked as a scholar at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies from 1946 to 1947. In 1947, she completed her Ph.D. (Sur la production des mésons dans les chocs entre nucléons).\\nIn 1948 she was invited to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey by Robert Oppenheimer, who had recently become director of the institute. While there, she became interested in Richard Feynman\\'s path integral method for computations in quantum mechanics and worked to make this approach rigorous, which ultimately led to wide applications of the Feynman diagrams and the underlying mathematics. She also met her future husband and scientific collaborator, American physicist Bryce DeWitt while at IAS; the couple married in 1951, and would have four children.\\nTo revitalize French research in mathematics and physics following the war, DeWitt-Morette established a summer school, Les Houches School of Physics, at Les Houches in the French Alps in 1951.  She told stories of how she obtained the funding by tricking her way into a minister\\'s office and then persuaded her male colleagues to support the idea by pretending that the idea was theirs.\\nMorette was to lead this school for the next 22 years. The school was able to list twenty former students or lecturers at the school who went on to become Nobel laureates. The French mathematician Alain Connes, who is a recipient of the Fields Medal, credited the summer school as responsible for his career in mathematics. Nobel laureates Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Georges Charpak, and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji identified the school as helping with their success. In 1958, NATO funded a series of advanced study centres that were based on Morette\\'s summer school. In 1987, Cecile DeWitt-Morette participated in a Quantum Gravity Seminar in Moscow together with her husband.\\nBryce DeWitt died in 2004 from cancer. In 2007, DeWitt-Morette was awarded the American Society of the French Legion of Honour 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement in New York. She was then the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor Emerita of Physics at the University of Texas at Austin.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nIn 1953 a trustee of the unusual Gravity Research Foundation, Agnew Bahnson, contacted Bryce DeWitt with a proposal to fund a gravity research institute. The proposed name was agreed as the \"Institute for Field Physics\" and it was established in 1956 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the direction of Bryce and Morette. \"She was an instructor in the department from 1956-1971 but was offered a position at the University of Texas at Austin after UNC failed to promote her despite her significant contributions to physics and the department. The DeWitts then left together with their students in January of 1972.\" \\nIn 1958 Cécile DeWitt-Morette invited Léon Motchane to see the Institute of Advanced Study in USA which inspired Léon Motchane to establish an institute dedicated to fundamental research in three areas: mathematics, theoretical physics, and the methodology of human sciences upon which he later created the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques.\\n\\n\\n=== Expedition to test general relativity ===\\nIn 1972 Morette and her husband led an expedition to Mauritania to confirm that light was deflected in line with the theory of general relativity, to improve on Arthur Eddington\\'s 1919 experiment. These measurements were made during the solar eclipse there. Comparison of the pictures with those made six months later confirmed that, in line with theory, light was indeed bent when passing by massive objects. Morette and her husband joined the faculty of the University of Texas in 1972. She began to work increasingly in physics rather than in mathematics, and she became a Professor in 1985.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nIn 2007 Professor Cécile DeWitt-Morette was awarded the American Society of the French Legion of Honour 2007 Medal for Distinguished Achievement in New York.

       "  'Anna Cartan (15 May 1878 – 1923) was a French mathematician, teacher and textbook author who was a student of Marie Curie and Jules Tannery.\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\nCartan was the youngest child born to Anne Florentine Cottaz (1841–1927) and Joseph Antoine Cartan (1837–1917), who was the village blacksmith. Anna had an elder sister Jeanne-Marie (1867–1931) who became a dressmaker, a brother Léon (1872–1956) who became a blacksmith working in his father\\'s smithy, and a middle brother Élie Cartan (1869–1951) who became an acclaimed mathematician and sire of a family of mathematicians, notably his first son, Henri Cartan, who later became influential in the field.\\nAnna\\'s brother, Élie Cartan, later recalled that the family was very poor and his childhood had passed under \"blows of the anvil, which started every morning from dawn,\" and that \"his mother, during those rare minutes when she was free from taking care of the children and the house, was working with a spinning wheel.\" \\n\\n\\n== Mathematics career ==\\nAs the family was poor, it would have been very unusual for any of the children to attend college, but in 1901, partly under Élie\\'s influence, Anna Cartan entered École normale supérieure de jeunes filles in Sèvres near Paris, France. Anna chose to pursue mathematics to become a secondary school teacher. Among the courses she attended were those led by Marie Curie (who taught physics there from 1900 to 1906) and Jules Tannery. One of her friends was the scientist and women\\'s rights activist Eugénie (Feytis) Cotton who would become director of the school in 1936. Another friend was Marthe Baillaud, the niece of Jules Tannery. Anna completed her studies in mathematics in 1904 and taught the subject at the high school in Poitiers, France from 1904 to 1906, and then she taught in Dijon from 1906 to 1908.\\nIn 1908, Cartan received a one-year scholarship established by a French philanthropist Albert Kahn to travel around the world to allow her to \"enrich her skills and future education by direct knowledge of the world.\" Among the places she visited were the United States (New York, St. Louis, Chicago, Boston and Niagara Falls), Quebec, Mexico and Cuba. After the tour, she returned to Dijon and taught there until 1916. Then she taught at the Jules Ferry high school in Paris and, until 1920, at the Sèvres application school, annexed to the normal school.\\nIn 1912 and 1913, Cartan wrote two books on arithmetic and geometry for girls, and later she co-authored with her brother Élie two more textbooks for both boys and girls.\\nCartan died of cancer in 1923.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nArithmetic and geometry, first year, secondary education for young girls, by Anna Cartan, 1912 and 1921.\\nArithmetic, secondary education for young girls, second year, by Anna Cartan, 1913 and 1918.\\nArithmetic, secondary education, boys and girls, classes of 4th and 3rd, by Anna Cartan and Élie Cartan, 1928 and 1931.\\nArithmetic, secondary education, boys and girls, grades 6 and 5, by Anna Cartan and Élie Cartan, 1926.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

This was in later literature referred to as the Szmydt problem.\\nSzmydt\\'s textbook Fourier Transformation and Linear Differential Equations (1971) was the first on the topic to be published in the Polish language. Her motivation was to present the basics of the theory of partial differential equations with a particular emphasis on distributions in limit problems of the classical equations (the heat equation, Schrödinger equation, and the Laplace and Poisson equations).\\nIn Paley–Wiener theorems for the Mellin transformations (1990), Szmydt gave a full characterization of the space of multipliers for Mellin\\'s distribution in terms of the Mellin transform (equivalent to the Paley–Wiener theorem) and established relationships between Schwartz and Mellin distribution spaces.\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\nIn 1956, Szmydt won the Stefan Banach Prize of the Polish Mathematical Society for her research into topological methods in nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

Trimble Bozeman (née Sylvia Trimble, 1947) is an American mathematician and Mathematics educator.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nSylvia Bozeman was born in Camp Hill, Alabama on 1 August 1947. She was the third of five children to Horace T. Sr. and Robbie Jones. Although her father worked with numbers daily in his profession as an insurance agent, it was her mother, a housewife, who first cultivated Bozeman’s love for Mathematics. Bozeman attended segregated primary and secondary schools in Camp Hill, and was encouraged by her teachers and parents to continue her education. Her high school mathematics teacher, Mr. Frank Holley, further cultivated her interest. He came back after school and taught trigonometry (a course not offered in the curriculum) to her and a group of committed students.\\nBozeman graduated from Edward Bell High School in Camp Hill in 1964 and enrolled for her undergraduate studies in Mathematics at Alabama A&M University, during which she also worked on summer projects at NASA and Harvard University. She graduated in 1968 as salutatorian and moved with her husband Robert, also a mathematician, to non-segregated Vanderbilt University, where they both began their graduate studies. She earned a master\\'s degree in 1970, despite not having studied much of the prerequisite coursework that her white classmates had. In 1968 linear, algebra was just making its way on to the scene as a regular required course in Mathematics curricula. It was offered for the first time when she was a senior at Alabama A&M, but she didn\\'t take it. The Vanderbilt faculty suggested Bozeman take it her first year in graduate school, but when she realized it was an undergraduate course, she refused. \"I paid for that decision for the rest of my graduate years. I spent a long time trying to learn linear algebra on my own,\" she laments.\\n\\n\\n== Doctorate and career ==\\n\"As my career provides me with many opportunities of professional involvement, it is my commitment to always remain \\'connected\\' with Mathematics through teaching and/or other scholarly endeavors, and to continue to promote the development of women in Mathematics.\"—Sylvia Bozeman, 1997\\nThe Bozemans had a son and a daughter while Sylvia taught part-time at Vanderbilt and Tennessee State University and Robert finished his doctoral studies in Mathematics. The areas of her research and publications have included operator theory in functional analysis, projects in image processing, and efforts to enhance the success of groups currently underrepresented in mathematics. She earned her PhD with her thesis title : \"Representations of Generalized Inverses of Fredholm Operators.\" Graduating in 1980, Bozeman became only the 23rd or 24th black women Math Ph.D. in the U.S.\\nIn 1974, Bozeman took a teaching position at Spelman College, a college for Black women in Atlanta, Georgia; Robert was then teaching at Morehouse College, another historically Black college. For over 35 years she has taught Mathematics at America\\'s oldest historically black college for women. Located just west of downtown, Spelman\\'s campus sits adjacent Morehouse College. While there, she worked under Shirley Mathis McBay, Etta Zuber Falconer, and Gladys Glass, mathematicians who were pushing to improve Spelman\\'s science and Mathematics programs. She began as an instructor in 1974, became assistant professor in 1980, an associate in 1984, and full professor in 1991.Throughout her years at Spelman, professor Bozeman taught a variety of classes—calculus, abstract algebra, transition to higher Math, and even her old nemesis linear algebra. She also enjoyed mentoring students and junior faculty.  In 1976, Bozeman took up graduate studies again at Emory University while continuing to hold a position at Spelman.

Moreover, Bozeman served as chair of the Mathematics Department from 1982 to 1993, as adjunct faculty in the Math Department at Atlanta University from 1983 to 1985.

Male faculty tend to be less sensitive to the ways in which women treat their studies, Bozeman says. For example, in class, women might say very little unless they really know what they are talking about. \"Women make a B on an exam and they are crushed, they think it\\'s terrible. Men make a B and they think it\\'s great,\" she says. The EDGE program brings in senior graduates and panelists. The students form study groups and learn how to give and receive information. Critical to graduate school survival, says Bozeman. In 2007 the EDGE Program was given special recognition by the American Mathematical Society for its effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n== Research and recognition ==\\nBozeman\\'s  research has focused on functional analysis and image processing, and has been funded by the Army Research Office, National Science Foundation, and NASA.\\nHer efforts to encourage women from underrepresented groups to pursue graduate degrees in Mathematics were recognized by President Obama when he appointed her to the President’s Committee on the National Medal of Science.

       "  \"Ruth Gentry (February 22, 1862 – October 18, 1917) was a pioneering American woman mathematician during the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. She was the first Indiana-born woman to acquire a PhD degree in mathematics, and most likely the first woman born in Indiana to receive a doctoral degree in any scientific discipline.\\n\\n\\n== Early years and education ==\\nRuth Ellen Gentry was the youngest of three children born to Jeremiah Gentry (1827–1906) and Lucretia (Wilcox) Gentry (1830–1909). Jeremiah was a farmer and stock trader who moved to Hendricks County, Indiana from Bullitt County, Kentucky, when he was five years old, and remained there the rest of his life. Ruth and her siblings, Oliver (1853–1878) and Mary Frances (1860–1929), were born and grew up on the family farm near Stilesville, Indiana. Ruth's early education took place there as well.\\nGentry attended Indiana State Normal School, a teachers' college that had opened in 1870 but did not yet award bachelor's degrees. After graduating in 1880, she taught at preparatory schools for ten years. In 1885, she decided to get her bachelor's degree at the University of Michigan—at that time one the few American colleges to admit women as undergraduates. She studied mathematics for a year and then went back to teaching school, moving to Florida for the years 1886–88 to teach at DeLand Academy and College (which changed its name while she was there to DeLand University).\\nGentry did her graduate work starting in 1890 at Bryn Mawr College, which at that time was one of the only institutions of higher education in the country to admit women for graduate studies. In 1891 she was a Fellow in Mathematics at Bryn Mawr. Following her first year, she was awarded the Association of College Alumnae European Fellowship, becoming the first mathematician and second recipient of the honor. She used the fellowship to study in Europe in 1891–92. Gentry went first to Germany in the hope of being allowed to sit in on lectures by German mathematicians at one of the country's universities (which at the time did not admit women). After she had been turned down by numerous professors, Lazarus Fuchs of the University of Berlin secured permission for her to attend lectures by himself and Ludwig Schlesinger. This arrangement lasted only one semester before being revoked by university administrators. She remained in Europe for an additional semester, attending lectures in mathematics at the Sorbonne in Paris.\\nUpon her return to Bryn Mawr, Gentry was appointed a fellow in mathematics for 1892–93, after which she stayed on another year as a fellow by courtesy of the school. She became Charlotte Scott's first graduate student, and in 1894 she finished her doctoral work at Bryn Mawr. Her thesis, On the Forms of Plane Quartic Curves, was not published until 1896, which is why she is sometimes described as one of Scott's first two students, along with Isabel Maddison.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter earning her PhD, Gentry taught at Vassar College, becoming the first person on the mathematics faculty at Vassar to hold a doctoral degree. In 1900 she was made associate professor.\\nTwo years later, suffering from health issues, Gentry left Vassar to become the associate principal and head of the mathematics department at Miss Gleim's, a private school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1905 she left this position and became a volunteer nurse. She traveled in the United States and Europe for a time, but suffered from further health problems. Her illness progressed until she died of breast cancer in Indianapolis, Indiana at the age of 55 on October 18, 1917. She is buried in Stilesville Cemetery in Stilesville, Indiana.\\n\\n\\n== Mathematical interests ==\\nGentry's main interest was in geometry, especially the study of quartic curves, which was the content of her thesis.\\n\\n\\n== Honors ==\\nIn 1894, while still at Bryn Mawr, Gentry became a member of the New York Mathematical Society, which later became the American Mathematical Society.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",

       "  \"Carina Curto (born 15 April 1978) is an American mathematician, a professor at Pennsylvania State University, and a Sloan Research Fellow. She is known for her work on mathematical neuroscience, including the applications of mathematics in both theoretical and computational neuroscience. Her recent work is funded by the BRAIN Initiative. She is an associate editor at SIAGA, a SIAM journal on applied algebra and geometry and on the editorial board at Physical Review Research.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCurto was born to Argentine parents and grew up in Iowa City. She attended Iowa City West High School. During her school years, she attended courses at University of Iowa, including advanced mathematics classes, physics, computer science, French literature, and more. In 1996, she began studying for an A.B. in Physics at Harvard University. During her time at Harvard, she was awarded prizes including the Detur Book Prize, one of Harvard's oldest awards, and the American Physical Society minority scholarship. After graduating from Harvard in 2000 and being awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, Curto started a Ph.D in mathematics at Duke University. Curto's Ph.D. focused on mathematical string theory and algebraic geometry. Her thesis was titled 'Matrix Model Superpotentials and Calabi-Yau Spaces: an ADE Classification'.\\n\\n\\n== Career and research ==\\nOnce Curto gained her Ph.D., she moved to Rutgers University in New Jersey, working as a postdoctoral associate in a neuroscience lab at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience. After three years at Rutgers, she returned to working in mathematics, focusing on neuroscience from a more mathematical perspective, and moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematics at New York University, then to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, followed by the Pennsylvania State University. Curto is a professor of mathematics, the co-head of their mathematical neuroscience lab, and a member of the Center for Neural Engineering.\\n\\n\\n=== Network connectivity ===\\nHer research focuses on the interplay between the connectivity and dynamics of the brain and involves studying neural recordings and analysing the patterns of the activities. This network analysis aims to understand the connections between the neurons and their patterns. Traditionally, neuroscientists rely on tools from physics. But Curto's approach uses tools from pure mathematics, particularly algebraic geometry, which is applied to the activity data of the neurons. Curto's research is significant in the field of connectomics. For instance, one study showed how neural activities can drastically change by slightly changing the structure of the networks, which has implications for the study of brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.\\nAlong with Katherine Morrison from the University of Northern Colorado, and with funding from the government's BRAIN Initiative grant and the NSF, Curto is working on Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Networks, CTLNs. These models enable the observations of emergent patterns, such as neuronal sequences and complex rhythms, and can also be used to predict features of the dynamics, something that has been seemingly difficult to predict.\\nAligned with her research, Curto, alongside Morrison, also created a project called Network Songs, which originally started out as a gimmick. This is a collection of songs, that show the rhythmic activity of the networks. The basis of the songs were created by assigning a note on the piano to each neuron. Curto explains that sometimes certain patterns are better distinguished by the ear, than by the eye, hence the purpose of this particular representation of the network data.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and personal life ==\\nCurto has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, including becoming a Woodrow Wilson National Fellow and an Alfred Sloan Research Fellow. Additionally, in 2012, Curto was named a UNL Academic Star. In 2021 she was named a Simons Fellow in Mathematics.\\nIn March 2018, the American Mathematical Society, AMS, included Curto in a list of 27 female mathematicians in honour of Women's History Month, publishing a profile of her in the AMS Notices journal.\\nThroughout her years as a mathematician, Curto has taken part in many events and boards to promote women in mathematics. This includes being involved with the Women In Math club at UNL and being part of the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics, NCUWM, organizing committee.\\nCurto is also an amateur tennis player. In 1995, when at high school, she became the Double State Champion.

She was awarded a Clothworker\\'s Guild Scholarship to study at Girton College, Cambridge, where she matriculated in 1889. A fellow student who matriculated at Girton at the same time as Maddison was Grace Chisholm (later Grace Chisholm Young). Maddison attended lectures at Cambridge by Cayley, Whitehead and Young. In 1892 Maddison passed the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam earning a First Class degree, equal to the twenty-seventh Wrangler, but she was not allowed to receive a degree, as, at this time, women could not formally receive a degree at Cambridge. Instead, she was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science with Honors from the University of London in 1893. Her fellow student Grace Chisholm also earned a First Class degree in the same Mathematical Tripos examinations.\\n\\nOn completing her studies at Cambridge, Maddison was awarded a scholarship which enabled her to spend the year 1892–93 at Bryn Mawr College in the US. There she undertook research under the direction of Charlotte Scott, the first woman to earn a First Class degree at Cambridge (in 1880).  Maddison was awarded the resident mathematics fellowship, and then a Mary E. Garrett Fellowship for study abroad. She used the latter to study at the University of Göttingen in the academic year 1893–1894, where she attended lectures by Felix Klein and David Hilbert.  Right before that, in 1893, Maddison sat the University of London exams, and as a result was awarded a BSc with Honors. \\nShe received her PhD from Bryn Mawr in 1896.\\n\\n\\n== Career and later life ==\\nMaddison had, like Scott, become interested in linear algebra through the influence of Cayley at Cambridge. When she first reached Bryn Mawr College, Maddison continued to work on this topic but later, advised by Scott, she began to work on singular solutions of differential equations. Although she had earned the equivalent of a First Class degree at Cambridge, Maddison still had no degree so she took the external examinations of the University of London in 1893 which allowed her to graduate with a BSc with honours. Bryn Mawr College awarded her their Residential Mathematical Fellowship which funded her studies for the year 1893–94. She was next awarded the Mary E. Garrett European Fellowship, which enabled her to spend 1894–95 at Göttingen in Germany. There she met again Grace Chisholm, who was studying for her doctorate under Klein. Maddison attended lectures by Klein, Hilbert, and Burkhardt during her year at Göttingen where she played a full part in the exciting mathematical atmosphere of the department.\\nShe continued working at Bryn Mawr, where she taught as well as doing time-consuming administrative work.\\nIn 1895, Maddison returned to Bryn Mawr College to take up the position of assistant to the president of the college, M. Carey Thomas. Until 1902, M. Carey Thomas held both the position of dean and of president, so Maddison had a busy life as her assistant. It was a position which took up so much of her time that she was unable to continue with mathematical research, but she did complete her doctorate under Scott\\'s supervision.\\nShe was awarded a PhD in 1896 for her thesis On Singular Solutions of Differential Equations of the First Order in Two Variables and the Geometrical Properties of Certain Invariants and Covariants of Their Complete Primitives and in the same year appointed as Reader in Mathematics at Bryn Mawr. Her paper On certain factors of c- and p-discriminants and their relations to fixed points in the family of curves which she published in the Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics was based on her doctoral dissertation and she was awarded the Gambel Prize. She also published an English translation of Klein\\'s address in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1896 and in the Bulletin of 1897 a Note on the History of the Map Coloring Problem.\\nIn 1904, she was appointed both associate professor and assistant to the president. Her will endowed $10,000 in memory of President M. Carey Thomas to be used as a pension fund for Bryn Mawr\\'s administrative staff. She has also put together a thorough listing of university courses open to women at the time in British and Canadian universities. In 1897, she was elected membership to the American Mathematical Society as well as a life member of the London Mathematical Society. She was also a member of the Daughters of the British Empire.\\nMaddison remained at Bryn Mawr until she retired in 1926.\\nAfter Maddison retired she returned to England for a time, but later went back to Pennsylvania, where she spent time writing poetry rather than mathematics. Her will gave a large sum of money in the memory of M. Carey Thomas, who died in 1935, to be used as pension funds for non-faculty members of staff at Bryn Mawr. In a tribute by the board of directors after her death, she was remembered for \"her natural and gentle sweetness, her love of youth, and her sensitivity.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\"Isabel Maddison\", on the Mathematics Genealogy Project\\n\"Charlotte Scott: An Appreciation\", Bryn Mawr Alumnae Bulletin written by Isabel Maddison\\nGreen, Judy; LaDuke, Jeanne (2008).

She has been named as a pioneer of mathematics in Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGarín was born on 1 January 1914 in Asturias, Spain. Her mother and step-father escaped World War I by moving to Cuba, where she was home-taught by her step-father, an engineer for a mining company. After several years, they moved to  Pinar del Río in Cuba, where she first entered formal schooling. In the economic and political crisis in Cuba under the reign of Gerardo Machado, the family began working for the political opposition but in 1932, in fear for their lives, moved to Mexico, using counterfeit Spanish passports. In Mexico, she became an activist in the Communist Party.\\nShe married Raúl Álvarez, an engineer. Their son, Raúl Álvarez Garín (1914–2014), was also a prominent activist, one of the leaders in the Mexican Movement of 1968 and later a professor of economics at UNAM. Although initially studying mathematics, their daughter Tania Álvarez Garín became a ballerina and choreographer.\\n\\n\\n== Academic career ==\\nOnce in Mexico, Garín caught up on the Mexican school curriculum through the Colegio Motolinía. But, because her Cuban education had omitted singing and sports, she was blocked from entering the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria until her family obtained an exception with the assistance of the Cuban ambassador to Mexico. She studied chemistry there, encouraged by her mother to aim for career as a pharmacist, as engineering work was not open to women at that time. However, she was encouraged to study mathematics by one of her teachers, Alfonso Nápoles Gándara.\\nThere was at that time an arrangement that ENP chemistry students could enter the science program at UNAM, but Garín had to overcome bureaucratic opposition to her entry, which she did in 1937 with the intervention of geophysicist Ricardo Monges López, entering alongside Enriqueta González Baz, and becoming the first women in the UNAM Faculty of Sciences.\\nAfter graduating, marrying, living with her husband in Sinaloa and Ensenada, and then teaching at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education for several years, she joined the UNAM Faculty of Engineering in 1951, and in 1952 began teaching as well in the Faculty of Sciences. She also worked as a researcher in the UNAM Institute of Geophysics, led by Monges. In this time, she also completed a master's thesis in probability theory, supervised by Remigio Valdés. As a professional mathematician, Garín specialized in applied mathematics involving the mathematical modeling of the Earth's magnetic field; she also worked on secondary-school mathematics education.\\nIn her later work, she helped found the Institute of Geophysics in the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán and in 1964 became the founding director of the School of Advanced Studies of the Universidad de Sonora. She retired as a professor emerita of the Faculty of Engineering of UNAM in 1989.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 2020, a science contest for primary and secondary school girls was named in honor of Garín by the government of Mexico City.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nManuela Garín Pinillos de Álvarez, Matemáticos en México\",\n",
       "  'Florence Marie Mears (May 18, 1896 – December 3, 1995) was a professor of Mathematics at The George Washington University.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nMears was born in Baltimore, Maryland and attended Baltimore public schools.  She received her undergraduate degree in mathematics at Goucher College, earning a Phi Beta Kappa Key. She received a master\\'s degree from Cornell University in 1924 after completing her thesis on \"A Special Function of One Variable.\" She then went on to achieve her doctorate from Cornell in 1927, completing her thesis on the \"Riesz Summability for Double Series\" (published in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society in 1928)[M28] with thesis advisor Wallie Abraham Hurwitz.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nMears\\'s first job as a college professor was at the Women\\'s College of Alabama; she soon left to become an associate professor of mathematics at Pennsylvania State College, and then joined The George Washington University in 1929.\\nAt George Washington University, Mears was known for her popularity among both her students and fellow faculty members. She was considered by the university\\'s president as \"one of the greatest teachers of mathematics in the entire country.\" During her first year at The George Washington University, Mears taught as an assistant professor of mathematics in the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Her office could be found directly on campus at 2033 G Street. At the beginning of her career at GW, Mears was the only woman in the Mathematics department, which included seven other professors. Additionally, it was reported that she was paid substantially less than her male co-workers.\\nMears earned the title of being a master teacher. According to the criteria set by the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, Mears earned this title due to her excellent teaching skills, and her contributions in both research and the Mathematics Department. Among the many classes that she taught were Advanced Calculus, Introduction to Analysis, Introduction to Infinite Series, and Fourier Series and Spherical Harmonics. In 1955, George Washington University awarded her an Alumni Citation for twenty-five years of distinguished service. In 1958, the University of California selected her as one of ten female mathematicians to work on a project studying creativity. In 1962, she became a member of an examining committee, which focused on selecting doctoral dissertations in mathematics for the University of Allahabad in India.\\nMears specialized in the findings of definitions and values assigned to various infinite series of numbers. An \"infinite series\" is an endless series of numbers, each succeeding the other that is a certain amount lesser or greater than the proceeding one. An example set of an infinite series includes is 1 + ½ + ¼ etc. in which the definition of the series can be defined as the number two. As a result, Mears created several theorems about these definitions, many of which provided truth for many practicing mathematicians, engineers, chemists, physicists, and astronomers. One of her most popular theorems, called the Norlund Mean can be explained through absolute regularity, the summability of Cauchy products, and inverse properties.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nMears\\' participation in professional, honorary, and civic organizations included a professional membership in the American Math Society, and in the American Math Association. Her various honorary memberships included the Washington Academy of Science, Phi Beta Kappa (1927), Phi Kappa Phi (1927), and Sigma XI (1924). Additionally, she held several fellowships at Cornell University during the years 1925 to 1927. Mears also published several articles and book reviews in leading mathematical journals.\\n\\n\\n== Students ==\\nMears helped Janos Edvard Hanson and Joseph Blum earn their Ph.D.s from the George Washington University. Joseph Blum earned his Ph.D. in 1958 following his completion of his dissertation on Banach Spaces Functionals and Matrix Summability Method. Two years later, Mears would also aid Janos Edvard Hanson in earning his Ph.D. in 1960, after writing his final dissertation on Linear Sequence Spaces, which permit omission and adjunction and have Finite Dimension Modulo Convergence.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nMears was named professor emerita of Mathematics in 1965. A professor emeritus or emeritus professor is a title that may be given to a full professor who retires in good standing. According to the American Council on Education it is typically awarded for \"long and distinguished service\".  She is considered not only one of The George Washington University\\'s greatest mathematicians, but also one of the finest and most active mathematicians in the United States of America.

       "  'Jean E. Sammet (March 23, 1928 – May 20, 2017) was an American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962. She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language.\\nShe received her B.A. in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A. in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949.  She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978.\\nSammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group.  From 1958 to 1961, she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group. She joined IBM in 1961  where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs.  She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979.\\nSammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was the first female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928, in New York City. Jean and her sister, Helen, were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School.\\nSammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois, where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951. When Sammet first encountered a computer, in 1949 at the University of Illinois, she was not impressed, considering it an obscene piece of hardware.\\nIn 1951, Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nIn 1951, Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her.\\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy’s submarine program during her time there. In early January 1955, Sammet began her life as a programmer. Sperry Gyroscope was working on a digital computer, the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer (SPEEDAC) and asked Sammet to be their programmer. Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC, which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary.\\nSammet became the group leader of what was called an “open shop” as Sperry began hiring more programmers. The “open shop” consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines. The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations. In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand. This brought Sammet into contact with the UNIVAC I computer and Grace Hopper.\\nIn fall of 1956, Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of Adelphi College (now University) on Long Island. Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time, Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years.\\nSammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point. The classified job advertisements at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men’s list and found an engineer position at Sylvania Electric Products in Needham, Massachusetts. Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the MOBIDIC project by Carl Hammer, the person responsible for Sylvania’s software development.\\nIn 1959, Sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential COBOL programming language, in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by Sylvania\\'s U.S. government clients.\\nSammet published Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals in 1969. The book gives an overview of 120 programming languages being used in the United States as of the late 1960s.\\n\\n\\n== Ties to ACM ==\\nAround 1965 or 1966, Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on FORMAC. She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field. After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM, Sammet contacted George Forsythe, president of ACM from 1964 to 1966, who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation.\\nIn order to gain interest in SICSAM, Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time. She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM).\\nIn June 1966, Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative (1966-1968). She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer (1967, 1968, and 1972). Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968, Sammet became chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs.\\nIn 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN. She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972. As chairperson of SIGPLAN, she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups. Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing.\\nSammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974. Working with the president of ACM at the time, Tony Ralston, Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority. At the time of her vice presidency, ACM was almost bankrupt. Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference. Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nSammet died on May 20, 2017, in Silver Spring, Maryland, after a brief illness.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\nSammet, Jean E.

She is one of ten winners and the only female winner of the European Mathematical Society Prize for 2016 \"for her outstanding research regarding the development and analysis of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations with a focus on applications to problems with dynamically changing geometry\". The topic of Zahedi\\'s EMS Prize lecture was her recent research on the CutFEM method of solving fluid dynamics problems with changing boundary geometry, such as arise when simulating the dynamics of systems of two immiscible liquids. This method combines level set methods to represent the domain boundaries as cuts through an underlying uniform grid, together with numerical simulation techniques that can adapt to the complex geometries of grid cells cut by these boundaries.\\nWhen Zahedi was ten years old, with her father having been killed by the regime after the Iranian Revolution, her mother sent her on her own as a refugee to Sweden, and only rejoined her some years later. She was drawn to mathematics in part because she understood mathematics better than the Swedish language, and to fluid mechanics because of its real-world applications. She earned a master\\'s degree from KTH in 2006, and a doctorate in 2011; her dissertation, Numerical Methods for Fluid Interface Problems, was supervised by Gunilla Kreiss.

       " 'Contemporary_artists': ['José Bernal Romero (January 8, 1925 – April 19, 2010) was a Cuban-American artist, born in Santa Clara, Cuba, in the former province of Las Villas (now Villa Clara). He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1980.\\nBernal\\'s aesthetics stemmed from his Cuban birth and the experience of exile and renewal.  His art has been described as modernist, abstract, and expressionist.  The term postmodernist also may be applied to Bernal\\'s diverse and complex body of work, specifically as he rejected the notion of the new in art, a characteristic imbued in postmodern theory.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Life in Cuba ===\\n\\nA a child, Bernal was privately tutored in art and music. He graduated from Normal Teachers College in 1945 and began teaching at a series of public and private schools in the province of Las Villas. Simultaneously, he enrolled in the Escuela de Artes Plásticas Leopoldo Romañach where he earned his MFA. His musical and visual creations were performed and exhibited in Santa Clara and Havana.\\nIn 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Bernal was among the throngs of Cubans arrested for unpatriotic behavior, and was confined for eleven days in the gymnasium of the Marta Abreu University in Santa Clara.  Bernal\\'s offense was refusal to work in the fields cutting sugar cane.  After his release, the threat of execution haunted him and his wife, and they cautiously initiated plans to leave the country with their three young children. It took more than a year to obtain visas. With the help of the Methodist Church, the Bernals were able to board a Pan Am flight for the United States of America in June 1962.\\n\\n\\n=== Life in the United States ===\\nThe Bernal family entered the United States at Miami, Florida.  Their stay in the state was brief – a few months, on account of the scarcity of employment. Subsequently, in autumn of 1962 they relocated to Chicago, Illinois. Bernal confronted the need to support his family and, because of language barriers, became employed in a factory designing artistic materials for commercial purposes. Meanwhile, he continued to produce personal art. Critics observed that his work during this period revealed a transformation affected by the change in geographical environment. While in Cuba his palette did not reflect the brilliant, intense colors of his native land; but in Chicago he began to incorporate the tropical hues of his Caribbean homeland into his art.\\nIn 1964, Bernal\\'s art portfolio was reviewed by an executive at Marshall Field\\'s and he was offered a position as Senior Designer. There, the director of Field\\'s fine arts gallery persuaded Bernal to exhibit his impressionist portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Shortly thereafter, Betty Parsons, art dealer, artist, and collector, discovered Bernal\\'s work and began a series of orders to show and sell his paintings at Dayton\\'s art galleries in Minneapolis. The lucrative connection made it possible for Bernal to give up his job at Marshall Field\\'s and return to school where he could pursue his dual dream of teaching and painting.\"\\nAfter being granted an MFA evaluation by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970, Bernal returned to teaching art while continuing to create and exhibit his works. Lydia Murman, art critic of the New Art Examiner, wrote about Bernal\\'s 1981 solo exhibition of collage and assemblage: \"Bernal\\'s works involve the viewer because they resurrect the concern for art as a communicative force. The viewer reacts to the classical arrangement, in which found objects are manipulated with a respect for their physical properties and for their potential symbolic value. While warm wood, old newspaper print, tarnished metal, and antique objects produce an aura that absorbs the viewer and stirs archetypal images within his subconscious, some works, such as \"Balancing the Unbalanced,\" in which a faucet is perceived as a faucet, invite the viewer to open the dialogue concerning substance and illusion, art and reality.\"\\n\\nAlthough Bernal and his family didn\\'t realize it, the first signs of Parkinson\\'s disease began to appear during the 1980s, and he was eventually diagnosed in 1993. He continued to work, to move forward and fight back against the ravages of the disease. In 2004, Bernal donated a number of his paintings to the National Parkinson Foundation in Miami, Florida, which auctioned them off to benefit the foundation. Bernal\\'s tremendous contribution eventually expanded to some 300 works of art.\"\\nBernal\\'s work is annotated in two books by Dorothy Chaplik on Latin American art: Latin American Arts and Cultures and Defining Latin American Art/Hacia una definición del arte latinoamericano. In her essay The Art of José Bernal she discusses Bernal\\'s oeuvre, and describes his artistic process as he traversed life\\'s challenges, including political unrest in Cuba, his personal battle with Parkinson\\'s disease, and his passion for his art.\\nBernal died of complications from Parkinson\\'s disease on April 19, 2010, at his home in Skokie, Illinois. Documents on his life and art are archived in the Institute for Latino Studies of the Julian Samora Library at the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana.\\n\\n\\n== Museum collections ==\\nBernal has artwork in a number of permanent collections, including:\\n\\nSan Antonio Museum of Art, San Antonio, Texas\\nTucson Museum of Art and Historic Block, Tucson, Arizona\\nAsheville Art Museum, Asheville, North Carolina\\nCameron Art Museum, Wilmington, North Carolina\\nMcNay Art Museum, San Antonio, Texas\\nMary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, Evanston, Illinois\\nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois\\nInstitute for Latino Studies/University of Notre Dame, Indiana\\nArt Museum of the Americas, OAS, Washington, D.C.\\nEl Museo del Barrio, New York City\\nDePaul Art Museum, Chicago, Illinois\\nLoyola University Museum of Art, Chicago, Illinois\\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Spain\\nRetrospectives of Bernal\\'s work include those at:\\n\\nCameron Art Museum\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBernal Monograph in artnet\\nBernal in AskART\\nBernal in LatinAmericanArt.com\\nBernal in artprice\\nSan Antonio Current: Picasso\\'s Guernica tapestry riots amid works of political conscience.\\ncubaencuentro|cultura: Artistas cubanos en el medio oeste de EEUU.\\nJosé Bernal obituary in the Chicago Tribune\\nBernal: Richard Norton Gallery\\nGetty Union List of Artists (Research at the Getty)\\nJosé Bernal: Smithsonian American Art Museum Research Database\\nJosé Bernal: Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery Catalog of American Portraits\\nView works in Museum and Public Collections\\nArt Museum of the Americas\\nAsheville Art Museum\\nMcNay Art Museum, one of two collages by José Bernal in its collection.

       "  'Jack Goldstein (September 27, 1945 – March 14, 2003) was a Canadian born, California and New York-based performance and conceptual artist turned post-conceptual painter in the 1980s.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nGoldstein was born to a Jewish family in Montreal, Quebec, and moved as a boy to Los Angeles, California, where he attended high school in the 1960s and started taking an interest in learning about art.  He received his training at Chouinard Art Institute and was a member of the inaugural class of California Institute of the Arts, where he worked in post-studio art under John Baldessari, receiving an MFA in 1972.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nA performance artist with roots in minimalist sculpture and a conceptual artist who made experimental films and their audio equivalent on vinyl records, Goldstein divided his time between Los Angeles and New York City during the 1970s. While still a student at CalArts in 1972, he buried himself alive; with a stethoscope attached to his chest. He breathed air from plastic tubes while a red light above ground flashed to the rhythm of his beating heart.\\nIn the early 1970s as audio art and video recordings became more accessible to the general public, Goldstein seized the opportunity and began producing his own art records. Among his records were A Swim Against the Tide, A Faster Run (a recording of a stampede), The Tornado, Two Wrestling Cats and The Six Minute Drown. The Six Minute Drown in particular gained attention within the art world. In it, the dreary, agonizing sounds of a drowning man reverberate for six minutes.\\nGoldstein eventually became one of the linchpins of the Pictures Group, which gained its first recognition at Artists Space in New York City in the fall of 1977. During this time, he shared a studio building with James Welling.\\nThe Pictures artists, including Goldstein, Robert Longo and Troy Brauntuch came to the forefront of the early-1980s and flourished to varying degrees as the decade wore on. Goldstein began seriously to make paintings at this time. Eventually he became known for what he referred to as \"salon paintings\", designed both to be sold and secure for the artist a place in art history. Although he was accused by some of \"selling out\" to a bull market in painting, this tactic appropriated the art star mantle that Goldstein\\'s work always has assumed.\\nGoldstein began to concentrate on painting in the late 1970s. His paintings were based on photographic images of natural phenomena, science, and technology – the result of Goldstein\\'s intent to record \"the spectacular instant,\" as previously depicted in photography. Many of them depict streaking fighter jets, lightning storms, exploding nebulae and city skylines illuminated by fireworks or bombing raids. Using found photographs, and highlighting the reproduction or copy, Goldstein blew up details to near abstraction and then hired painters to apply them to canvases on boxlike stretchers that stand more than six inches off the wall. He was among the first contemporary painters to hire others to make his works.\\nBy the mid-’70s, Goldstein had stopped appearing in his films and performances and instead hired actors, stuntmen and light and sound technicians from the film industry. His films include the well-known Metro-Goldwyn Mayer (1975), a two-minute loop of the film studio’s roaring lion mascot on a blood red field, and Shane (1975), named for the trained German Shepherd that barks in response to inaudible commands from someone behind the camera.\\nMost of Goldstein\\'s work revolved around the concept of experience, the concept of grappling with the conflation of experience and our recording of it.  It asks whether documentation has become primary in our experience.\\nAs the 1980s continued there was less and less call for his paintings and Goldstein\\'s work sold less well than some others\\'. Reluctant to teach rather than practice full-time, Goldstein left New York in the early 1990s and returned to California where he lived out the decade in relative isolation.\\nHis early work was revived at the turn of the century and he resurfaced briefly to some renewed acclaim. He was featured in the 2004 Whitney Biennial as a major film influence alongside Stan Brakhage, less than a year after he committed suicide by hanging himself in San Bernardino, California on March 14, 2003.\\nGoldstein may be remembered for a certain post-conceptual representational approach to painting that helped shape a generation of artists and beyond, even though they might not even be aware of him.\\nA posthumous documentary was made on Goldstein in 2014, titled Jack Goldstein: Pictures and Sounds: ART/New York No. 67\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nGoldstein compiled an extensive exhibition record during his productive years. Even after he stopped painting and moved back to Southern California, museums continued to exhibit his work. In 2002, a show of his films and performances was presented at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and retrospectives were staged at the Maison de la culture de Grenoble in Grenoble, France, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University, Los Angeles. A large-scale retrospective was originally scheduled for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles but was canceled in 2010 by its then-director, Jeffrey Deitch; it was instead shown at the Orange County Museum of Art and the Jewish Museum in New York in 2013. A new exhibit called \"Disappearing\" at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth showcased Goldstein\\'s work (along with two other artists) in the summer of 2019.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of contemporary artists\\nContemporary art\\ndocumenta7\\nTellus Audio Cassette Magazine #21\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJack Goldstein at Galerie Buchholz\\nComplete Goldstein bibliography, gallery, photos, etc.\\nJack Goldstein x 10,000 The first American retrospective of the Canadian-born artist Jack Goldstein at The Jewish Museum, NY.\\nBolande, Jennifer (2011-06-30).

       "  'Robert Graham (August 19, 1938 – December 27, 2008) was a Mexican-born American sculptor based in the state of California in the United States. His monumental bronzes commemorate the human figure, and are featured in public places across America.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nGraham was born in Mexico City, Mexico on August 19, 1938, to Roberto Pena and Adelina Graham. Roberto Pena died when his son was six years old, and the boy, his mother Adelina, his grandmother Ana, and his aunt Mercedes left Mexico and moved to San Jose, California.\\nRobert Graham received his formal art training at San José State University and the San Francisco Art Institute. He continued his studies at the San Francisco Art Institute in California, finishing in 1964.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nBy the late 1960s, Graham had one-man exhibitions of his sculpture at important contemporary art galleries in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Cologne, and Essen, Germany. He, along with family members Joey and Steven, lived in London for a period before settling in Los Angeles in the early 1970s. His first solo exhibition in a museum was at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1972. Since then he has had dozens of one-man shows, including several at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\\nGraham used a range of materials and scales in his work. In the 1970s he created very small wax sculptures (circa 4 inches (10 cm)) in miniature dioramas, depicting people interacting in various contemporary environments, such as a living room or a beach scene.  Some of these interactions included sexual congress. Graham\\'s 1986 monument to the boxer Joe Louis is a 24-foot (7.3 m) bronze fist and forearm. He has created hundreds of nude figures and groupings in intermediate scales.\\nGraham\\'s first major monumental commission was the ceremonial gateway for the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, for the occasion of the 1984 Olympics. He also designed the commemorative silver dollar for the event. The gateway featured two bronze torsos, male and female, modeled on contestants in the games. The gateway was a major design element of an Olympiad noted for its lack of new construction. To the surprise of many, the nudity of the torsos became an issue in the media.\\nAfter 1984, Graham received many other commissions for monumental works, such as The Great Bronze Doors of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles (2002).\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGraham married his first wife Joey Graham in 1959. They have one son, Steven, born in 1963.\\nHe married actress Anjelica Huston in 1992, and they resided in an unusual dwelling in Venice, Los Angeles. Huston refused to move to the bohemian area, where he\\'d been living for years, unless Graham designed a custom home that balanced security with beauty. The result was a remarkable home behind a long, solid cement wall to separate them from the well-traveled sidewalks: it was nicknamed the fortress.\\nGraham made a cameo appearance in Huston\\'s movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, as the Venezuelan general near the beginning of the film standing on the deck of the ship. Wes Anderson mentions in the movie\\'s commentary that Graham has some aspects in common with Steve Zissou.\\nHe was interviewed in Visiting... with Huell Howser Episode 411.\\n\\n\\n== Honors ==\\nIn 1983, Graham was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008, that Graham would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts.

       "  'Ilya Iosifovich Kabakov (Russian: Илья́ Ио́сифович Кабако́в; September 30, 1933 – May 27, 2023) was a Russian–American conceptual artist, born in Dnipropetrovsk in what was then the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. He worked for thirty years in Moscow, from the 1950s until the late 1980s. After that he lived and worked on Long Island, United States.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nIlya Iosifovich Kabakov was born on September 30, 1933, in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His mother, accountant Bertha Judelevna Solodukhina, and his father, locksmith Iosif Bentcionovitch Kabakov, were Jewish. Ilya was evacuated during World War II to Samarkand with his mother. There he started attending the school of the Leningrad Academy of Art which was evacuated to Samarkand. His classmates included the painter Mikhail Turovsky.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nAfter the World War II his family moved to Moscow. From 1945 to 1951, he studied at the Moscow Art School; in 1957 he graduated from V.I. Surikov State Art Institute, Moscow, where he specialized in graphic design and book illustration.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nUnlike many underground Soviet artists, Kabakov joined the Union of Soviet Artists in 1959 and became a full member in 1962. This was a prestigious position in the USSR and it brought with it substantial material benefits. In general, Kabakov illustrated children\\'s books for 3 to 6 months a year and then spent the remainder of his time on his own projects.\\nIn the vibrant art scene of 1970s Moscow, Ilya Kabakov\\'s unconventional talent found an unexpected champion in Dina Vierny, a distinguished gallerist with a keen eye for groundbreaking art. Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism, discovered Kabakov. The fateful meeting occurred on the evening of January 16, 1970, when Vierny recognized Kabakov as an artist of exceptional originality, despite being unknown and prohibited from exhibiting in Moscow. Vierny\\'s genuine interest in Kabakov\\'s work transcended time, enduring for over 27 years. Despite Kabakov\\'s infrequent exhibitions in Moscow, his drawings managed to captivate international audiences. Vierny not only encouraged Kabakov to leave the Soviet Union for broader recognition but also actively supported him by acquiring a substantial number of his works. This support was not limited to Kabakov alone; Vierny, upon her return, brought back works by other non-conformist artists such as Erik Boulatov and Vladimir Yankilevsky, known as the Group of Boulevard Sretensky. Together, these artists, despite differing styles, shared a common struggle against state-imposed artistic limitations, particularly the constraints of socialist realism. Vierny\\'s commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition \"Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973\" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.\\n\\n\\n== The 1980s ==\\nBetween 1983 and 2000, Kabakov created 155 installations. Of these, one of the best known installations is The Man Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment. First created in 1985 in a secret attic studio in Moscow, Kabakov later recreated the piece in the United States at Ronald Feldman Gallery in 1988. The installation portrays a small, run-down bedroom with a large hole in the ceiling and propaganda photos covering the walls. The exhibition was widely reviewed, securing Kabakov\\'s reputation in the New York art world. \\n\\n\\n== Personal life and death ==\\nIn 1989, Kabakov began working with his niece,  curator and dealer Emilia Kanevsky, who would later become his wife and who emigrated from the USSR in 1973. Kabakov had met her when she lived in Dnipropetrovsk.  For three decades, the couple collaborated on numerous exhibitions, including Documenta in 1992, the Venice Biennale in 1993, the Whitney Biennial in 1997, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in 2004, and the Tate Modern and the Hirshhorn in 2017.\\nKabakov died on May 27, 2023, at the age of 89.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and collectors ==\\nFollowing Mikhail Chemiakin\\'s 1995 show, Ilya Kabakov had one of the first major solo exhibitions of a living Russian artist at the new State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in 2004.\\nHis works are included in the collections of the Zimmerli Art Museum, the Centre Pompidou (Beaubourg), Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim, The Hermitage, Tretjakov Gallery (Moscow), Norway Museum Of Contemporary Art, the Kolodzei Art Foundation and museums in Columbus, Ohio, Frankfurt, and Köln, etc.\\nIn 2017 the Tate Modern in London exhibited Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. set up an exhibition Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: The Utopian Projects.\\nNational Museum of Norway (Norway) has \"Søppelmannen\" [\\'the garbage man\\'] on permanent display.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Russian artists\\nMoscow Conceptualism\\nIrina Nakhova\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nAlexander Rappaport.

       "  'Dan Christensen, (October 6, 1942 – January 20, 2007) was an American abstract painter \\nHe is best known for paintings that relate to Lyrical Abstraction, Color field painting,  and Abstract expressionism.\\nChristensen was born in Cozad, Nebraska, and died in Easthampton, New York. His early work from 1965-1966 was related to Minimalism. A graduate of the Kansas City Art Institute, class of 1964, where he studied alongside Ronnie Landfield and Sherron Francis, Dan Christensen moved to New York City from the Mid-West during the late summer of 1965. Christensen was represented by several influential galleries including the Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Salander/O\\'Reilly Gallery and various others throughout the United States and Europe. He has had more than seventy-five solo exhibitions and his work has been included in hundreds of group exhibitions. His paintings are in important museum collections throughout the United States and Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Art world beginnings ==\\nDan Christensen arrived in New York City in the summer of 1965 from the Mid-West, with the purpose of establishing himself as an important contemporary abstract painter. With his friend from Iowa - the painter David Wagner, he rented a loft on Great Jones Street in lower Manhattan. After several months of experimenting on new abstract paintings with interlocking rectangular \"L\" shapes in shades of tan, grey, ochre and brown that resembled jigsaw puzzles in oil paint, he began to use acrylic paint. Christensen began painting the series of abstract paintings for which he became first known - his Minimal \"Bar\" paintings in the spring of 1966. After Dave Wagner returned to Iowa in March 1966, his friend the painter Ronnie Landfield shared his Great Jones Street loft with him until the early winter of 1967.\\nDan Christensen was part of a large circle of young artists who had come to Manhattan during the 1960s. Kenneth Showell, Peter Young, Michael Steiner, Ronnie Landfield, Dick Anderson, his brother Don Christensen, Peter Reginato, Carlos Villa, David R. Prentice, James Monte, Frosty Myers, Tex Wray, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Robert Povlich, Neil Williams (artist), Carl Gliko, Billy Hoffman,  Francine Tint, Lee Lozano, Pat Lipsky, John Griefen, Brice Marden, John Chamberlain, Donald Judd, Frank Stella, Carl Andre, Dan Graham, Robert Smithson, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Kenneth Noland, Clement Greenberg, Bob Neuwirth, Joseph Kosuth, Mark di Suvero, Sherron Francis, Brigid Berlin, Lawrence Weiner, Rosemarie Castoro, Marjorie Strider, Dorothea Rockburne, Colette, and Marisol were just a few of the artists he saw regularly at Max\\'s Kansas City — the favorite place for artists in New York City during the 1960s.\\n\\n\\n== Early career ==\\nIn the late fall of 1966 the art dealer Richard Bellamy visited the Great Jones Street loft and began to represent Dan Christensen\\'s work. Bellamy invited Christensen to exhibit his paintings at the Noah Goldowsky Gallery in the late spring of 1967. Dorothy Herzka co-curated a group exhibition that included Dan Christensen, Ronnie Landfield, Kenneth Showell, and Peter Gourfain in February 1967 at the Bianchini Gallery on W. 57th Street in Manhattan. All of those four painters were invited to be included in the Whitney Museum of American Art\\'s 1967 Annual exhibition. In the late spring of 1967 Dan Christensen began painting with spray guns and produced his first \"linear spray paintings,\" for which he became famous. By 1968 he began to exhibit his paintings in important art galleries from New York to California and worldwide. In the late 1960s he participated in several important exhibitions that traveled throughout the United States, including the Lyrical Abstraction Exhibition that originated at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. During the remainder of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s Christensen regularly exhibited his paintings at the André Emmerich Gallery, the Noah Goldowsky Gallery in New York City, the Rolf Ricke Gallery in W. Germany, the Nicholas Wilder Gallery in Los Angeles, and the Meredith Long Gallery both in Houston Texas, and New York City.\\nDan Christensen\\'s paintings were included in the Whitney Museum of American Art\\'s annual exhibition\\'s in 1967, 1968 and 1969 and in the first biennial exhibition in 1973. During the late 1960s and 1970s Dan Christensen\\'s paintings were included in numerous group exhibitions, in influential galleries and museums. His work was included in several important articles in the media about the newest generation of American artists. His work was discussed and reviewed in The New York Times, Newsweek, Artforum, Art in America, Art News, and many other periodicals. In 1968 he was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Grant and he was awarded a 1969 Guggenheim fellowship.\\n\\n\\n== Late career ==\\nChristensen\\'s abstract paintings changed and evolved throughout his career. During the final ten years of his life he moved with his family to East Hampton, New York from Manhattan. From November 2001 through February 2002 Christensen had a retrospective exhibition at The Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio; and shows of his paintings in galleries in Boca Raton, Florida, Houston, Texas, Santa Fe, New Mexico, New York City and in 2007 he had a retrospective exhibition at the Spanierman Gallery in Manhattan. His paintings are in the permanent collections of The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Museum of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York City, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Washington, DC., the Chicago Art Institute, the Nelson-Atkins Museum Kansas City, Missouri, Boca Raton Museum of Art and dozens of others.\\n\\n\\n== Recent ==\\nOn January 18, 2007 Dan Christensen enjoyed the opening of an important survey exhibition of paintings selected from his long painting career, spanning the years from 1966 until 2007 at the Spanierman Gallery on E. 58th Street in Manhattan.\\nAfter enduring Polymyositis for nearly nineteen years, Dan Christensen died on Saturday, January 20, 2007.\\nHe is survived by his wife Elaine Grove Christensen (sculptor & actress), and his three sons: Moses, James (of the Hip Hop group Junk Science, currently signed to Definitive Jux records) and William, his brother Don and his two sisters Marilyn and Kay.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nhttp://www.danchristensen.com/\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/27/obituaries/27christensen.html\\nhttp://spaniermanmodern.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/video-elaine-grove-on-dan-christensens-plaid-paintings/',\n",
       "  'Don Gummer (born December 12, 1946) is an American sculptor. His early work concentrated on table-top and wall-mounted sculpture. In the mid-1980s, he shifted his focus to large free-standing works, often in bronze. In the 1990s, he added a variety of other materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum and stained glass. His interest in large outdoor works also led him to an interest in public art. He is married to Meryl Streep, although they have been separated since 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Style ==\\nCritic Irving Sandler (writing in Art in America, January 2005) has noted that Gummer\\'s work is recognizably rooted in constructivism, but also writes that \"in extending and deflecting Constructivist art in a new direction, Gummer has rendered it peculiarly contemporary.\" Sandler also writes that Gummer\\'s works \"give postmodern life to classic principles of abstract composition.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nGummer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on December 12, 1946, and grew up in Indiana. He is the son of Dorothy Ann (née Jacobson) and William Adolph Gummer, and has five brothers: William, Jack, Richard, Steven, and Mark.\\nHe studied at Ben Davis High School, Indianapolis, and then at the Herron School of Art from 1964 to 1966. From 1966 to 1970, he studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts, and then completed his studies at the Yale School of Art where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) and Master of Fine Arts (MFA), and studied with David von Schlegell.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nGummer\\'s first solo show was in 1973. Since then, his works have been featured at two dozen solo shows at museums and galleries around the East Coast and Midwest. His work has also been exhibited in group shows.\\nGummer\\'s commissioned works have included Primary Compass (2000), a site-specific outdoor permanent sculpture at the Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio, and a sculpture/fountain in Historic New Harmony, New Harmony, Indiana.  The Optimist” by Don Gummer was placed at the entrance of the Preston Arts Center, formerly the Henderson Fine Arts Center, on September 30, 2001, in Henderson, Kentucky. The sculpture made of cast stainless steel with a bronze base measures 7 ft. high, 4 ft. deep and 5 ft. in width and is mounted on a six-ton Indiana limestone base. “Fear and hate are no match for love and optimism” . . . Don Gummer . . . from speech at dedication and unveiling ceremony. One stainless steel and stained glass sculpture, Southern Circle, standing 25 feet (7.6 m) tall and weighing approximately 20,000 pounds, was commissioned by the city of Indianapolis and dedicated in October, 2004. \"Primary Separation\", a permanent installation at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, was completed in 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGummer married Peggy Jenel Lucas in the early seventies but divorced shortly after.\\nHe married actress Meryl Streep on September 30, 1978. They have four children: musician Henry Wolfe, and actresses Mamie, Grace, and  Louisa. It was reported in October 2023 that Gummer and Streep had been separated for more than six years.

       "  'Jeremy Henderson was an Anglo-Irish artist and painter. Henderson was Artist in Residence at Kingston University, with art exhibited at the Royal Academy and National Art Collections.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nJeremy Henderson was born at Lisbellaw, County Fermanagh, on 25 December 1952, to James Douglas Alexander Henderson, who managed the family business of Henderson & Eadie, and Doris Josephine née Watson. He attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, where the art master, Angus Bryson, spotted Henderson as an exceptional student.\\nFrom 1972 to 1973 Henderson studied an Arts Foundation course at Ulster University. From 1973 to 1976 he studied Fine art at Kingston University, London, achieving a Bachelor of Arts first class honours degree under the tutelage of Terry Jones, returning in 1977 as Artist in Residence. In the same year he became the first recipient of the Stanley Picker Fellowship Award in Painting. Between 1978 and 1979 Henderson completed a MA postgraduate in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art under the tutelage of the artist John Hoyland.\\nIn 1980 Henderson started his professional artistic journey, developing abstract techniques, creating large canvases with complex layers of overlaid and inter-worked paint. Henderson lived and painted in London for 20 years before relocating back to Ireland. In the mid-1980s he worked in a studio adjacent to the house he shared with his partner, Jenni Stone with whom he had a daughter named Emerald.\\nIn 1990 Henderson moved to the Cooperage Studio, Brick Lane, London, sharing the top floor with sculptor David Fusco and artist Bryan Benge, a friend from Kingston University. Benge says \"Every Summer the studios in the East End became part of the open studios programme.  . . . . He was an intelligent and incredibly accomplished Painter\". It was here, separated from his partner and virtually penniless, he devoted himself entirely to his work, living in a tent, donated by Benge\\'s parents, inside the studio .\\nHenderson was married once: in 1995 to the actress Patricia Martinelli with whom he subsequently had a daughter in 1997, Bella-Lucia. Henderson remained married, living in the remote village of Boho in Northern Ireland until his death, brought on by a brain tumour, on 28 April 2009. He remained a prolific artist throughout his life.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nIn 1975 Henderson exhibited for Stowells Trophy at the Royal Academy. Two years later, in 1977, Henderson became Artist in Residence at Kingston University.\\nDuring the mid-1980s Henderson\\'s work became recognised by private and public collectors, including Bono, leader of the Irish rock band U2. During this period Henderson sold his first work to the National Art Collection (1986). \\'Cuilcagh Under A Renaissance Sky\\' was purchased for Fermanagh County Museum with a grant from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland during his first solo exhibition \"Around a Border\" in Ireland. This was followed by 3 more acquisitions via the Arts Council during the 1980s, who have continued to support his work into the new millennium acquiring \"If Hobbema had Seen Ireland\" (1989) in 2004 via Art Fund with support from the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation. His work is exhibited by Arts Council England\\nHenderson began \"Palinurus in Soho\" in 1991, a series of 12 paintings depicting night time rooftop scenes across London, painted from an attic in Kingly Street. Exhibited at the Anna Bornholt Gallery in 1992, ten of the series were acquired by a single private collector.\\nAround 2000 Henderson became more influenced by Greek and Irish symbolism, in particular White Island, the Book of Kells and Sheela na gig, reflected in much of the art produced from this time onward. In 2001 Henderson created a set of enamel Manuscripts for the William Jefferson Clinton Centre in Enniskillen. Henderson was interested in enamelling because of the possibilities that it offered to him as a colourist and in the behaviour of gestural mark-making. The process was made possible when he was introduced to Andrew Morley, the authority on enamel sign making.\\nHenderson\\'s work is held in the private collection of the entrepreneur Vincent Ferguson, owner of Fitzwilton Plc and Independent News & Media PLC. His work held in the Smurfit Art Collection of Smurfit Kappa Group.\\nExhibitions & Awards for Henderson\\'s work include; The Royal Academy, Stowells Trophy-1975, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London-New Contemporaries, Artscribe Prize-1978, Whitworth Gallery, Manchester, Northern Young Contemporaries, Semper Idem, Tandava Stasis-1979, Round House Gallery, London, A Sense of Ireland-1980, Fenderesky, Belfast-\"Paintings Across a Border\"[solo]-1986, Arts Council Gallery, Belfast-\"Present Memories\"-1987, Hendricks Gallery-Dublin-Present Memories-1987, Fenderesky, Belfast-\"Landscape Now\"-1987, Art Advice/Hendriks International Gallery-New York-\"New Art from Ireland\" & \"Landscapes from Ireland\"-1988, Atlantis Gallery, London-\"Hill of History\"-1994\\n\\n\\n== Description of Work ==\\nHenderson\\'s painting style transitioned greatly from his early days favouring the mediums of Oil on Canvas; Oil on Paper; Watercolour; Gouache; Charcoal; Acrylic; Vitreous Enamel, using calligraphy in much of his work. His early vividly coloured geometric patterns were in the abstract contemporary style of the period. From the early 1980s his style developed into lyrical abstraction. Later with the transition to landscape scenes, typically of the Irish borders and coast, many layers of paint are used to build depth into each picture. In reference to these paintings Henderson says, \"In my paintings the time of day is indeterminable, the weather changeable, something has happened or is about to happen\".\\nIn 1986 Ted Hickey, Keeper of Art at Ulster Museum wrote, \"To state the obvious these landscapes are not careful delineations of picturesque landscape; they are essentially emotional and concerned with ideas about the nature of art and intended to stimulate and provoke rather than reassure\". Liam Kelly critiques the 1987 Present Memories exhibition live of BBC Radio\\nIn Henderson\\'s 1989 work \\'If Hobbema Had seen Ireland\\', exhibited at Fenderesky Gallery 1994 \\'Paintings Exhibition\\' and subsequently acquired via Art UK, the style is compared to that of Meindert Hobbema, as reflected in the title and reviewed by Fermanagh County Museum Curator in the Art UK 2004 Review.\\nArtistic influences include: Hans Hoffmann, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and John Hoyland. Henderson, frequently associated with Samuel Beckett and Jack B Yeats was influenced by his homeland; his early environment, growing up around weaving, yarns and dyeing, the regions political turmoil, symbolism, and in later life his chronic illness, expressed in his more sombre paintings.\\nJohn Hutchinson, critic and director of the Douglas Hyde Gallery wrote in the Sunday Independent that Henderson\\'s paintings, \"\\'demonstrate the fruitfulness of the no man\\'s land between abstraction and representation\", and \"His images deliberately evoke the picturesque and romantic landscape conventions that originated in the late 18th century.....as well as the expressionist subjectivity of painters such as Jack B Yeats\". Due to Henderson\\'s disinterest in the commercialisation of his work he is sometimes referred to as Ireland\\'s Invisible Genius.\\nHenderson described the evolution of his work, after returning to Ireland in 1993, saying, \"Since returning to Ireland my work has become less concerned with resting landscape painting in a cultural context more appropriate to our times, but has come full circle towards an internalised organic abstraction which characterised my more intuitive approach until the early eighties\"\\n\\n\\n== Public Art ==\\nIn 2001 Henderson was commissioned by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland to create a set of enamel Manuscripts for the William Jefferson Clinton Centre in Enniskillen, inaugurated by President Bill Clinton in 2002, in commemoration of the Remembrance Day bombings of 1987.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJeremy Henderson Website\\nNational Irish Visual arts Library\\nNational Art Library – Victoria & Albert Museum – Jeremy Henderson\\nArt-UK\\nOffice of Public Works, From Past To Present: Art From Public Buildings 1815–2001\\nThe Impartial Reporter – Creative journey celebrates the life of Jeremy Henderson\\nThe Impartial Reporter – Death of talented painter mourned by art world\\nArtists in Britain Since 1945, David Buckman, Excerpt of Jeremy Henderson, page 718\\nNational Trust – Jeremy Henderson\\nWikiArt – JeremyHenderson\\nBBC Radio NI live interview with Jeremy Henderson at Present Memories exhibition 1987',\n",
       "  'Eric Fischl (born March 9, 1948) is an American painter, sculptor, printmaker, draughtsman and educator. He is known for his paintings depicting American suburbia from the 1970s and 1980s.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nFischl was born in New York City and grew up on suburban Long Island; his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1967. His art education began at Phoenix College for two years, followed with studying at Arizona State University. Followed by studying at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California, where he received a B.F.A. in 1972. He then moved to Chicago, taking a job as a guard at the Museum of Contemporary Art.\\nBetween 1974 and 1978 he taught at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was at this school where he met his future wife, painter April Gornik. In 1978, he moved back to New York City.\\nFischl is a trustee and senior critic at the New York Academy of Art and President of the Academy of the Arts at Guild Hall of East Hampton. In addition to receiving Guild Hall\\'s Academy of the Art\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, Fischl was extended the honor of membership to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n \\nFischl has embraced the description of himself as a painter of the suburbs, not generally considered appropriate subject matter prior to his generation. Some of Fischl\\'s earlier works have a theme of adolescent sexuality and voyeurism, such as Sleepwalker (1979) which depicts an adolescent boy masturbating into a children\\'s pool. Bad Boy (1981) and Birthday Boy (1983) both depict young boys looking at older women shown in provocative poses on a bed. In Bad Boy, the subject is surreptitiously slipping his hand into a purse. In Birthday Boy, the child is depicted naked on the bed.\\nIn 2002, Fischl collaborated with the Museum Haus Esters in Krefeld, Germany. Haus Esters is a 1928 home, designed by Mies van der Rohe in 1928 to be a private home. It now houses changing exhibitions. Fischl refurbished it as a home (though not particularly in Bauhaus style) and hired models who, for several days, pretended to be a couple who lived there. He took 2,000 photographs, which he reworked digitally and used as the basis for a series of paintings, one of which, the monumental Krefeld Redux, Bedroom #6 (Surviving the Fall Meant Using You for Handholds) (2004) was purchased by Paul Allen featured in the 2006 Double Take Exhibit at Experience Music Project, where it was juxtaposed with a much smaller Degas pastel. This is by no means the first time Fischl has been compared to Degas.\\nTwenty years earlier, reviewing a show of 28 Fischl paintings at New York\\'s Whitney Museum, art critic John Russell wrote in The New York Times, \"[Degas] sets up a charged situation with his incomparable subtlety of insight and characterization, and then he goes away and leaves us to figure it out as best we can. That is the tactic of Fischl, too, though the society with which he deals has an unstructured brutality and a violence never far from release that are very different from the nicely calibrated cruelties that Degas recorded.\"\\nFischl also collaborated with Jamaica Kincaid, E. L. Doctorow and Frederic Tuten combining paintings and sketches with literary works. Composer Bruce Wolosoff was inspired by Fischl\\'s watercolors to compose \"The Loom\" for the classical ensemble Eroica Trio.\\nFischl\\'s work can be found in the permanent collections of museums such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; Art Institute of Chicago; Broad Museum, Los Angeles; Dallas Museum of Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C.; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek; Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Philadelphia Museum of Modern Art, among many others.\\nIn May 2022, a new auction record was set for Eric Fischl when his 1982 painting The Old Man\\'s Boat and the Old Man\\'s Dog sold for $4,140,000 against an estimate of $2,000,000-3,000,000, more than doubling his previous record.\\nEric Fischl is represented by Skarstedt Gallery, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nFor many years Fischl worked and resided in New York City, with his studio located in Tribeca. In 2000 he moved to Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York with his wife, landscapist April Gornik, where they share a home and matching studios.\\nIn Sag Harbor Fischl and Gornik led fundraising efforts to renovate the Sag Harbor Cinema which burned in December 2016 into a cultural center and renovate an abandoned Methodist Church into an artist residency and exhibition space called The Church.  Both venues opened in 2021.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nDanto, A. C., Enright, R., and Martin, S. (2008). Eric Fischl, 1970-2007. New York: Monacelli Press.',\n",
       "  'Nancy Goldin (born September 12, 1953) is an American photographer and activist. Her work often explores LGBT subcultures, moments of intimacy, the HIV/AIDS crisis, and the opioid epidemic. Her most notable work is The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986). The monograph documents the post-Stonewall, gay subculture and includes Goldin\\'s family and friends. She is a founding member of the advocacy group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now). She lives and works in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nGoldin was born in Washington, D.C. in 1953 to middle-class Jewish parents, and grew up in the Boston suburb of Swampscott, moving to Lexington in her teens. Goldin\\'s father worked in broadcasting and served as the chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission. Goldin had early exposure to tense family relationships, sexuality, and suicide, as her parents often argued about Goldin\\'s older sister Barbara who ultimately died by suicide when Goldin was 11:This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early sixties, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behavior, beyond control. By the time she was eighteen, she saw that her only way to get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will.Goldin began to smoke marijuana and date an older man. She left home by age 13 or 14 and subsequently lived in various foster homes. At 16 she enrolled at the Satya Community School in Lincoln, MA. A Satya staff member (existential psychologist Rollo May\\'s daughter) introduced Goldin to the camera in 1969 when she was sixteen years old. Still struggling from her sister\\'s death, Goldin used the camera and photography to cherish her relationships with those she photographed. She also found the camera as a useful political tool, to inform the public about important issues silenced in America. Her early influences included Andy Warhol\\'s early films, Federico Fellini, Jack Smith, French and Italian Vogue, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nGoldin\\'s first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city\\'s gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend David Armstrong. While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin \"fell in with the drag queens,\" living with them and photographing them. Among her work from this period is Ivy wearing a fall, Boston (1973). Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, \"My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can re-create themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it\\'s brave\".\\nGoldin admitted to being romantically in love with a queen during this period of her life in a Q&A with Bomb \"I remember going through a psychology book trying to find something about it when I was nineteen. There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so ... I don\\'t know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that\\'s where I was at that time in my life\".\\nGoldin describes her life as having been completely immersed in that of the queens. \"I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did – that\\'s who I was all the time. And that\\'s who I wanted to be\". However, upon attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, when her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with Cibachrome prints. Her work from this period is associated with the Boston School of Photography.\\nFollowing graduation, Goldin moved to New York City. She began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene, along with the city\\'s vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her slideshow The Ballad of Sexual Dependency—a title taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht\\'s Threepenny Opera. Later published as a book with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these snapshot aesthetic images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. In her foreword to the book she describes it as a \"diary [she] lets people read\" of people she referred to as her \"tribe\". Part of Ballad was driven by the need to remember her extended family. Photography was a way for her to hold onto her friends, she hoped.\\nThe photographs show a transition through Goldin\\'s travels and her life. Most of her Ballad subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to drug overdose or AIDS; this tally included close friends and often-photographed subjects Greer Lankton and Cookie Mueller. In 2003, The New York Times nodded to the work\\'s impact, explaining Goldin had \"forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years.\" In addition to Ballad, she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: I\\'ll Be Your Mirror and All By Myself.\\nGoldin\\'s work is most often presented in the form of a slideshow, and has been shown at film festivals; her most famous being a 45-minute show in which 800 pictures are displayed. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. In the book Auto-Focus, her photographs are described as a way to \"learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her\". The book speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling and references one of Goldin\\'s photographs \"Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984\" as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life.\\nGoldin\\'s work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: collaborative book projects with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki; New York City skylines; uncanny landscapes (notably of people in water); her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life.\\nIn 2000, her hand was injured and she currently retains less ability to turn it than in the past.\\n\\nIn 2006, her exhibition, Chasing a Ghost, opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation Sisters, Saints, & Sybils. The work involved her sister Barbara\\'s suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films.\\nAfter some time, her photos moved from portrayals of dangerous youthful abandonment to scenes of parenthood and family life in progressively worldwide settings. Goldin currently resides and works in New York, Paris, as well as London.\\n\\n\\n== Fashion ==\\nGoldin has undertaken commercial fashion photography—for Australian label Scanlan & Theodore\\'s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign, shot with model Erin Wasson; for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta\\'s Spring/Summer 2010 campaign with models Sean O\\'Pry and Anya Kazakova, evoking memories of her Ballad of Sexual Dependency; for shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2011 with model Linda Vojtova; and for Dior in 2013, 1000 LIVES, featuring Robert Pattinson.\\nIn March 2018, clothing brand Supreme released a collaborative range with Goldin as part of their Spring/Summer 2018 collection. This consisted of jackets, sweatshirts and t-shirts in various colors, with designs titled \"Misty and Jimmy Paulette\", \"Kim in Rhinestone\" and \"Nan as a dominatrix\".\\n\\n\\n== Activism ==\\n\\nIn 2017, in a speech in Brazil, Goldin revealed she was recovering from opioid addiction, specifically to OxyContin, after being prescribed the drug after wrist surgery. She had sought treatment for her addiction and battled through rehab. This led to her setting up a campaign called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (P.A.I.N.) pursuing social media activism directed against the Sackler family for their involvement in Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of OxyContin. Goldin has said the campaign attempts to contrast the philanthropic contributions of the Sackler family to art galleries, museums and universities with a lack of responsibility taken for the opioid crisis. Goldin became aware of the Sackler family in 2017.\\nIn 2018, she organized a protest in the Sackler Wing\\'s Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The protest called for museums and other cultural institutions not to accept money from the Sackler family.\\n\\nAlso in 2018, she was one of several artists who participated in a $100 sale organized by Magnum Photos and Aperture to raise funds for Goldin\\'s opioid awareness group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now).\"I\\'ve started a group called P.A.I.N. to address the opioid crisis. We are a group of artists, activists and addicts that believe in direct action. We target the Sackler family, who manufactured and pushed OxyContin, through the museums and universities that carry their name. We speak for the 250,000 bodies that no longer can.\"In February 2019, Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim Museum in New York over its acceptance of funding by the Sackler family.\\nShe also said that she would withdraw from a retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Portrait Gallery in London if they did not turn down a gift of £1 million from the Sacklers. The gallery subsequently said it would not proceed with the donation.\\nTwo days after the National Portrait Gallery statement, the Tate group of British art galleries (Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool) announced it would no longer accept any gifts offered by members of the Sackler family, from whom it had received £4m. Tate Modern had been planning to display its copy of Goldin\\'s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency slideshow, for a year from April 15, 2019. Goldin had not discussed the show with Tate.\\nGoldin identified that Tate, which has received Sackler money, paid her for one of the ten copies of The Ballad of Sexual Dependency in 2015, when she was deeply addicted to OxyContin. She says she spent some of the money on buying black market OxyContin, as doctors would no longer prescribe her the drug.\\nIn July 2019, Goldin and others from the group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a protest in the fountain at the Louvre in Paris. The protest was to try to persuade the museum to change the name of its Sackler wing, which is made up of 12 rooms.\\nIn November 2019, Goldin campaigned at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\\nSome critics have accused Goldin of making heroin use appear glamorous and of pioneering a grunge style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as The Face and I-D. However, in a 2002 interview with The Observer, Goldin herself called the use of \"heroin chic\" to sell clothes and perfumes \"reprehensible and evil.\" Goldin admits to having a romanticized image of drug culture at a young age, but she soon saw the error in this ideal: \"I had a totally romantic notion of being a junkie. I wanted to be one.\" Goldin\\'s substance usage stopped after she became intrigued with the idea of memory in her work, \"When people talk about the immediacy in my work, that\\'s what its about: this need to remember and record every single thing\"\\nGoldin\\'s interest in drugs stemmed from a sort of rebellion against parental guidance that parallels her decision to run away from home at a young age, \"I wanted to get high from a really early age. I wanted to be a junkie. That\\'s what intrigues me. Part was the Velvet Underground and the Beats and all that stuff. But, really, I wanted to be as different from my mother as I could and define myself as far as possible from the suburban life I was brought up in.\"\\nGoldin denies the role of voyeur; she is instead a queer insider sharing the same experiences as her subjects: \"I\\'m not crashing; this is my party. This is my family, my history.\" She insists her subjects have veto power over what she exhibits. In Fantastic Tales Liz Kotz criticizes Goldin\\'s claim that she is just as much a part of what she is photographing rather than exploiting her subjects. Goldin\\'s insistence on intimacy between artist and subject is an attempt to relegitimize the codes and conventions of social documentary, presumably by ridding them of their problematic enmeshment with the histories of social surveillance and coercion, says Kotz. [Her] insider status does nothing to alter the way her pictures convert her audience into voyeurs.\\nGoldin\\'s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency critiques gender norms (\"clichés\" as she calls them) by highlighting the collective human desire to form connections regardless of the emotional or physical cost. Throughout Ballad, Goldin showcases some difficult moments for both herself and her friends, especially in relation to their codependency in search of genuine connection. Her friends are a diverse cast consisting of many non-conforming gender identities and sexualities; Goldin\\'s photography exposes many narratives that most would turn a blind eye to, such as the  intense intimacy and pain of same-sex relationships. The AIDS epidemic cost most of Goldin\\'s friends their lives, now preserved in time through the photos that she captured of them. Throughout this period of loss, the desire for connection was further perpetuated and Goldin and her remaining friend group found it essential to remain in close contact with one another. This constant desire for intimacy and connection highlights the similarities amongst people, despite their more obvious differences, emphasizing the societally upheld \"differences\" between men and women.\\nIn November 2023, during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, hundreds of members and supporters of Jewish Voice for Peace–New York City (JVP-NYC) took part in a sit-in protest in front of New York\\'s Statue of Liberty demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Goldin addressed the demonstration, saying, \"As long as the people of Gaza are screaming, we need to yell louder, no matter who attempts to silence us.\" Goldin also canceled a photo shoot with the New York Times Magazine due to concerns about the New York Times\\' reporting on the Gaza crisis, accusing the newspaper of complicity with Israel in its reporting and further questioning its handling of Palestinian perspectives.\\n\\n\\n=== Censorship ===\\nAn exhibition of Goldin\\'s work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature. The main reason was that some of the photographs contained children in bed with their parents, who are naked and caressing each other. In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography.\\nThe sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin\\'s work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nAugust Sander, Peter Hujar, Larry Clark, David Wojnarowicz, and Claude Cahun are all major influences to Goldin\\'s work. \\n\\n\\n=== Diane Arbus ===\\nBoth Goldin and Diane Arbus celebrate those who live marginal lives. Stills from Variety are compared to Arbus\\' magazine work; the Variety series portray \"the rich collision of music, club life, and art production of the Lower East Side pre and post AIDS period\". Both artists ask to reexamine artists\\' intentionality. \\n\\n\\n=== Michelangelo Antonioni ===\\nOne of the reasons Goldin began photographing was Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s Blow Up (1966). The sexuality and glamour of the film exerted a \"huge effect\" on her. Referring to images shown in Ballad, \"the beaten down and beaten up personages, with their gritty, disheveled miens, which populate these early pictures, often photographed in the dark and dank, ramshackle interiors, relate physically and emotionally to the alienated and marginal character types that attracted Antonioni.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Larry Clark ===\\nThe youths in Larry Clark\\'s Tulsa (1971) presented a striking contrast to any wholesome, down-home stereotype of the heartland that captured the collective American imagination. He turned the camera on himself and his lowlife amphetamine-shooting board of hanger-ons. Goldin would adopt Clark\\'s approach to image-making.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books by Goldin ===\\nThe Ballad of Sexual Dependency. New York: Aperture, 1986.

Artists represented included David Armstrong, Tom Chesley, Dorit Cypis, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Jane Dickson, Darrel Ellis, Allen Frame, Peter Hujar, Greer Lankton, Siobhan Liddel, Mark Morrisroe, James Nares, Perico Pastor, Margo Pelletier, Clarence Elie-Rivera, Vittorio Scarpati, Jo Shane, Kiki Smith, Janet Stein, Stephen Tashjian, Shellburne Thurber, Ken Tisa, and David Wojnarowicz. Goldin noted that artists\\' works varied in response, as \"out of loss comes memory pieces, tributes to friends and lovers who have died; out of anger comes explorations of the political cause and effects of the disease.\"\\nDavid Wojnarowicz\\'s essay \"Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell\" in the exhibition\\'s catalogue criticized conservative legislation that Wojnarowicz believed would increase the spread of HIV by discouraging safe sex education. Additionally, Wojnarowicz speaks about the efficacy of making the private public via the model of outing, as he and Goldin believed empowerment begins through self-disclosure. Embracing personal identities then becomes a political statement that disrupts oppressive rules of behavior of bourgeois society – though Wojnarowicz does admit outing may lock a subject into a single frozen identity. Goldin\\'s show, and in particular Wojnarowicz\\'s essay, was met with criticism, leading to the National Endowment of Arts rescinding its support for the publication.\\n\\n\\n=== From Desire: A Queer Diary ===\\nGoldin\\'s second curated show, From Desire: A Queer Diary (March 29 – April 19, 1991), was held at the Richard F.

       "  'Candida Höfer (born 4 February 1944) is a German photographer. She is a renowned photographer known for her exploration of public spaces and architecture. In her career she transitioned from portraiture to focusing on spaces like libraries and museums. She is a former student of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Like other Becher students, Höfer\\'s work is known for technical perfection and a strictly conceptual approach. Her work explores the ways in which institutional architecture shapes and directs human experience. Höfer\\'s technical approach is reflective of her goals as an artist.\\nFrom 1997 to 2000, she taught as professor at the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Karlsruhe. Höfer is the recipient of the 2018 Outstanding Contribution to Photography award, as part of the Sony World Photography Awards. She is based in Cologne.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCandida Höfer was born in 1944 in Eberswalde, Province of Brandenburg. Höfer is a daughter of the German journalist Werner Höfer. From 1964 to 1968 Höfer studied at the Kölner Werkschulen (Cologne Academy of Fine and Applied Arts). After graduation, she began working for newspapers as a portrait photographer, producing a series on Liverpudlian poets. From 1970 to 1972, she studied daguerreotypes while working as an assistant to Werner Bokelberg in Hamburg. She later attended the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1973 to 1982, where she studied film under Ole John and, from 1976, photography under Bernd Becher. Along with Thomas Ruff, she was one of the first of Becher\\'s students to use color, showing her work as slide projections. While at school, she conceived a film she shot jointly with Tony Morgan in the Düsseldorf ice cream parlour Da Forno in 1975.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nHöfer initially worked with black-and-white photography, such as with Flipper (1973), a large photo-collage consisting of 47 gelatin silver prints. The images all depict pinball machines in arcades and pubs, sometimes seen with players and sometimes by themselves. Shortly afterwards, she began working on her \\'Türken in Deutschland\\' (Turks in Germany) series (1973–1979), which follows Turkish migrant families in their new German homes. It was during this period that Höfer became interested in color, as she felt it suited her works better, and in interior spaces and their impact on the people who inhabit them and vice versa.\\nHöfer began taking color photographs of interiors of public buildings, such as offices, banks, and waiting rooms, in 1979. Her breakthrough to fame came with a series of photographs showing guest workers in Germany, after which she concentrated on the subjects Interiors, Rooms and Zoological Gardens. Höfer specializes in large-format photographs of empty interiors and social spaces that capture the \"psychology of social architecture\". Her photographs are taken from a classic straight-on frontal angle or seek a diagonal in the composition. She tends to shoot each actionless room from an elevated vantage point near one wall so that the far wall is centered within the resulting image. From her earliest creations, she has been interested in representing public spaces such as museums, libraries, national archives or opera houses devoid of all human presence. Höfer\\'s imagery has consistently focused on these depopulated interiors since the 1980s. Höfer groups her photographs into series that have institutional themes as well as geographical ones, but the formal similarity among her images is their dominant organizing principle.\\nIn her Zoologische Gärten series (1991), Höfer shifted her focus away from interiors to zoos in Germany, Spain, England, France and the Netherlands. Implementing her typically descriptive style, Höfer\\'s images again seek to deconstruct the role institutions play in defining the viewer\\'s gaze by documenting animals in their caged environments.\\nIn 2001, for Douze-Twelve, commissioned by the Musée des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle in Calais and later shown at Documenta 11, Höfer photographed all 12 casts of Auguste Rodin\\'s The Burghers of Calais in their installations in various museums and sculpture gardens. From 2004 to 2007, she traveled the world to photograph conceptual artist On Kawara\\'s iconic Date Paintings in the homes of private collectors. In 2005, Höfer embarked upon a project at the Musée du Louvre, documenting its various galleries, examining not only the sacred art they exhibit but also their individual design, arches, tiles and embellishments, with spectators and tourists entirely absent.\\n\\n\\n== Interpretation in Institutional Photography ==\\nCandida Höfer\\'s photography, particularly her Libraries series, extends beyond architectural documentation to provide a detailed examination of institutional culture. The works parallel Sharon Macdonald\\'s ethnographic study of the Science Museum in London. Höfer\\'s images, marked by the absence of human presence, enable viewers to focus on the undisturbed tranquility and vibrant colors of spaces such as the British Library and the Whitney Museum. This \"architecture of absence\" draws attention to the unseen labor and institutional decisions that shape visitor experiences. Her large-scale photographs capture the essence of library spaces, emphasizing architectural beauty, intricate interior details, and the interplay of light and shadow. Höfer\\'s precise use of symmetry and composition enhances the visual impact and documents the cultural and historical significance of these spaces. By highlighting architectural elements and institutional structures, her work reveals the complex interplay between architecture, institutional directives, and cultural representation. Höfer\\'s focus on textures and materials adds a tactile dimension, intending to encourage viewers to imagine the physical sensations of these grand spaces. Some readings of her work adopt a ethnographic and thematic organization enhancing an understanding of how institutional spaces are designed and experienced, exploring the social architecture and cultural narratives inherent within these environments.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHöfer\\'s first solo exhibition was in 1975 at the Konrad Fischer Galerie in Düsseldorf. Since then, Höfer has had solo exhibitions in museums throughout Europe and the United States, including the Centro de Fotografía at the Universidad de Salamanca, the Galerie de l’École des Beaux-Arts in Valenciennes, the Kunsthalle Bremen, the Louvre, the Kunsthalle Nürnberg, the Kunsthaus Hamburg, the Museum of Contemporary Photography (MoCP)), the Museum Folkwang, and the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn She has also had an exhibition at the Portikus in Frankfurt am Main. She was apart of the \"German Photography: Documentation and Introspection\" at Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in 1990 as one of nine artists highlighted. In 2001 she was apart of \"Minimalismos: Un Signo de los Tiempos\" at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. She was included by Okwui Enwezor in Documenta 11 in Kassel in 2002. In 2003 the artist represented Germany with the late Martin Kippenberger in the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, which was curated by Julian Heynen. The first comprehensive North American survey of her work was shown under the title Architecture of Absence at Norton Museum of Art in 2006. That same year, she had a solo exhibition at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. She is currently represented by Sean Kelly Gallery and Kotaro Nukaga in Japan.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nThe highest price reached by one of her photographs was when Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra IV (2006) sold by £80,500 ($121,233) at Christie\\'s London, on 12 February 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nHöfer lives and works in Cologne.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2018: Outstanding Contribution to Photography award, Sony World Photography Awards\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHöfer\\'s work is held in the following permanent public collections:\\n\\nJewish Museum, New York\\nSolomon R.

       "  'Ellsworth Kelly (May 31, 1923 – December 27, 2015) was an American painter, sculptor, and printmaker associated with hard-edge painting, Color field painting and minimalism. His works demonstrate unassuming techniques emphasizing line, color and form, similar to the work of John McLaughlin and Kenneth Noland. Kelly often employed bright colors. He lived and worked in Spencertown, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Childhood ==\\nKelly was born the second son of three to Allan Howe Kelly and Florence Rose Elizabeth (Githens) Kelly in Newburgh, New York, approximately 60 miles north of New York City. His father was an insurance company executive of Scots-Irish and German descent. His mother was a former schoolteacher of Welsh and Pennsylvania German stock. His family moved from Newburgh to Oradell, New Jersey, a town of nearly 7,500 people. His family lived near the Oradell Reservoir, where his paternal grandmother introduced him to ornithology when he was eight or nine years old.\\nThere he developed his passion for form and color. John James Audubon had a particularly strong influence on Kelly\\'s work throughout his career. Author Eugene Goossen speculated that the two- and three-color paintings (such as Three Panels: Red Yellow Blue, I 1963) for which Kelly is so well known can be traced to his bird watching and his study of the two- and three-color birds he saw so frequently at an early age. Kelly said he was often alone as a young boy and became somewhat of a \"loner.\" He had a slight stutter that persisted into his teenage years.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nKelly attended public school, where art classes stressed materials and sought to develop the \"artistic imagination.\" This curriculum was typical of the broader trend in schooling that had emerged from the Progressive education theories promulgated by the Columbia University\\'s Teacher\\'s College, at which the American modernist painter Arthur Wesley Dow had taught. Although his parents were reluctant to support Kelly\\'s art training, his school teacher, Dorothy Lange Opsut, encouraged him to go further. As his parents would pay only for technical training, Kelly studied first at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, which he attended from 1941 until he was inducted into the Army on New Year\\'s Day 1943.\\n\\n\\n== Military ==\\nUpon entering the U.S military service in 1943 Kelly requested to be assigned to the 603rd Engineers Camouflage Battalion, which took many artists. He was inducted at Fort Dix, New Jersey and sent to Camp Hale, Colorado, where he trained with mountain ski troops. He had never skied before. Six to eight weeks later, he was transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland. During World War II, he served with other artists and designers in the Ghost Army, a United States Army deception unit that used inflatable tanks, trucks and other elements of subterfuge to mislead the Axis forces about the direction and disposition of Allied forces. His exposure to military camouflage during the time he served became part of his basic art training. Kelly served with the unit from 1943 until the end of the European phase of the war. The Ghost Army received the Congressional Gold Medal on March 21, 2024, at a ceremony in Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\n\\n== Postwar education ==\\nKelly used the G.I. Bill to study from 1946–47 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he took advantage of the museum\\'s collections, and then at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While in Boston, he exhibited in his first group show at the Boris Mirski Gallery and taught art classes at the Norfolk House Center in Roxbury. While in Paris, Kelly established his aesthetic. He attended classes infrequently, but immersed himself in the rich artistic resources of the French capital. He had heard a lecture by Max Beckmann on the French artist Paul Cézanne in 1948 and moved to Paris that year. There he encountered fellow Americans John Cage and Merce Cunningham, experimenting in music and dance, respectively; the French Surrealist artist Jean Arp; and the abstract sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, whose simplification of natural forms had a lasting effect on him. The experience of visiting artists such as Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, Alberto Giacometti and Georges Vantongerloo in their studios was transformative.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter being abroad for six years Kelly\\'s French was still poor and he had sold only one painting. In 1953 he was evicted from his studio and he returned to America the following year.\\n He had become interested after reading a review of an Ad Reinhardt exhibit, an artist whose work he felt his work related to. Upon his return to New York, he found the art world \"very tough.\" Although Kelly is now considered an essential innovator and contributor to the American art movement, it was hard for many to find the connection between Kelly\\'s art and the dominant stylistic trends. In May 1956 Kelly had his first New York City exhibition at Betty Parsons\\' gallery. His art was considered more European than was popular in New York at the time. He showed again at her gallery in the fall of 1957. Three of his pieces: Atlantic, Bar, and Painting in Three Panels, were selected for and shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art\\'s exhibit, \"Young America 1957\". His pieces were considered radically different from the other twenty-nine artists’ works. Painting in Three Panels, for example, was particularly noted; at the time critics questioned his creating a work from three canvases. For instance, Michael Plante said that, more often than not, Kelly\\'s multiple-panel pieces were cramped because of installation restrictions, which reduced the interaction between the pieces and the architecture of the room.\\nKelly eventually moved away from Coenties Slip, where he had sometimes shared a studio with fellow artist and friend Agnes Martin, to the ninth floor of the high-rise studio/co-op Hotel des Artistes at 27 West 67th Street.\\nKelly left New York City for Spencertown in 1970 and was joined there by his partner, photographer Jack Shear, in 1984. From 2001 until his death Kelly worked in a 20,000-square-feet studio in Spencertown reconfigured and extended by the architect Richard Gluckman; the original studio had been designed by Schenectady-based architects Werner Feibes and James Schmitt in exchange for a site-specific painting Kelly created for them. Kelly and Shear moved in 2005 to the residence they shared until the painter\\'s death, a wood-clad Colonial house built around 1815. Shear serves as the director of the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation. In 2015, Kelly gifted his building design concept for a site of contemplation to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas in Austin. Titled Austin, the 2,715-square-foot stone building—which features colored glass windows, a totemic wood sculpture and black-and-white marble panels—is the only building Kelly designed and is his most monumental work. Austin, which Kelly designed thirty years prior, opened in February 2018.\\nKelly died in Spencertown, New York on December 27, 2015, aged 92.\\n\\n\\n=== Painting ===\\nWhile in Paris, Kelly had continued to paint the figure but by May 1949, he made his first abstract paintings. Observing how light dispersed on the surface of water, he painted Seine (1950), made of black and white rectangles arranged by chance. In 1951 he started a series of eight collages titled Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance I to VIII. He created it by using numbered slips of paper; each referred to a colour, one of eighteen different hues to be placed on a grid 40 inches by 40 inches. Each of the eight collages employed a different process.\\n\\nKelly\\'s discovery in 1952 of Monet\\'s late work infused him with a new freedom of painterly expression: he began working in extremely large formats and explored the concepts of seriality and monochrome paintings. As a painter he worked from then on in an exclusively abstract mode. By the late 1950s, his painting stressed shape and planar masses (often assuming non-rectilinear formats). His work of this period also provided a useful bridge from the vanguard American geometric abstraction of the 1930s and early 1940s to the minimalism and reductive art of the mid-1960s and 1970s. Kelly\\'s relief painting Blue Tablet (1962), for example, was included in the seminal 1963 exhibition, Toward a New Abstraction, at the Jewish Museum.\\nDuring the 1960s he started working with irregularly angled canvases. Yellow Piece (1966), the artist\\'s first shaped canvas, represents Kelly\\'s pivotal break with the rectangular support and his redefinition of painting\\'s figure/ground relationship. With its curved corners and single, all-encompassing color, the canvas itself becomes the composition, transforming the wall behind it into the picture\\'s ground.\\n\\nIn the 1970s he added curved shapes to his repertoire. Green White (1968) marks the debut appearance of the triangle in Kelly\\'s oeuvre, a shape that reoccurs throughout his career; the painting is composed of two distinct, shaped monochromatic canvases, which are installed on top of each other: a large-scale, inverted, green trapezoid is positioned vertically above a smaller white triangle, forming a new geometric\\ncomposition.\\nAfter leaving New York City for Spencertown in 1970, he rented a former theater in the nearby town of Chatham, allowing to work in a studio more spacious than any he had previously occupied. After working there for a year, Kelly embarked on a series of 14 paintings that would become the Chatham Series. Each work takes the form of an inverted ell, and is made of two joined canvases, each canvas a monochrome of a different color. The works vary in proportion and palette from one to the next; careful attention was paid to the size of each panel and the color selected in order to achieve balance and contrast between the two.\\nA larger series of twelve works which Kelly started in 1972 and did not complete until 1983, Gray was originally conceived as an anti-war statement and is drained of color. In 1979 he used curves in two-colour paintings made of separate panels.\\nIn later paintings, Kelly distilled his palette and introduced new forms. In each work, he started with a rectangular canvas which he carefully painted with many coats of white paint; a shaped canvas, mostly painted black, is placed on top.\\nIn reference to his own work Kelly said in an interview in 1996: \"I think what we all want from art is a sense of fixity, a sense of opposing the chaos of daily living. This an illusion, of course. Canvas rots. Paint changes color. But you keep trying to freeze the world as if you could make it last forever. In a sense, what I\\'ve tried to capture is the reality of flux, to keep art an open, incomplete situation, to get at the rapture of seeing.\"\\nKelly commented \"I realized I didn\\'t want to compose pictures … I wanted to find them. I felt that my vision was choosing things out there in the world and presenting them. To me the investigation of perception was of the greatest interest. There was so much to see, and it all looked fantastic to me.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Lithographs and drawings ===\\nKelly tendered drawings of plants and flowers from the late 1940s on. Ailanthus (1948) is the first plant drawing that he executed in Boston, Hyacinth (1949) was the first one he did when he was in Paris. Beginning in 1949, while living in Paris (and influenced in this choice of subject by Henri Matisse and Jean Arp) he began to draw simple plant and seaweed forms. The plant studies are, for the most part, contour drawings of leaves, stems and flowers done in clean strokes of pencil or pen and centered on the page.\\nHe took up printmaking in a concerted fashion in the mid-1960s, when he produced his Suite of Twenty-Seven Lithographs (1964–66) with Maeght Éditeur in Paris. It was then that he created his first group of plant lithographs. From 1970 on he collaborated primarily with Gemini G.E.L. His initial series of 28 transfer lithographs, entitled Suite of Plant Lithographs, marked the beginning of a corpus that would grow to 72 prints and countless drawings of foliage. In 1971, he completed four editions of prints and an edition of the multiple Mirrored Concorde at Gemini G.E.L. His Purple/Red/Gray/Orange (1988), at eighteen feet in length, may be the largest single-sheet lithograph ever made. His recent editions, The River, States of the River and River II, reflect the fascination with water Kelly possessed since his early days in Paris. In 1975, Kelly was the first artist to exhibit for the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art\\'s MATRIX series. The exhibition displayed Kelly\\'s Corn Stalk drawings series and two of his 1974 cor-ten steel sculptures.\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\n\\nAlthough Kelly may be better known for his paintings, he also worked at sculpture throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived one of his first wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly\\'s casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child\\'s hobby horse with curving rocker supports.\\nIn 1973 Kelly began regularly making large-scale outdoor sculpture. Kelly gave up painted surfaces, instead choosing unvarnished steel, aluminum or bronze, often in totem-like configurations such as Curve XXIII (1981). While the totemic forms of his freestanding sculptures can measure up to 15 feet tall, his wall reliefs can span more than 14 feet wide. Kelly\\'s sculpture \"is founded on its adherence to absolute simplicity and clarity of form.\" For his 1980s sculptures, during this period of his time in Spencertown, the artist devoted for the first time as much energy to his sculptures as to his painting, and in the process producing over sixty percent of his total 140 sculptures.\\nKelly created his pieces using a succession of ideas on various forms. He might have begun with a drawing, enhanced the drawing to create a print, taken the print and created a freestanding piece, which was then made into a sculpture. His sculptures are meant to be entirely simple and can be viewed quickly, often only in one glance. The viewer observes smooth, flat surfaces that are secluded from the space that surrounds them. This sense of flatness and minimalism makes it hard to tell the difference between the foreground and background. Kelly\\'s Blue Disc was included in the seminal 1966 exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York entitled, Primary Structures, alongside many much younger artists just beginning to work with minimal forms.\\n\\n\\n=== Style ===\\nWilliam Rubin noted that \"Kelly\\'s development had been resolutely inner-directed: neither a reaction to Abstract Expressionism nor the outcome of a dialogue with his contemporaries.\" Many of his paintings consist of a single (usually bright) color, with some canvases being of irregular shape, sometimes called \"shaped canvases.\" The quality of line seen in his paintings and in the form of his shaped canvases is very subtle, and implies perfection. This is demonstrated in his piece Block Island Study (1959).\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nKelly\\'s background in the military has been suggested as a source of the seriousness of his works. While serving time in the army, Kelly was exposed to and influenced by the camouflage with which his specific battalion worked. This taught him about the use of form and shadow, as well as the construction and deconstruction of the visible. It was fundamental to his early education as an artist. Ralph Coburn, a friend of Kelly\\'s from Boston, introduced him to the technique of automatic drawing while visiting in Paris. Kelly embraced this technique of making an image without looking at the sheet of paper. These techniques helped Kelly in loosening his drawing style and broadened his acceptance of what he believed to be art. During his last year in Paris, Kelly was ill and also suffered depression; Sims thought that influenced his predominant use of black and white during that period.\\nKelly\\'s admiration for Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso are apparent in his work. He trained himself to view things in various ways and work in different mediums because of their inspiration. Piet Mondrian influenced the nonobjective forms he used in both his paintings and sculptures. Kelly was first influenced by the art and architecture of the Romanesque and Byzantine eras while he was studying in Paris. His introduction to Surrealism and Neo-Plasticism influenced his work and caused him to test the abstraction of geometric forms.\\n\\n\\n=== Curating ===\\nIn 2014 Kelly organized a show of Matisse drawings at the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum in South Hadley, Massachusetts. In 2015, he curated \"Monet/Kelly\" at the Clark Art Institute.\\nIn 1990 Kelly curated the exhibition, \"Artist\\'s Choice: Ellsworth Kelly Fragmentation and the Single Form,\" at the Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1956, he met Robert Indiana who moved in the same building and they became partners. Kelly became his mentor. They broke up around 1964. One of the reasons was Indiana\\'s use of words in his paintings and Kelly considered such technique not worthy of high art.\\nFrom 1984 until his death, Kelly lived with his husband, photographer Jack Shear, who serves as the director of the Ellsworth Kelly Foundation.\\n\\n\\n== Artworks (selection) ==\\n\\nRed Yellow Blue White and Black, Red Yellow Blue White and Black II 1953, oil on canvas, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago\\nWhite Disk, White Disk III 1961, oil paint on wood, Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago\\nWindow, Museum of Modern Art, Paris, 1949, oil and wood on canvas, Private Collection\\nSpectrum of Colors Arranged by Chance, 1951–53, oil on wood, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\\nBlack Ripe, 1955, oil on canvas, Collection of Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson\\nSculpture for a Large Wall, 1956–57, anodized aluminum, Museum of Modern Art, New York\\nRed Orange (Inca), 1959, oil on canvas, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford\\nRed Blue Green, 1963, oil on canvas, Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego\\nCurve IX, 1974, polished aluminum, Private Collection\\nHouston Triptych, 1986, bronze, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston\\nThree Panels: Orange, Dark Gray, Green, 1986, oil on canvas, Museum of Modern Art, New York\\nRed Curves, 1996, oil on canvas, Private Collection\\nHigh Yellow, 1960, oil on canvas, Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, TX\\nNine Squares 1976–77, oil on canvas, Collection of Tate\\n\"Spectrum VIII\" (2014), acrylic on canvas, 12 joined panels, Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris\\nAustin, 2015, structure, Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, TX\\nBarcelona houses sculptures of Ellsworth Kelly (1987).

His first solo show in New York was held at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1956. In 1957, he showed works in a group exhibition at the Ferus Gallery, Los Angeles. In 1959 he was included in the Museum of Modern Art\\'s ground-breaking exhibition, Sixteen Americans. Kelly was invited to show at the São Paulo Biennial in 1961. His work was later included in the documenta in 1964, 1968, 1977, 1992. A room of his paintings was included in the 2007 Venice Biennale.\\nKelly\\'s first retrospective was held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1973. His work has since been recognized in numerous retrospective exhibitions, including a sculpture exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in 1982; an exhibition of works on paper and a show of his print works that traveled extensively in the United States and Canada from 1987–88; and a career retrospective in 1996 organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Tate Gallery in London, and the Haus der Kunst in Munich. Since then, solo exhibitions of Kelly\\'s work have been mounted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1998), Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge (1999), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1988/2002), Philadelphia Museum of Art (2007), and Museum of Modern Art in New York (2007).\\nIn 1993 the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris mounted the exhibition \"Ellsworth Kelly: The French Years, 1948–54,\" based on the artist\\'s relationship with the city, which travelled to the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; in 2008, the Musée d\\'Orsay honored Kelly with the exhibition \"Correspondences: Paul Cézanne Ellsworth Kelly\". Haus der Kunst exhibited the first comprehensive retrospective of Kelly\\'s black and white works in 2012.\\nOn the occasion of the artist\\'s 90th birthday in 2013, the National Gallery of Art in Washington mounted an exhibition of his prints; the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia put together five sculptures in a show; the Phillips Collection in Washington exhibited his panel paintings; and the Museum of Modern Art opened a show of the \"Chatham Series\".\\nA retrospective entitled \"Ellsworth Kelly at 100\" was organized in 2023 by the Glenstone Museum in Potomac, Maryland, and was scheduled to travel to Paris and Doha.  \\n\\n\\n=== Selected solo exhibitions ===\\n1951  Kelly Peintures et reliefs, Galerie Arnaud, Paris\\n1956  Betty Parsons Gallery, New York\\n1957  Betty Parsons Gallery, New York\\n1957  Young America 1957, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York\\n1973  Ellsworth Kelly, Museum of Modern Art, New York\\n1977  Ellsworth Kelly: Paintings, Leo Castelli Gallery, New York\\n1982  Ellsworth Kelly: Sculpture, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York\\n1985  Ellsworth Kelly: White Panel II\", High Museum of Art, Atlanta\\n1987  Ellsworth Kelly: Works on Paper, Fort Worth Art Museum, Fort Worth\\n1994  Ellsworth Kelly: Recent Paintings, Matthew Marks Gallery, New York\\n1996  Ellsworth Kelly: A Retrospective, Guggenheim Museum, New York\\n2002  Ellsworth Kelly in San Francisco, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco\\n2003  Ellsworth Kelly: The Self-Portrait Drawings, 1944–1992, Matthew Marks Gallery, New York\\n2006  Ellsworth Kelly: New Paintings, Matthew Marks Gallery, New York\\n2010   Ellsworth Kelly: Drawings 1954–1962, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom\\n2012   Ellsworth Kelly: Schwarz und Weiss, Museum Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden\\n2014   Monet | Kelly, Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Massachusetts\\n\\n\\n== Public commissions ==\\n\\nIn 1957 Kelly was commissioned to produce a 65-foot-long wall sculpture for the Transportation Building at Penn Center in Philadelphia, his largest work to that date. Largely forgotten, the sculpture entitled Sculpture for a Large Wall (1957) was eventually dismantled. Kelly has since executed many public commissions, including Wright Curve (1966), a steel sculpture designed for permanent installation in the Guggenheim\\'s Peter B. Lewis Theater; a mural for the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in 1969; Curve XXII (I Will) at Lincoln Park in Chicago in 1981; a 1985 commission by I. M. Pei for the Raffles City building in Singapore; the Houston Triptych, vertical bronze planes mounted on a tall concrete at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, in 1986; Totem (1987), a sculpture for the Parc de la Creueta del Coll, Barcelona; the Dallas Panels (Blue Green Black Red) (1989) for the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas; a 1989 sculpture for the headquarters of Nestlé in Vevey, Switzerland; Gaul (1993), a monumental sculpture commissioned by the Institute d\\'Art Contemporain, Nîmes, France; a two-part memorial for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C., in 1993; and large-scale Berlin panels for the Deutscher Bundestag, Berlin, in 1998. For the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse (designed by Henry N. Cobb) in Boston he designed The Boston Panels, 21 brilliantly colored aluminum panels installed in the central rotunda as a single work throughout the building.\\nIn 2013 Ellsworth Kelly was commissioned the work \"Spectrum VIII\" (completed in 2014) a large-scale multi-panel painting serving as curtain for the Auditorium designed by Frank Gehry at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, Paris. See \"Ellsworth Kelly\", Francesca Pietropaolo ed., Cahiers de la Fondation, no.1, (Paris: Fondation Louis Vuitton, 2014).\\nKelly\\'s two-paneled Blue Black (2001), 28 feet tall and made of painted honeycomb aluminum, was commissioned for the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, St. Louis, and the large-scale bronze Untitled (2005) was commissioned specifically for the courtyard of the Phillips Collection. In 2005, Kelly was commissioned with the only site-specific work for the Modern wing of the Art Institute of Chicago by Renzo Piano. He created White Curve, the largest wall sculpture he has ever made, which is on display since 2009. Kelly installed Berlin Totem, a 40 feet stainless-steel sculpture, in the courtyard of the Embassy of the United States, Berlin, in 2008.\\nIn 1986 Kelly conceived his first free-standing building for a private collector, but it was never realized. Only in 2015, the Blanton Museum of Art acquired his design for a 2,715-square-foot stone building, including 14 black-and-white marble panels and colored glass windows, planning to build it on the museum\\'s grounds at the University of Texas, Austin. The building was opened to the public February 18, 2018. A work of art and architecture, Austin, is deemed the culmination of Kelly\\'s career.\\nKelly was commissioned to create a large outdoor sculpture in 1968 for the Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. The sculpture titled Yellow Blue was inspired by the Empire State Plaza setting, and is Kelly\\'s largest standing sculpture at nine feet high and nearly sixteen feet across. Yellow Blue was his first steel sculpture and remains the only one to date in painted steel.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nIn 1957 the Whitney Museum of American Art bought a painting, Atlantic, which depicted two white wave-like arcs against solid black; it was Kelly\\'s first museum purchase. Today, his work is in many public collections, including those of the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection, Albany, NY, The Hyde Collection, Glens Falls, NY, and Tate Modern, London. In 1999, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art announced that it had bought 22 works, paintings, wall reliefs and sculptures, by Ellsworth Kelly. They have been valued at more than $20 million. In 2003, the Menil Collection received Kelly\\'s Tablet, 188 framed works on paper, including sketches, working drawings and collages. Notable private collectors include, among others, Eli Broad and Gwyneth Paltrow.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\n1963: Brandeis Creative Arts Award, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts\\n1964: Carnegie International\\n1974: Member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters\\n1987: Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\\n1999: Edward MacDowell Medal\\n2000: Praemium Imperiale\\n2013: Brandeis University honorary doctorate of Humane Letters, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts\\n2013: National Medal of Arts, presented by the President of the United States\\nKelly has also received numerous honorary degrees, among others from Bard College (1996), Annandale-on-Hudson, New York; Royal College of Art, London (1997); Harvard University, Cambridge (2003); and Williams College (2005).\\n\\n\\n=== Kelly postage stamps ===\\nThe United States Postal Service announced in January, 2019, that a set of stamps honoring Kelly\\'s artwork would be issued in 2019. The USPS press release acknowledges Kelly\\'s pioneering of a \"distinctive style of abstraction based on real elements reduced to their essential forms.\" Ten works are represented, including Yellow White, Colors for a Large Wall, Blue Red Rocker, Spectrum I, South Ferry, Blue Green, Orange Red Relief (for Delphine Seyrig), Meschers, Red Blue and Gaza. The set of stamps were issued on May 31, 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nThe dealer Betty Parsons first offered him a solo exhibition in 1956. In 1965, after nearly a decade with Parsons, he began to show with the Sidney Janis Gallery. In the 1970s and 1980s, his work was handled jointly by Leo Castelli and Blum Helman in New York. In 1992, he joined the Matthew Marks Gallery, New York and Los Angeles, and the Anthony d’Offay Gallery in London. The facade of Marks\\'s Los Angeles gallery was inspired by Study for Black and White Panels, a collage he made while living in Paris in 1954, and a painting, Black Over White. From 1964 he produced prints and editioned sculptures at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles and Tyler Graphics Ltd near New York City.\\nIn 2014 Kelly\\'s painting Red Curve (1982) sold at auction for $4.5 million at Christie\\'s New York. That auction record for a work by Ellsworth Kelly was set by the 13-part painting Spectrum VI (1969), which sold for $5.2 million at Sotheby\\'s New York, Contemporary Art Evening sale, November 14, 2007.\\nIn Nov 2019, Christie\\'s set an auction record for the artist with the work Red Curve VII, sold for a $9.8million.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nAustin In Depth—official web pages at the Blanton Museum site\\nEllsworth Kelly at the Museum of Modern Art\\nEllsworth Kelly in St Ives exhibition at Tate St Ives, UK, 2006\\nEllsworth Kelly in \"Blue Green Black Red: The Dallas Panels\" on the north wall of the main lobby at the Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, Texas\\nBiography from the Museum of Modern Art, includes selected images and bibliography\\nBiography from Guggenheim Museum includes selected works, and suggested reading list.\\nVernissageTV Interview with Ellsworth Kelly at the Art 39 Basel Fair.\\nEllsworth Kelly in the National Gallery of Australia\\'s Kenneth Tyler collection\\nEllsworth Kelly: Sculpture on the Wall Barnes Foundation exhibition catalogue, 2013\\nSmithsonian, December 2015: Why Ellsworth Kelly Was a Giant in the World of American Art\\nUSPS Announcement of Ellsworth Kelly Stamps',\n",

       "  'Matthieu Laurette (born 1970 in Villeneuve Saint Georges, France) is a media and conceptual contemporary French artist who works in a variety of media, from TV and video to installation and public interventions.\\nHe lives and works in Paris, Amsterdam, Bogotá, Mexico, Rio de Janeiro and New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nIn 2003, Laurette received  the Ricard Prize for the most representative artist under 40 y.o. within the French scene.\\nLaurette uses various strategies to explore the relationships between conceptual art, Pop art, Institutional Critique, economics and contemporary society. His best known works  are Apparitions (1993-ongoing), Money-back Products (Produits remboursés) (1991–2001), Citizenship Project (1996-ongoing), El Gran Trueque (2000) and Déjà vu, The International Look-alike Conventions (2000-ongoing), I AM AN ARTIST (1998-ongoing), THINGS: Purchased With Funds Provided By (2010 – 2020), Tropicalize Me! (2011-ongoing) and DEMANDS & SUPPLIES (2012-ongoing).\\nIn 1993, Laurette declared himself  an artist in a French TV gameshow called Tournez manège (The Dating Game). When the presenter asked him who he was he replied: \\'A multimedia artist\\'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their homes.\\nSince his first Apparition on Tournez Manége, Laurette has been developing an ongoing series of what he calls \\'Apparitions\\' on TV and in the media. (In French the word Apparition means both \\'apparition\\' and \\'appearance\\'). Among other shows he has appeared in La Grande famille, Canal +, TV (France) (December 5, 1994), Je passe à la télé, France 3, TV (France) (May 16, 1996), Journal de 13h et Journal de 20h France 2, TV (France) (May 16, 1997).\\nLaurette\\'s Apparition: The Today Show, NBC, 31 December 2004, (Guy Debord Is So Cool!) (2004) renegotiates the critique of mass media: amongst love message banners and goofy signs being held up by the audience of the outdoor-broadcast of the NBC infotainment show on Rockefeller Plaza in New York, Laurette held a pink cardboard sign stating “GUY DEBORD IS SO COOL!”\\nLaurette\\'s Produits remboursés/Money-back Products (1993–2001) was his method of shopping and being fully refunded based on the basic marketing system of the major food and commodities corporations. He fed and cleaned himself for nothing by almost only ever buying products with \"Satisfied or your money back\" or \"Money back on first purchase\" offers. He gained fame in France and abroad at the time appearing on TV and media including in 1997 the French National evening news (Journal de 20h, France 2) and the frontpage of respected daily newspaper Le Monde with the headline \\'Tomorrow we will eat for free\\' (Demain on mange gratis). In 1999 the Daily Express in UK featured him in an article titled \"The secret of free shopping\" and in 2000 the Daily Record named him \\'The Freebie King\\'. In 2001 invited by Harald Szeemann curator of the 49th Venice Biennale he presented Moneyback Life! a large retrospective installation combining enlargements of press cuttings, a truck with an integrated TV wall showing TV clips of his Apparitions/Appearances and a life size wax figure of himself pushing a shopping cart full of Moneyback products.\\nCitizenship Project (Wanted: Financial Support to Acquire Citizenships) are a series of projects where Laurette attempts to acquire as many nationalities as possible, asking for donations as well as legal advice and practical support through donation boxes displayed in Museums and exhibitions as well as through websites. At the Venice Biennale in 2001, he offered non-represented countries national participation in the exhibition in exchange for the country granting him citizenship.\\nProduced by Consonni, El Gran Trueque (The Great Exchange) (2000), the TV game Laurette has created, with its own copyrighted concept, offered TV viewers in Bilbao a chance to buy objects in exchange for a car offered by Laurette – the highest offer would be accepted, and then in turn be presented the following week for another exchange, and so on. After a few months the series of swaps finished with a set of six blue glasses that remained unswapped.\\nThe Déjà vu - International Look-Alike Conventions featuring among others Jennifer Aniston, Sean Connery, Salvador Dalí or Angelina Jolie look-alikes mingling with the crowd of art people, collectors and real celebrities are organized by Laurette on the occasion of art openings. These events have so far been held at Dia Art Foundation Fall Gala, New York (2004), Institute of Contemporary Art, London (2003); Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania (2003); Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts, Australia (2002); Art Sonje Center, Seoul (2002); Castello di Rivoli, Torino (2001); and Centre Pompidou, Paris (2000).\\nMatthieu Laurette has been represented by Yvon Lambert Gallery, Paris (France);  Deweer Gallery, Otegem (Belgium); Gaudel de Stampa, Paris (France); La Central, Bogotá (Colombia), Blow de la Barra, London (UK); Yvon Lambert Gallery, New York (U.S.); Jousse Entreprise, Paris (France); Jousse Seguin, Paris (France).\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\"The Real World: Artist Matthieu Laurette and the prolific curator, collector and dealer Seth Siegelaub discuss the legacy of Conceptual art, the origins of curating and how art history is made.\" FRIEZE #154, April 2013 (London)\\nJoerg Heiser, Matthieu Laurette in Notre Histoire.

       "  'Kenneth Price (February 16, 1935 – February 24, 2012) was an American artist who predominantly created ceramic sculpture. He studied at the Chouinard Art Institute and Otis Art Institute (now Otis College of Art and Design) in Los Angeles, before receiving his BFA degree from the University of Southern California in 1956. He continued his studies at Chouinard Art Institute in 1957 and received an MFA degree from New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University in 1959. Kenneth Price studied ceramics with Peter Voulkos at Otis and was awarded a Tamarind Fellowship.\\nHe is best known for his abstract shapes constructed from fired clay.  Typically, they are not glazed, but intricately painted with multiple layers of bright acrylic paint and then sanded down to reveal the colors beneath. Price lived and worked in Venice, California, and Taos, New Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nPrice was born February 16, 1935, and raised in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. in 1937 when Price was approximately two years old, his family moved into a trailer on Santa Monica Beach for two years, next to Marion Davies\\'s home, while building a new house in Pacific Palisades. In 1949, Price began at University High School, at which time he took up surfing. In 1952 while at University High, Price received a scholarship to attend Chouinard Art Institute (now California Institute of the Arts), where he took classes in life drawing and cartooning taught by T. Hee.\\nPrice\\'s earliest aspirations were to be an artist, \"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be an artist. Even when I was a kid I would make drawings and little books, and cartoons..,\" he states. Price enrolled in his first art ceramics course at Santa Monica City College in 1954, where he quickly embraced a formal craft tradition as espoused by Marguerite Wildenhain. He subsequently studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, before receiving his BFA degree from the University of Southern California in 1956.\\nAs a student at USC, Price spent time visiting the ceramics studio at the Otis Art Institute where ceramic artist Peter Voulkos was teaching. Price has often cited Voulkos as his strongest single influence as a student. After finishing his degree at USC, Price spent a portion of the next year as a graduate student at Otis. There he studied (under Voulkos) with Billy Al Bengston, John Mason, Mike Frimkess, Paul Soldner, Henry Takemoto and Jerry Rothman. Price writes about the group at Otis: \"We\\'ve been cited as the people who broke away from the crafts hierarchy and substituted so-called \\'total freedom!\\' Actually we were a group of people who were committed to clay as a material and wanted to use it in ways that had something to do with our time and place.\"\\nIn 1958, Price left Otis for Alfred University (with a six-month detour in the Army Reserves). \"I went to Alfred to try and develop some low-fire, brightly colored glazes, but also to try and get away from the influence of Voulkos, which was very strong on me.\" During his time at Alfred, Price was able to formulate some of the glazes he desired, using a lead base. In 1959, Price returned to Los Angeles having received an MFA in Ceramics from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University.\\n\\n\\n=== Mid career ===\\nPrice describes Los Angeles upon his return and the beginnings of the L.A. art scene: \"When I started out in L.A. in the late fifties there was no art scene at all really. I mean there was an art scene in New York, but there wasn\\'t one in L.A. There were hardly any galleries. The museum was downtown and it didn\\'t endorse contemporary art. And there were only about three viable art publications. The local newspaper critics didn\\'t like us at all. There weren\\'t any collectors, really very few. We made few sales, and for little money when we made them. But the people I knew were totally committed. And so was I. I was confused about a lot of things at that time, but not about being an artist. I knew that\\'s what I had to be. And then later, around the mid-sixties, the whole scene cooked up: galleries, museums, foundations, art schools, and you know, lots more artists.\"\\nPrice\\'s first solo show came at the Ferus Gallery in 1960 where he quickly became part of a developing art movement that included artists such as Larry Bell, Billy Al Bengston, John Altoon, John McCracken, Robert Irwin and Ed Ruscha, among many others. Price would have three solo shows during the short time Ferus was open, and by the mid-1960s Price was a fixture in the west coast art scene. Aside from six months Price spent in Japan in 1962, Price would remain in Los Angeles until 1970, when he and his wife, Happy, relocated to Taos, New Mexico.\\nPrice\\'s second solo museum exhibition was in 1978 at LACMA, where he presented the project that had consumed him for six years, Happy\\'s Curios (1972–77), named in honor of his wife Happy. This was a room size installation made up of several wood cabinets with open shelves filled with highly colored glazed ceramic pots, plates, bowls, and cups that owed its inspiration to Mexican folk pottery.\\nAs Price\\'s career developed he began using a different approach to finishing his ceramic sculptures. In 1983, Price and his wife moved to coastal Massachusetts, where they stayed for the next eight years. The move coincided with a massive shift in Price\\'s work that would last until the end of his career, the move from glazes to acrylic paint. The technique Price began to develop during this period involved priming the fired ceramic sculpture with more than a dozen layers of acrylic paint. In 1991 After the Exhibition, Finish Fetish: L.A.\\'s Cool School, at Fisher Gallery at University of Southern California, several professors encourage Price to join the faculty. He becomes a professor of ceramics at USC where he teaches for 10 years. During that time back in Los Angeles, his son, Jackson, began to work with him in the studio, and Price experimented with using a cloth or cotton swab soaked in alcohol to work through layers of paint. This technique allowed for a blurred effect that achieved a new type of smoothness to the work. In the late 1990s, Price refined his technique still further, beginning to dry sand his acrylic painted surfaces. A technique he borrowed from the surfboard workshop according to Dave Hickey.

       "  'ORLAN is a French multi-media artist who uses sculpture, photography, performance, video, video games, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics as well as scientific and medical techniques such as surgery and biotechnology to question modern social phenomena. \\nShe has said that her art is not body art, but \\'carnal art,\\' which lacks the suffering aspect of body art.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nSince the 1960s and the 1970s, ORLAN has questioned the status of the body and the political, religious, social, and traditional pressures that are inscribed in it. Her work denounces the violence done to the body and in particular to women\\'s bodies, and thus engages in a feminist struggle. She makes her body the privileged instrument where our own relationship to otherness is played out. This work of Orlan on the body is done in particular by the means of photography.\\nIn 1976, for example, she walked the streets wearing a dress on which her naked body was represented. In the same period, in Portugal, she offered photos glued to wood and cut out corresponding to pieces of herself: an arm, a piece of breast, etc.\\nIn 1977, ORLAN performed Kiss of the artist (Baiser de l\\'artiste), during the International Fair of Contemporary Art (FIAC ), in the Grand Palais in Paris. ORLAN displayed a life-size photograph of her own nude torso, which she sat behind. The life-sized photograph was turned into a slot machine. A spectator would insert a coin and could see it descending to the groin before being awarded a kiss from the artist herself. The installation created a scandal that cost the artist her teaching position.\\nIn 1978, she created the International Symposium of the Performance in Lyon, which she animated until 1982.\\nHer manifesto of \"carnal art\" (Manifeste de l\\'Art Charnel) is followed by a series of surgical operations- performances that she carries out between 1990 and 1993. With this series, the body of the artist becomes a place of public debate. These surgical operations - performances were widely publicized and provoked a strong polemic, although they represent only a tiny part of her integral work.\\nORLAN also explores the use of new technologies in the arts.\\nIn 1982, with Frédéric Develay, she created the first online magazine of contemporary art, Art-Accès-Revue, on Minitel. \\nThis magazine invites international artists working in situ and/or with conceptual problems to create original works specially conceived on Minitel, by Minitel, and for Minitel. Many of the works play with the Videotex graphic style or ironically imitate Minitel services (Bernar Venet, Vera Molnár, Ben, François Morellet, Daniel Buren...)\\nThe works are accompanied by critical essays. The service also regularly gives the floor to the public. A public presentation of this database took place at the Centre Pompidou during the exhibition Les Immatériaux by Jean-François Lyotard. The Art-Access service has been distributed free of charge by the city of Metz server: MIRABEL.\\nIn her work of the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Self-Hybridations\", the artist, through digital photography and computer graphics editing software, hybridizes faces from different cultures (Native American, pre-Columbian, African).\\nOrlan then attempted to further expand the boundaries of contemporary art by using biotechnology to create an installation entitled Harlequin Coat made from the artist\\'s own cells and cells of human and animal origin.\\nAt the same time, ORLAN taught at the École nationale supérieure d\\'arts de Paris-Cergy. \\nIn 2005, she was awarded a one-year residency at the ISCP in New York by l\\'Association française d\\'action artistique (AFAA), and in 2006 she was invited to Los Angeles for a residency at the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Center\\'s research laboratory.\\nIn June 2013, she filed a complaint against Lady Gaga for plagiarism. For ORLAN, the American star, in the album Born This Way released in 2011, was too freely inspired by her \"hybridizations\". In addition, the beginning of the video clip of the homonymous song shows Lady Gaga made up and decapitated recalling her \"Woman with head\" executed in 1996. The artist sought $31.7 million in compensation. The plea hearing had been set for July 7, 2016, at the Paris high court. A first verdict was announced in the disadvantage of ORLAN, who then had to pay 20,000 euros to the singer, but the artist decided to appeal. In May 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed ORLAN by confirming the absence of the parasitic nature of the video clip incriminated. Orlan was ordered to pay 10,000 euros, as costs incurred, to Lady Gaga.\\nShe received the Grand Prix de le-Réputation 2013, organized by Alexia Guggemos in the visual arts category, which rewards the most popular personalities on the internet, alongside Philippe Starck and Yann Arthus-Bertrand\\nSince October 18, 2018, ORLAN is represented in France by the Ceysson & Bénétière Gallery in Paris.\\nIn 2019, she was a member of the jury of the Opline Prize, the first online contemporary art prize.\\nDuring the lockdown linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, she wrote her autobiography, \\'\"Strip-Tease : tout sur ma vie, tout sur mon art\" published by Gallimard in the collection Témoins de l\\'Art.\\nOn November 29, 2021, she was decorated with the National Order of the Legion of Honor to the rank of Knight by the Minister of Culture Roselyne Bachelot.\\n\\n\\n=== The Reincarnation of Sainte- ORLAN ===\\nIn 1990, Orlan began The Reincarnation of Sainte- ORLAN. It involved a series of plastic surgeries through which the artist transformed herself into elements from famous paintings and sculptures of women. As a part of her \"Carnal Art\" manifesto, these works were filmed and broadcast in institutions throughout the world, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Sandra Gehring Gallery in New York.\\nORLAN picked these characters, \"not for the canons of beauty they represent... but rather on account of the stories associated with them.\"\\n\\nORLAN defines cosmetic surgery as \"nomadic, mutant, shifting, differing.\" ORLAN has stated, \"my work is a struggle against the innate, the inexorable, the programmed, Nature, DNA (which is our direct rival as far as artists of representation are concerned), and God!\". In an interview with Acne Paper, ORLAN stated:I can observe my own body cut open, without suffering!... I see myself all the way down to my entrails; a new mirror stage... I can see to the heart of my lover; his splendid design has nothing to do with sickly sentimentalities... Darling, I love your spleen; I love your liver; I adore your pancreas, and the line of your femur excites me.\" (from Carnal Art manifesto)\\n\"Sainte ORLAN\" came from a character that I created for \"Le baiser de l\\'artiste\" from a text called \"Facing a society of mothers and merchants.\" The first line of this text was: \"At the bottom of the cross were two women, Maria and Maria Magdalena.\" These are two inevitable stereotypes of women that are hard to avoid: the mother and the prostitute. In \"Le baiser de l\\'artiste\" there were two faces. One was Saint ORLAN, a cutout picture of me dressed as Madonna glued onto wood. One could buy a five francs church candle and I was sitting on the other side behind the mock-up of the vending machine. One could buy a French kiss from me for the same amount of money one could buy a candle. The idea was to play on the ambivalence of the woman figure and the desire of both men and women towards those biblical and social stereotypes.\\n\\nBeing showcased in the Paris International Contemporary Art Fair. \\n\\n\\n== In the 2000s ==\\nIn 2001, ORLAN orchestrated a series of filmic posters, \"Le Plan du Film,\" with various artists and writers.\\nShe collaborated in 2008 with the Symbiotica laboratory in Australia, resulting in the bio-art installation \"The Harlequin\\'s Coat.\"Part of ORLAN\\'s ongoing work includes \"Suture/Hybridize/Recycle,\" a generative and collaborative series of clothing made from ORLAN\\'s wardrobe and focusing on suture: the deconstruction of past clothing reconstructed into new clothing that highlights the sutures.\\nIn June 2013, she filed a complaint against Lady Gaga. For ORLAN, the American star, in the album Born This Way released in 2011 is inspired by the artist without quoting her. The beginning of the video clip of the homonymous song shows Lady Gaga with implants similar to those of ORLAN and the face of Lady Gaga beheaded recalls the work Woman with head created in 1996. Her lawyer was asking for compensation of 31.7 million dollars. The hearing was set for July 7, 2016, at the Tribunal de la Grande Instance de Paris. A first verdict was announced against ORLAN but the artist decided to appeal. In May 2018, the Court of Appeal of Paris rejected ORLAN by confirming the absence of the parasitic nature of the video clip.\\nIt receives the Reputation on line Prize (Grand Prix de le-réputation) in 2013, organized by the art critic Alexia Guggemos, Plastic Arts category, which rewards the most popular personalities on the Internet alongside Phillipe Starck for design and Yann Arthus-Bertrand for photography.\\nIn 2018, ORLAN created a robot in her own image, \" Orlanoïde\", equipped with collective and social artificial intelligence that speaks with her voice by reading texts from a text generator: presented at the Grand Palais, for the exhibition \"Artists and Robots\", the robot is also part of a performance entitled \"Electronic and verbal striptease\" and also benefits from a motion generator. It is a work in progress, currently, the developers of the Art and science gallery in Dublin are developing other capacities.\\nIn 2019, she was honored with the special prize of WOMAN OF THE YEAR, awarded by the Prince of Monte Carlo.\\nOrlan is also appointed Professor Emeritus of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma.\\nDuring the confinement in 2020, Orlan wrote her autobiography Strip-tease : tout sur ma vie, tout sur mon art published by Gallimard on the 3rd of June, 2021.\\nOn November 29, 2021, she was decorated with the National Order of the Legion of Honor with the rank of Knight by the Minister of Culture Roselyne Bachelot\\nShe is represented in France by the Ceysson & Bénétière Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Recent works ===\\nLe Slow de l\\'artiste, 2021\\nORLAN et l\\' Orlanoïde strip-tease artistique électronique et verbal,2018, Exhibition Artistes et robots, Grand Palais, Paris, France: a humanoid in the image of Orlan (but exposing its mechanical armature) sings or speaks using her voice, dances, using information gathered collectively and in conjunction with deep learning algorithms\\nTangible Striptease en Nanoséquences, 2016, Centre des Arts, Enghien-les-Bains and Université Paris Diderot, Paris, France : ORLAN, in collaboration with Mael Le Mée, created a performance in which the ORLAN-corps, in the form of biological samples and cultures of its microbiota, circulated among the spectators\\nExpérimentale mise en jeu, 2015: video game in which the viewer, by means of MYOS bracelets, controls an avatar of the artist. The aim of the character is to restore works that have been destroyed, with each progression in the restoration, the central character builds his humanity and finally, the ruined landscape is rebuilt. This game is based on the idea that \"killing is not playing\"\\nSelf-hybridations Masques de l\\'Opéra de Pékin, Facing Design et réalité augmentée, 2014 : the artist\\'s most recent series of self-hybridizations in which she hybridizes her face with typical Pekin Opera masks. This interactive photographic series uses augmented reality. The viewer, by scanning the work as a QR code, sees appear on his screen an avatar of Orlan performing acrobatics of the Pekin Opera, he can then photograph himself or other spectators with the avatar share and share his pictures online\\nLa liberté en écorchée, 2013 : this 3D video shows the artist\\'s body modeled in 3D. It is a manifesto insisting both on the \"flayed\" nature of artists and on his responsibility concerning this notion of freedom to be constantly defended.\\nRobes sans corps, Sculptures de plis, 2010: sculptures of drapery without body, in gold leaf resin or platinum\\n\\n\\n=== Emblematic works ===\\nSome of her emblematic works include : \\n\\nORLAN accouche d\\'elle-m\\'aime, 1964: in this black and white photography, ORLAN gives birth to a character like an inert and androgynous body, neither man nor woman. This work symbolizes the artist\\'s desire to give birth to herself, to invent a new identity. This series is part of the Corps-sculptures. It is created a few months after an abortion of the artist.\\nMesuRages (1974-2011): the name chosen for this series of actions insists on the word \"Rage\" since the artist refuses to play the role that one wants to impose on her. Using the \" ORLAN-body\", a new unit of measurement, the artist will measure St. Peter\\'s Square in Rome, Chateaubriand Street in Nice, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, the St. Peter\\'s Museum in Lyon, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp and the Guggenheim Museum in New-York. On the Place Saint-Lambert in Liège, Orlan\\'s \"MesuRage\" takes on a political character, since the artist was invited by an association campaigning for the defense of this square, which is threatened by an urban planning operation.\\nLe Baiser de l\\'artiste: a 1977 performance at the Grand Palais, where the International Contemporary Art Fair was taking place. Seated behind life-size photography of her naked bust, treated like an ATM, ORLAN calls out to the public: \"Come closer, come to my pedestal, that of the myths: the mother, the whore, the artist\" . On a black platform, she monetizes her kisses, while to her right another photographic silhouette pasted on wood shows her as a Virgin to whom one can, for the same price, offer a candle. This action caused a great scandal and was highly publicized. This work was exhibited in 2008 in the exhibition WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington D.C, the Vancouver Art Gallery, MOCA Gefen in Los Angeles, and the P.S 1 Contemporary Art Center in New York.\\nLe Drapé-le Baroque (1979-1986): this series of photographs constitutes a complex and rather suggestive iconography on the spiritual level, with characters inspired by Christian iconographies, such as Saint ORLAN, the white virgin, and the black virgin. These works are a continuation of ORLAN\\'s quest for female identity, her critique of religious pressures and her staging of the Baroque.\\nL’Origine de la guerre: in 1989, is a counterpart to Gustave Courbet\\'s famous painting, The Origin of the World. A phallus spread legs with head, arms, and legs cut off, taking up and \"transvestising\" Courbet\\'s feminine iconography, illustrates the title in a gesture that does not detract from feminism.\\nLa Réincarnation de sainte ORLAN: begun in 1990, or Images / Nouvelles Images, comprises a series of nine cosmetic surgery operations/performances, during which ORLAN makes her flesh the material of her work and takes as its basis the representations of women in Western art. Each of ORLAN\\'s carefully planned and executed operations/performances are staged and controlled by the artist. Through these interventions, she \"put the figure on her face.\" She chooses the literalness of the performance to speak about the violence done to the body, in particular to women\\'s bodies, and to question the models of beauty. For example, ORLAN had implants usually put to raise the cheekbones on each side of the forehead, creating two horn-like bumps on the temples.\\nOmniprésence(November 1993): ORLAN meets Dr. Marjorie Cramer in New York, a surgeon who accepts the artistic and feminist objectives of her project: the radical transformation of her face by implants in the temples. The objective is to divert plastic surgery from its usual objectives and to question the standards of beauty. This operation/performance is broadcast live in her exhibition at the Sandra Gering Gallery in New York, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, at the Mac Luhan Center in Toronto, at the Banff Multimedia Center, and on CNN.\\nCeci est mon corps…Ceci est mon logiciel… is a performance conference on May 30, 1990, accompanied by a book and a CD-Rom. She develops there the Manifesto of the carnal art (Manifeste de l\\'art charnel)\\nLe plan du film (2001): following the example of Jean-Luc Godard, who spoke of the production of a \"film in reverse\", ORLAN starts from the creation of cinema posters to then define the casting, the script, a promotional evening at the Fondation Cartier for contemporary art, a soundtrack by the group Tanger, the trailer of the film, the producer. She exhibited all of this work at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 at the Hôtel Martinez.\\nSelf-hybridizations(1998-2002): digital images featuring the artist in physical metamorphoses (virtual this time) questioning the canons of beauty of other civilizations (Amerindian, pre-Columbian and African). Using computer processes, Orlan transforms her image in a way that brings her closer to pre-Columbian (such as the deformation of the Mayan skull), African, Egyptian, Amerindian, and Merovingian cultural traditions. This work is in the continuity of her previous works where she denounced the social pressures that our society inflicts on the body and appearance. Here she stages the absurdity of these criteria, which are opposed according to the time or the civilization in which one lives. The image of the ideal body becomes completely abstract and ironic.\\nLe Manteau d\\'Arlequin: it is an installation mixing art and biotechnologies, created with living cells of Orlan, cells of different origins, and even animal cells. This work is inspired by Michel Serres\\' text, Laïcité, placed as a preface to his book Le Tiers Instruit. Michel Serres uses the figure of the Harlequin as a metaphor for crossing, accepting the other, conjunction, intersection. Le Manteau d\\'Arlequin develops and continues to explore the idea of crossing using the more carnal medium of skin. It also questions the relationship between biotechnology and artistic culture. This installation has been presented in Perth, Liverpool, Luxembourg.\\nHer ultimate work would be to place her mummified body in a museum, but it seems that the artist has not yet found a public collection to display this work.\\nORLAN\\'s works can be found in the collections of various museums, including the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Maison européenne de la photographie, Fonds nation d\\'art contemporain, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Getty Center, the National Museum of Art, Osaka, the Museum of Modern Art, as well as various private collections, including the François Pinault Collection.\\n\\n\\n== Galleries and collections ==\\n\\n\\n=== Galleries ===\\nOrlan is represented by various galleries internationally:\\n\\nGallery Ceysson & Bénétière, Paris, New-York, Luxembourg, Saint-Étienne, Genève\\nGallery Ace, Los Angeles, États-Unis ;\\nGallery Stux, New York, États-Unis ;\\nGallery Michel Rein, Paris, France ;\\nGallery Prometeo, Milan, Italie ;\\nGallery Spaivisor, Valence, Espagne\\nGallery Sejul, Séoul, Corée du Sud\\n\\n\\n=== Public collections ===\\nEurope\\n\\nNational Museum of Modern Art, Paris, France.\\nEuropean House of Photography, Paris, France.\\nFrench Museum of Photography, Bièvres, France.\\nDepartmental Museum of Ancient and Contemporary Art, Épinal, France.\\nMuseum of the New World, La Rochelle, France.\\nMuseum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Saint-Étienne, Saint-Étienne, France.\\nMuseum of Arts, Nantes, France.\\nNational Fund for Contemporary Art, Puteaux, France.\\nArt library, La Réunion, France.\\nRegional Funds for Contemporary Art in France:\\nFRAC Île-de-France;\\nFRAC Pays-de-la-Loire;\\nFRAC Rhône-Alpes;\\nFRAC Basse-Normandie.\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art of Lyon, Lyon, France.\\nMuseum of Art, Lodz, Poland.\\nNorth America\\n\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York, États-Unis.\\nMusée d\\'Art du comté de Los Angeles, Los Angeles, États-Unis.\\nMusée d\\'Art contemporain de Los Angeles, Los Angeles, États-Unis.\\nJ.

       "  'Guy Bleus (born October 23, 1950) is a Belgian artist, archivist and writer. He is associated with olfactory art, visual poetry, performance art and the mail art movement.\\nHis work covers different areas, including administration (which he calls Artministration), postal and olfactory communication.\\n\\n\\n== Art and archive ==\\nGuy Bleus was born in Hasselt, Belgium. In 1978 he founded The Administration Centre – 42.292 which became a huge art archive with the works and information of 6000 artists from more than 60 countries. \"Guy Bleus has one of the finest archives of mail art in Europe, if not the world.\"\\nBleus was the first artist who systematically used scents in plastic arts. In 1978 he wrote the olfactory manifesto The Thrill of Working with Odours in which he deplores the lack of interest in scents in the visual arts. Since then he showed smell paintings, mailed perfumed objects and made aromatic installations; he also created spray performances where he sprayed a mist of fragrance over the audience.\\nExploring the possibilities of communication media as art media, he investigated the postal system in Indirect correspondence (1979) and searched for an alternative postal system in Airmail by balloons. Together with Charles François he was a pioneer using a computer connected to a modem for artistic communication (in 1989). He also applied reproduction media such as Microfilm, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM for artistic reasons.\\n\\n\\n== Performance works ==\\nOne of his performance works from the 1980s was documented in the artists\\' periodical Force Mental. The performance took place in the venue Il Ventuno in Hasselt, and is described as follows: \\n\"Guy Bleus wears a costume made of official stamps of 1/2fr. He cuts his moustache into a Hitler-moustache. Against the wall he hangs photocopies of Hitler\\'s head. Enlargements whereby the moustache is growing bigger (till A3 format). Bleus sticks then stamps, the same as of which his costume is made of and stamps them with his number-stamp: 42.292. Then he sticks a naked girl full with stamps of 1/2fr and stamps them with the number stamp. Finally he cuts off his Hitler-moustache and breaks a mirror.\"\\nAnother fascinating performance of Bleus is called \\'Value Shredder\\' (1982, Brussels, Gallery Entr\\'Act). Bleus took hundreds of real 50 Belgian franc banknotes and made a suit out of them. Wearing this suit he began his performance. He gave the audience plastic raincoats to put on and asked them to hand over their identity cards. He put the cards into a paper shredder, then tore up Mein Kampf and threw the pages into the shredder too. When everything was completely shredded he blew odours and flour over the public with a fan. Finally, he removed his suit and set it on fire. After the performance the public received an identity card from planet Mars. A life-size photo of Bleus\\'s money suit is part of the art collection of the National Bank of Belgium (NBB).\\nTo honor the Italian artist Guglielmo Achille Cavellini Guy Bleus organized the four-day \"Cavellini Festival 1984\" in the cities of Antwerp, Brussels, Eeklo, Hasselt, and Tienen. In the administrative performance \"First President of the USE\" in Brussels, capital of Europe, Bleus officially declared Cavellini the very first president of the United States of Europe.\\n\\n\\n== Networking and projects ==\\nNumerous are the international art projects Bleus has organised, such as Are you experienced? L.H.F.S. (1981), W.A.A.: Mail eARTh Atlas (1981–83), Telegraphy (1983), Aerograms (1984), Cavellini Festival 1984, Art is Books (1991), Fax Performances (1992–1993), Private Art Detective: Sealed Confessions, and Building Plans & Schemes (1993).\\nHe wrote and published many essays on the subject of networking art. About his essay Exploring Mail Art (1984), Géza Perneckzy wrote: “The study of Guy Bleus outranks all other publications with its theoretical weight and conciseness.” Moreover, he contributed to significant publications, such as Piotr Rypson’s Mail Art, Chuck Welch\\'s Eternal Network, A Mail Art Anthology, or Vittore Baroni’s Postcards – Cartoline d’artista. He participated in many artists\\' periodicals.\\nFrom 1994 till 1999 he opened in Hasselt the art gallery E-Mail-Art Archives. In this non-profit space more than 40 events of mail art, fax art and Internet art took place. Artists such as Ben Vautier, Shozo Shimamoto, Anna Banana, Julien Blaine, H.R. Fricker and Clemente Padin were exhibited.\\nIn 1995 he edited The Artistamp Collection, the first mail art catalogue on CD-ROM. With the participation of networking artists such as Vittore Baroni, Ken Friedman, John Held Jr., Ruud Janssen, György Galántai, Pawel Petasz and Géza Perneczky, he published in 1997 the first E-Mail-Art & Internet-Art Manifesto, an issue of his electronic zine.\\nAfter a bureaucratic venture of 20 years he realised in 2003 (together with Jean Spiroux) the very first postage stamp on the theme mail art edited by an official Postal Service. It was an edition of 4 million copies realised by the Belgian Postal Service.\\nIn 2005–2006 Bleus organised the olfactory mail art project Scents, Locks & Kisses with 778 artists from 43 countries in the Art Museum Z33. The website is a slideshow with all the works of the participating artists.\\nA retrospective of his work was held in the Cultural Centre of Hasselt in 2010. The publication Pêle-Mêle: Guy Bleus® – 42.292 had bracts perfumed with lavender essence and included a re-edition of his ID from planet Mars of 1979.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Publications by Guy Bleus-42.292 ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nmailart.be\\nJohn Held Jr.\\nMatt Ferranto\\nGuy Bleus: Pêle-Mêle on YouTube\\nMail artists Index\\nMerzmail\\nIuoma',\n",

       "  'Robert Gober (born September 12, 1954) is an American sculptor. His work is often related to domestic and familiar objects such as sinks, doors, and legs.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nGober was born in Wallingford, Connecticut and studied literature and then fine art at Middlebury College, Vermont and the Tyler School of Art in Rome. Gober settled in New York in 1976 and initially earned his living as a carpenter, crafting stretchers for artists and renovating lofts. He also worked as an assistant to the painter Elizabeth Murray for five years.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nGober\\'s work is often related to domestic and familiar objects such as sinks, doors, and legs, and has themes of nature, sexuality, religion, and politics. The sculptures are meticulously handcrafted, even when they appear to just be a re-creation of a common sink. While he is best known for his sculptures, he has also made photographs, prints, drawings and has curated exhibitions.\\nIn 1982-83, Gober created Slides of a Changing Painting, consisting of 89 images of paintings made on a small piece of plywood in his storefront studio in the East Village; he made a slide of each motif, then scraped off the paint and began again. One of his most well known series of more than 50 increasingly eccentric sinks – made of plaster, wood, wire lath, and coated in layers of semi-gloss enamel – he produced in the mid-1980s.\\nBy 1989, Gober was casting beeswax into sculptures of men\\'s legs, completed not only with shoes and trouser legs but also human hair that was inserted into the beeswax.\\nIn the Whitney Biennial 2012, Gober curated a room of Forrest Bess\\'s paintings and archival materials dealing with the artist\\'s exploration into hermaphrodism. He also curated \"Heat Waves in a Swamp: The Paintings of Charles Burchfield\" at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles in 2009 (which traveled to the Burchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York in 2010).\\n\\n\\n== Art plays a role during the AIDS epidemic ==\\nDuring the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, Robert Gober, along with other artists, used art to support the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). ACT UP was a large group of people that were infuriated by the lack of action from the government and scientists to stop the spread of AIDS and find a cure. A few artists, including Gober, organized an art auction to help raise funds to donate to ACT UP. Gober\\'s Untitled (Leg) (1989-1990) alone was sold at a very high price, which helped prove to the public that art can be used to make the voices of the people be heard, to fight for a cause that is important to the communities, and that art is not just a commodity, nor is art just for pleasure. Robert Gober\\'s sculptures portrayed a different aspect to the way art had been seen, he used his sculptures to send a strong message to the viewers.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1984, the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York hosted Gober\\'s first solo exhibition.  The Art Institute of Chicago presented the artist\\'s first museum exhibition in 1988. Gober has since had exhibitions of his work in Europe and North America. He represented the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale and has had several one-person museum exhibitions including at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and Dia Art Foundation, New York.\\nHis work has also been included in five Whitney Biennials, including the 2000 Whitney Biennial with Sarah Sze, Doug Aitken, Cai Guo-Qiang, Louise Lawler and Richard Tuttle.\\nIn 2007 there was a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Schaulager in Basel. The exhibition was accompanied by a comprehensive book of his sculptures entitled Robert Gober. Sculptures and Installations 1979-2007.\\nGober participated in the group show Lifelike that originated at the Walker Art Center in 2012.\\nFrom October 2014 to January 2015, The Museum of Modern Art, New York presented \"Robert Gober: The Heart Is Not a Metaphor\", a 40-year retrospective of his work including approximately 130 sculptures, paintings, drawings, prints and photographs. This exhibition was the first large-scale display in the United States. It was also accompanied by a catalogue of the same name including essays by Hilton Als, Ann Temkin and Christian Scheidemann, plus a chronology by Claudia Carson and Paulina Pobocha with Robert Gober.\\nGober created a three-story permanent installation in the Haunted House at the Fondazione Prada, Milan which opened in May 2015. In autumn 2016, two new sculptures by Gober were included in the Artangel exhibition at Reading Prison in England.\\nIn Autumn 2018, Glenstone in Potomac, Maryland opened a long-term pavilion of his work.\\nGober is represented by Matthew Marks Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 2013, the Hammer Museum honored Gober along with playwright Tony Kushner at its 11th Annual Gala in the Garden, with Gober being introduced by fellow artist Charles Ray. He received The Larry Aldrich Foundation Award in 1996, the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture in 1999, and the Archives of American Art Medal in 2015. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, as well as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\\n\\n\\n== Aesthetics ==\\nTraditionally the poetics associated with Rober Gober’s artworks are focused on two fields: The surreal and the spiritual: \\n\"The almost devotional artisanship imbues common objects with an uncommon gravity, along with the sense of energy, growth and vulnerability that defines real bodies.\" Roberta Smith. “He plays with the tension between the neutered forms and the strong emotional and physical connotations we attach to them.” Craig Gholson.\\nHis artworks represent \"The daily human war on dirt \" Peter Schjeldahl., it works both literally and symbolically. \"To be cleansed is to become pure, physically and also spiritually.\" David Carrier. \\n“A good way to make lighter the weight of our thoughts is to sink them in water; it works for certain cases of schizophrenia -like that of our society-.” Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo. In some cases the lavatories represent both the cyclical approach to be cleaner but the impossibility to be fully pure: \"The sink still has no water, and the past will never wash off.\" Jason Farago.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGober lives with his partner Donald Moffett. They reside in New York City and Maine.\\nGober served on the board of directors of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts (FCA), as well as on the board of the Hetrick-Martin Institute.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nRobert Gober at the Matthew Marks Gallery Archived 2016-04-15 at the Wayback Machine\\nartcyclopedia\\nSan Francisco museum of art\\ncollection at the Guggenheim\\n1978-2000: Rephotographs\\nMilwaukee Art Museum\\n[1]\\n[2]',\n",
       "  'Peter Wayne Lewis (born 1953) is a Jamaican-American contemporary artist known for his large-scale abstract paintings, many of which are combined to form singular floor-to-ceiling works of art.  Lewis has contributed paintings to exhibitions internationally, and has presented solo shows in Europe, North America, Asia and especially China.\\n\\n\\n== Series Development and Exhibitions ==\\nLewis\\'s first exhibition of large paintings in grid format (a \"series\"), “Beijing Booster Griot,” opened at the Sunshine International Art Museum in the Songzhuang Art Colony in Beijing, China in 2008.  “Beijing Booster Griot” appeared again in a solo exhibition in 2015, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami, along with additional \"Booster\" series paintings.\\nFrom January to March 2016, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing presented two parallel exhibitions showcasing the works of  Lewis and Frederick J. Brown (1945-2012), \"two artists of the African diaspora whose expressive paintings draw inspiration from their respective cultural backgrounds and shared interest in jazz and spirituality.\" In 1988, Brown had become the first American artist to display his work at the National Museum of China. Along with Brown\\'s work, Lewis exhibited two major suites, each comprising fifteen paintings. \"There is an idea in string theory that all matter exists as vibrating strings moving in multiple dimensions. This idea links physics to my great love, music. The vibration of the strings creates harmony - the universe is a symphony of color and light and different time signatures,\" Lewis said. Titled \"Monk Time Suite\" (2013) and \"Buddha Plays Monk\" (2012-2015), the two suites were painted in China. The exhibition, the first time the works had been shown publicly, made use of the high walls of UCCA\\'s nave to display the groupings in large grids. The \"Buddha Plays Monk\" suite consisted of 15 paintings, each measuring 42 by 36 inches (107cm by 91cm), arranged in a three-by-five grid. A group of six paintings titled \"False Vacuum\" (2015), inspired by the ideas of MIT physicist Alan Guth, was also displayed.\\nIn 2019 Lewis presented the \"Beijing Booster\" series again as a solo exhibition at the Delaware Contemporary. The painting series \"Bending Time Paintings\" was first exhibited in a solo exhibition at Red Gate Gallery in Beijing, China in 2019. He presented an online exhibition of a variety of paintings at Skoto Gallery in New York City in 2021.\\n\\nHis next series, \"Buoyancy,\" had its debut at Skoto Gallery in New York City in early 2023. The series was prompted by a trans-Atlantic voyage from Florida to Venice, Italy in 2022, an opposite-direction Middle Passage his ancestors would have made between Africa and Jamaica. \"This experience transformed my sensibilities and humanness. The \\'Buoyancy\\' paintings, as all of my work, deal with stasis, trying to find some sort of balance and grounding. Being an immigrant from Kingston, Jamaica and migrating to the USA in 1962 forever changed me and my sense of place and meaning. Balancing through the physics of being buoyant on a vessel across an aqueous body, as well as moving through the cosmos in this world never escapes me.\"\\n\\n\\n== Art Career ==\\n\\nLewis met Norman Parish in 1991, the owner of a gallery for Black artists in Georgetown, Washington, DC who subsequently represented him and presented his work. Shortly after Lewis moved to the east coast in early 1992, he was introduced to artist Lorenzo Pace. Pace introduced him to an array of artists and jazzmen in the Bowery and the New York City area, including poet Amiri Baraka.\\nLater in 1992 he became the artist-in-residence in Viechtach, Bavaria, Germany where he produced 70 works in two months for an exhibition at the Kunsthaus Ostbayern. In 1993, he participated in his first exhibition in New York City at the Stephen Rosenberg Gallery.\\nIn 1995 Lewis produced three solo exhibitions with his \"Black and Blue Swan Suites\" paintings. The first was called the \"Blue Swan Suite\" paintings at Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art, which was his first New York City one-person exhibition. The second was called the \"Blue & Black Swan Series\" at the Frederick Spratt Gallery in San Jose, California. The third show, \"Peter Wayne Lewis: Paintings,\" was mounted at the Parish Gallery in Georgetown, Washington, DC.  In addition, the \"Black Swan Suite\" was included in the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition \"Caribbean Visions,\" curated by Dr. Samella Lewis.\\nIn 2000, his exhibition at Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art featured his new \"Fields Series.\" His next body of work, \"Strings,\" was based on quantum physics string theory and jazz music. He first exhibited \"Strings\" in 2003 in New York City. That same year, he assembled a solo show at the Stella Jones Gallery in New Orleans. Lewis was a 2005 artist-in-residence in Eschlkam, Germany that culminated in the opening of the Kunst Pyramid project \"Licht und Shatten - Light and Shadow,\" sponsored by the state of Bavaria. Lewis’ work appeared again as an invited artist in the Biennial at the National Gallery of Jamaica in 2006.\\nLewis’s “Eye of the Magnet” painting was exhibited in the 5th Beijing International Art Biennale in 2012.\\nIn October 2023, his solo exhibition at the b. sakata garo gallery in Sacramento included work on canvas as well as scroll paintings executed on rice paper. Lewis was the Kingsley Art Club Speaker Series lecturer that same month.\\n\\n\\n== Life and Teaching Career ==\\nLewis was born in Kingston, Jamaica and immigrated to Sacramento, California with his parents in 1962. As a boy in the 1950s, Lewis wanted to be a musician akin to his father, a jazz pianist. “I grew up listening to music and have a great appreciation for it, but I did not have that gift,” he said, and instead channeled his love of music into large-scale abstract paintings. He received his M.A.in Painting from San Jose State University in 1979, and became an American citizen in1983. He began his teaching career in 1989 as a visiting professor of painting at the San Francisco Art Institute, followed by a guest professorship in painting at San Jose State University. He then became a professor of painting at the University of California, Berkeley in 1991 and moved to the New York City area later that year. He taught at Syracuse University from 1993 until 1995, when he was appointed Professor of Painting at the Massachusetts College of Art & Design (MCAD) in Boston. He was a tenured professor for 25 years, serving as Department Chairman for Fine Arts 2D from 2006-2009.  He retired from MCAD as a professor emeritus in 2020.\\nLewis has a wide range of influences, from his early attraction to Japanese art to his lifelong interest in music, the legacy of his father, a professional musician who played jazz piano and organ. Later in his career he became interested in theoretical cosmology and quantum physics (especially string theory), concepts which pushed his work into new directions in the series \"Strings.\"\\n\\n\\n== Selected Solo Exhibitions ==\\n1984   Paintings, Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, CA\\n1986   Paintings, San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, CA\\n1987   Recent Abstract Images, Monterey Peninsula Museum of Art, Monterey, CA \\n1990   Works on Paper, Kunsthaus Ostbayern, Viechtach, Germany\\n1995   Blue and Black Swan Suite Selections, Parish Gallery, Washington, DC; Black Swan Suite, Frederick Spratt Gallery, San Jose, CA, Blue Swan Suite Paintings, Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art, New York, NY\\n1997   Replicant, Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art, New York, NY \\n2000   Fields, Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art, New York, NY \\n2002   Dream Paintings, Parish Gallery, Washington, DC (now part of the Smithsonian Institution)\\n2003   Paintings, Stella Jones Gallery, New Orleans, LA; Strings, Rosenberg + Kaufman Fine Art, New York, NY\\n2008   Booster Paintings, Galerie Im Cordonhaus, Cham, Germany; Grand: The Booster Paintings, JAYJAY, Sacramento, CA\\n2009   Paintings, Promo-Arte, Tokyo, Japan\\n2011   Paintings from Middle Earth Part 2, Matthias Kuper Galleries, Beijing, China; Paintings from Middle Earth Part 1, JAYJAY, Sacramento, CA\\n2012  Paintings from Middle Earth Part 3, Promo-Arte, Tokyo, Japan \\n2013  Paintings from Middle Earth 4, Skoto Gallery, New York, NY; Strings, Matthias Kuper Galleries, Stuttgart, Germany \\n2015  The Booster Paintings, Museum of Contemporary Art-North Miami, FL.; The Brain Paintings, Skoto Gallery, New York, NY\\n2015/16 Peter Wayne Lewis & Frederick J.

       "  'Lee Lozano (November 5, 1930 – October 2, 1999) was an American painter, and visual and conceptual artist.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nBorn Lenore Knaster in Newark, New Jersey, she started to use the name \"Lee\" at the age of fourteen, often preferring to go by the simpler, if more enigmatic \"E\". She attended the University of Chicago as an undergraduate from 1948 to 1951, studying philosophy and natural sciences, and received a B.A. She married Adrian Lozano, a Mexico-born architect, in 1956; they divorced four years later. During the marriage she earned a B.F.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago.\\nAfter traveling in Europe for a year, Lozano moved to New York City to pursue a career as an artist. She had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966. Many of her early paintings and drawings were done in a raw expressionistic style. Her so-called \"comix\" often featured hand-held tools embellished to resemble genitalia or positioned in a suggestive manner. These images were sometimes accompanied by provocative texts and sexual innuendos. Lozano\\'s art of this period is often compared to early works by Claes Oldenburg and late works by Philip Guston. In the late 1960s, she experimented with a more Minimalist aesthetic, creating monochromatic Wave paintings based on the physics of light.\\n\\n\\n=== Career as a conceptualist ===\\nLike many of her contemporaries, including Adrian Piper and Vito Acconci, Lozano began to pursue conceptual art projects starting in the mid-1960s. In February 1969 she commenced her General Strike Piece, in which she withdrew from the New York art world. Her instructions to herself were as follows: GRADUALLY BUT DETERMINEDLY AVOID BEING PRESENT AT OFFICIAL OR PUBLIC \"UPTOWN\" FUNCTIONS OR GATHERINGS RELATED TO THE \"ART WORLD\" IN ORDER TO PURSUE INVESTIGATIONS OF TOTAL PERSONAL AND PUBLIC REVOLUTION. EXHIBIT IN PUBLIC ONLY PIECES WHICH FURTHER SHARING OF IDEAS & INFORMATION RELATED TO TOTAL PERSONAL AND PUBLIC REVOLUTION. In April 1969, Lozano began her Grass and No-Grass pieces, in which she smoked and abstained (semi-successfully) from marijuana every day for several weeks at a time. In 1969 Lee\\'s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde journal which experimented with language and meaning-making.\\nIn August 1971, she began another notorious work of refusal, Decide to Boycott Women. What began as a one-month experiment intended to improve communication with women wound up as a twenty-seven year hiatus from speaking or otherwise relating to them. Her systematic rejection of all members of her own gender lasted for the remainder of her life; she effectively cut off ties with friends, fellow artists, gallerists, and other women who had been long-time supporters of her art, including the feminist curator and art critic Lucy Lippard. Art historian and critic Helen Molesworth has noted that these two conceptual works signaled Lozano\\'s simultaneous rejection of capitalism and patriarchy.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works ==\\nLee Lozano\\'s Tool Paintings is a series of paintings of screwdrivers, bolts, wrenches, clamps, and hammers, anthropomorphized so that they appear to be in sexualized motion. She began painting objects that identified with male power and productivity in 1963.\\nIn 1967, the artist made a list of her titles of paintings called ‘ALL VERBS: REAM, SPIN, VEER, SPAN, CROSS, RAM, PEEL, CHARGE, PITCH, VERGE, SWITCH, SHOOT, SLIDE, JUT, HACK, BREACH, STROKE, STOP’. Her list is in advance of Richard Serra\\'s ‘Verb List Compilation: Actions to Relate to Oneself’ from 1967 to 1968. The paintings were compositions of edges and spirals in greyscale.\\nUntitled (General Strike Piece), begun in 1969, in which she cut herself off from the commercial art world; and Boycott Piece, which began in 1971, as a month-long experiment intended to improve communication but became a permanent \"boycott\" of speaking to or directly interacting with women. She notes that “Dropout Piece is the hardest work I have ever done.\"\\n\\n\\n== Final years ==\\nAfter being evicted from her studio loft on Grand & Green Street in SoHo, Lozano moved uptown to St. Nicholas Avenue until she moved to her parents\\' house in Dallas, Texas in 1982, culminating yet another project (Drop Out). She continued to pursue private conceptual projects, including Masturbation Investigation and Dialogue Piece, but fell into relative obscurity until the late 1990s, when she was diagnosed with inoperable cervical cancer. She was persuaded to allow several concurrent exhibitions of her work, three at SoHo galleries and one at the Wadsworth Atheneum, which revived her legacy just before her death in 1999 at the age of 68.\\nInterviewed in 2001, Lucy Lippard noted that \"Lee was extraordinarily intense, one of the first, if not the first person (along with Ian Wilson) who did the life-as-art thing. The kind of things other people did as art, she really did as life—and it took us a while to figure that out.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nMichelle Pirano, Target Practice: Painting Under Attack 1949–78.

       "  'Jack Smith (November 14, 1932 – September 18, 1989) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pioneer of underground cinema. He is generally acclaimed as a founding father of American performance art, and has been critically recognized as a master photographer.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nSmith was raised in Texas, where he made his first film, Buzzards over Baghdad, in 1952. He moved to New York City in 1953.\\nThe most famous of Smith\\'s productions is Flaming Creatures (1963). The film, that first put camp on the map, is a satire of Hollywood B movies and tribute to actress Maria Montez, who starred in many such productions. However, authorities considered some scenes to be pornographic. Copies of the movie were confiscated at the premiere, and it was subsequently banned from public view. Despite not being viewable, the movie gained some anti-heroic notoriety when footage was screened during Congressional hearings and right-wing politician Strom Thurmond mentioned it in anti-porn speeches.\\nSmith\\'s next movie Normal Love (aka Normal Fantasy, Exotic Landlordism of Crab Lagoon, and The Great Pasty Triumph) (1963–1964) was the only work in Smith\\'s oeuvre with an almost conventional length (120 mins.), and featured multiple underground stars, including Mario Montez, Diane di Prima, Tiny Tim, Francis Francine, Beverly Grant, John Vaccaro, and others. The rest of his productions consists mainly of short movies, many never screened in a cinema, but featured in performances and constantly re-edited to fit the stage needs (including Normal Love).\\nAfter his last completed film, No President (1967), (Smith’s follow-up film, Sinbad In the Rented World (1972–1984) was never completed) he created small intermedia performance and experimental theatre work until his death on September 25, 1989, from AIDS-related pneumonia. Smith produced many theatrical mini-productions, often using slide projectors, in his loft and in art space settings such as Artists Space and Colab\\'s The Times Square Show. Descriptors of lobsters as greedy landlords dominate, along with crabs, Atlantis, 1950s exotica music, and camp-glamorous North African costumes. A pungent odor of burning incense and marijuana often perfumed the performances.\\nApart from appearing in his own work, Smith worked as an actor. He played the lead in Andy Warhol\\'s unfinished film Batman Dracula, Ken Jacobs\\'s Blonde Cobra, and appeared in several theater productions by Robert Wilson.\\nSmith also worked as a photographer and founded the Hyperbole Photographic Studio in New York City. In 1962, he released The Beautiful Book, a collection of pictures of New York artists, that was re-published in facsimile by Granary Books in 2001. As a draftsman, his posters, hand written scripts and drawing-notes superimpose a very eccentric personal imagery onto the traditional language of theater. \\nIn 1978, Sylvère Lotringer conducted a 13-page interview with Smith (with photos) in Columbia University\\'s philosophy department publication of Semiotext(e). It was collected in 2013 in Schizo-Culture: The Event, The Book. In 2014, it was released as a limited-ledition vinyl picture disc by Semiotext(e). \\nIn 1987, Smith was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.\\n\\n\\n== Estate ==\\nIn 1989, New York performance artist Penny Arcade tried to salvage Smith\\'s work from his apartment after his long bout with AIDS and subsequent death. Arcade attempted to preserve the apartment as Smith had transformed it – an elaborate stage set for his never-to-be-filmed epic Sinbad in a Rented World – as a museum dedicated to Jack Smith and his work. This effort failed.\\nUntil recently, Smith\\'s archive was co-managed by Arcade, alongside the film historian J. Hoberman via their corporation, The Plaster Foundation, Inc. Within ten years of Smith\\'s death, the Foundation, operating largely without funding but through donations and good will, was able to restore all of Smith\\'s films, create a major retrospective curated by Edward Leffingwell at PS 1, the Contemporary Arts Museum, now part of MoMA, put his films back into international distribution, and publish several books on Jack Smith and his work.\\nIn January 2004, the New York Surrogate\\'s Court ordered Hoberman and Arcade to return Smith\\'s archive to his legal heir, estranged, surviving sister Sue Slater. Hoberman and Arcade fought to dismiss Slater\\'s claim, arguing that she abandoned Jack\\'s apartment and its contents; the Plaster Foundation created the archive and took possession of the work only after 14 years of repeated, documented attempts at communication with her. In a six-minute trial, Judge Eve Preminger rejected the Foundation\\'s argument and awarded the archive to Slater.\\nBy October 2006, the foundation still refused to surrender Smith\\'s archive to the estate, claiming money owed them for expenses associated with managing the archive—and hoping Smith\\'s work would be bought by an appropriate public institution that could safeguard his legacy and keep the works in the public eye. According to curator Jerry Tartaglia, the dispute was resolved as of 2008, with the purchase of Smith\\'s estate by the Gladstone Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nSmith was one of the first proponents of the aesthetics which came to be known as \\'camp\\' and \\'trash\\', using no-budget means of production (e.g. using discarded color reversal film stock) to create a visual cosmos heavily influenced by Hollywood kitsch, orientalism and with Flaming Creatures created drag culture as it is currently known. Smith was heavily involved with John Vaccaro, founder of The Playhouse of the Ridiculous, whose disregard for conventional theater practice deeply influenced Smith\\'s ideas about performance art. In turn, Vaccaro was deeply influenced by Smith\\'s aesthetics. It was Vaccaro who introduced Smith to glitter and in 1966 and 1967, Smith created costumes for Vaccaro\\'s Playhouse of The Ridiculous. Smith\\'s style influenced the film work of Andy Warhol as well as the early work of John Waters.  While all three were part of the 1960s gay arts movement, Vaccaro and Smith disputed the idea that their sexual orientation was responsible for their art.\\nIn 1992, performer Ron Vawter recreated Smith\\'s performance \"What\\'s Underground about Marshmallows\" in Roy Cohn/Jack Smith which he presented in a live performance and which was later released as a film directed by Jill Godmilow and produced by Jonathan Demme.\\nPlaywright Richard Foreman was influenced by Smith.\\nTony Conrad produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled  56 Ludlow Street that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964.\\nIn 2017, Jerry Tartaglia directed a documentary called Escape from Rented Island: The Lost Paradise of Jack Smith which is a film essay concerning the works of Jack Smith, aimed at the artist\\'s most devoted followers.\\nIn 2009, Germany\\'s  Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art staged Five Flaming Days in a Rented World, a festival and conference on Smith\\'s work. The event included several commissioned short films in tribute to Smith\\'s films, the most noted of which was Guy Maddin\\'s The Little White Cloud That Cried.\\n\\n\\n== Selected filmography ==\\nBy Jack Smith\\n1952: Buzzards Over Baghdad\\n1961: Scotch Tape\\n1963: Flaming Creatures (b/w, 46 minutes)\\n1963: Normal Love (120 minutes)\\n1967: No President (a/k/a The Kidnapping of Wendell Willkie by The Love Bandit, ca. minutes)\\nWith Jack Smith as actor\\n1960: in Ken Jacobs\\'s Little Stabs at Happiness\\n1963: in Jacobs\\'s Blonde Cobra\\n1963: in Ron Rice\\'s Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man\\n1963: in Rice\\'s Chumlum\\n1965: in Andy Warhol\\'s Camp\\n1966: in Warhol\\'s Hedy (a/k/a Hedy the Shoplifter) starring Mario Montez and Mary Woronov\\n1971: in John Lennon and Yoko Ono\\'s Up Your Legs Forever\\n1974: in Ted Gershunny\\'s Silent Night, Bloody Night starring Mary Woronov, Patrick O\\'Neal, John Carradine, Candy Darling, Ondine, and Tally Brown\\n1989: in Ari Roussimoff (Frankenhooker)\\'s Shadows in the City\\nAbout Jack Smith\\n2006: Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis, documentary written, directed, and co-produced by Mary Jordan\\n\\n\\n== Books by Smith ==\\n1960 16 Immortal Photos\\n1962 The Beautiful Book (dead language press, republished 2001 Granary Books)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nHoberman, J., On Jack Smith\\'s \\'Flaming Creatures\\' (And Other Secret-Flix of Cinemaroc), New York: Granary Books, 2001\\nJ.

       "  'Dennis Oppenheim (September 6, 1938 – January 21, 2011) was an American conceptual artist, performance artist, earth artist, sculptor and photographer. Dennis Oppenheim\\'s early artistic practice is an epistemological questioning about the nature of art, the making of art and the definition of art: a meta-art that arose when strategies of the Minimalists were expanded to focus on site and context. As well as an aesthetic agenda, the work progressed from perceptions of the physical properties of the gallery to the social and political context, largely taking the form of permanent public sculpture in the last two decades of a highly prolific career, whose diversity could exasperate his critics.\\n\\n\\n== Biography and Education ==\\nOppenheim\\'s father was a Russian immigrant and his mother a native of California. Oppenheim was born in Electric City, Washington, while his father was working as an engineer  on the Grand Coulee Dam. Soon after, his family returned to their home in the San Francisco Bay area. Oppenheim attended Richmond High school.\\n\\nHe later attended the California College of Arts and Crafts, where he met his first wife, Karen Marie Cackett. Oppenheim and Cackett moved to Honolulu, where he taught at the University of Hawaii and they had their first child, Kristin, in 1959. In 1962  they had their second child, Erik. In 1964, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and an MFA from Stanford University in Palo Alto in 1965. He moved to New York in 1966 and taught art at a nursery school in Northport and a junior high school in Smithtown, Long Island, while working toward his first one-person New York show in 1968 when he was 30 years old. His third child, Chandra, was born to Phyllis Jalbert that year. In 1972, Oppenheim was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. \\nIn 1981 he married the sculptor Alice Aycock who remained a close friend. In 1998 he married Amy Plumb and they remained married.  Oppenheim occupied a live-work loft in Tribeca from 1967 until his death from cancer on January 21, 2011, aged 72.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nConceptual works:\\nExecuted in New York, Paris and Amsterdam and documented in photography, the series Indentations (1968)  consisted of the removal of objects, exposing the impression of each object at that location. Viewing Stations (1967) were built as platforms for observing land vistas, suggesting an embodied notion of vision. The artist presents the base as the art itself, a viewer becomes an object to be looked at, a conceptual reversal.\\nEarthworks:\\nSocial systems were overlaid on natural systems in Oppenheim\\'s earthworks. In Annual Rings (1968) the schemata of lines depicting the annual growth of a tree was mapped by plowing snow on opposite sides of St. John\\'s River, the boundary of the US and Canada. The earthwork relates geo-political boundaries, time zones, growth of the tree and entropic decay in a seminal site-specific work.\\nBody – performance works:\\nOppenheim\\'s body art grew out of his awareness of his own body when executing earthworks. In these works, the artist\\'s body was both the subject and the object, providing the opportunity to work on a surface not exterior to the self, giving total control over the artwork. These body art actions were later assimilated into the canon of performance art. For Reading Position for Second Degree Burn (1970) Oppenheim lay on a beach for five hours with an open book on his chest, exposing himself to the sun. Oppenheim describes the piece as a corporeal enactment of painting, going on to state \"I could feel the act of becoming red.\".\\nGenetic works:\\nA series of works were made in collaboration with Oppenheim\\'s children, whom he saw as extensions of himself. In a diptych titled 2- Stage Transfer Drawing. (Advancing to a Future State)., he makes a drawing on a wall at the same time that his son attempts to replicate the drawing on his father\\'s back, a procedure reversed in 2- Stage Transfer Drawing. (Returning to a Past State). (1971) when he replicates the drawing on his son\\'s back. Recorded in still photography, film and videotape,  the performances were first exhibited as floor-to ceiling loop film projections. He also collaborated with his first wife in Forming Sounds (1972) and referred to his father, David Oppenheim, in the works Polarties (1972) and Identity Transfer (1970).\\nFilm / video installations:\\nOppenheim began to produce installation art in the early seventies. These works were often autobiographical. In Recall  (1974), a video monitor is an installation component, positioned in front of a pan of turpentine. The monitor shows a close up of Oppenheim\\'s mouth as he verbalizes a stream-of-consciousness monologue induced by the smell, on his experiences in art school in the fifties.\\nPost-performance- biographical works:\\nIn a series of eight works Oppenheim called \"post-performance,\" the artist spoke through his surrogate performance figures  about the end of the avant-garde, his own art-making, in dialogue as opposites or as in Theme for a Major Hit (1974) acted under motorized control to a rock song with his lyrics, \"It ain’t what you do, it’s what makes you do it,\" recorded by a band of Soho artists. Reflecting the underlying content of the post-modern, it is an \"analysis of its own origins\" with an \"awareness of its vulnerability.\"\\nMachineworks:\\nIn the early eighties, room size sculptural installations took the form of factories and machines to visualize the genesis of an artwork before it becomes form. Final Stroke- Project for a Glass Factory (1981) analogized thinking patterns as moving parts. Vacuum cleaners and powered heaters activated raw material through sieves, troughs, stacks and vents, as the stages of processing in the production of ideas. The machines became projection structures for fireworks, producing thought lines in the air, as in Newton Discovering Gravity (1984).\\nSculpture:\\nWhile he continues to use sound, light and motion in the sculptural work in the late eighties, the imagery includes ordinary objects in different scales or as a collision of objects. In several works, animals appear. A group of taxidermy deer produce flames from the tips of their antlers, in Digestion. Gypsum Gypsies. (1989).\\nPublic Sculpture:\\nOppenheim experimented with titled and cantilevered form in Device to Root Out Evil (1997). Included as part of the Venice Biennale, it uses hand blown Venetian glass on the country church\\'s roof and steeple.  In 1999,  a version using translucent corrugated fiberglass was installed as a permanent work in Palma de Mallorca. In the commissioned public work that followed,  Oppenheim integrated the function of the building or the site in the work itself. Jump and Twist (1999) is an industrial, anthropologic work in three parts;  on the plaza, through the facade of the building and suspended from the atrium\\'s ceiling as translucent rotating form. The public work Light Chamber (2011) at the Justice Center in Denver, is an open room with translucent walls derived from the petals of many flowers.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEngagement (sculpture)\\nRadiant Fountains, Houston, Texas\\nStill Dancing\\nFormula compound, Fattoria di Celle- Collezione Gori, Pistoia\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Flower Arrangement for Bruce Nauman, Multiples, Inc., New York, 1970.\\nGlusberg, Christian, Nine Days with Dennis Oppenheim, El Centro de Arte y Comunicación, Buenos Aires, 1971.\\nFels, Mathias, Dennis Oppenheim, 1967-1971, Paris, 1972.\\nPluchart, Francois, Dennis Oppenheim 1967-1971, Mathias Felds and Editions CEDIC, Paris, 1972.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Dennis Oppenheim, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 1974.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Indentations, Gallerie Yaki Kornblit, Amsterdam, 1974.\\nVan Tieghem, Jean-Pierre, Dennis Oppenheim, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, 1975.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Dennis Oppenheim Proposals 1967-1974, Lebeer-Hossman, Brussels, 1975.\\nParent, Alain (ed.), Dennis Oppenheim: Retrospective - Works 1967-1977, Musee d’Art Contemporain, Montreal, 1978.\\nAmmann, Jean-Christophe, Dennis Oppenheim, Kunsthalle Basel, Basel, 1979.\\nWeyl, Dr. Martin, Dennis Oppenheim, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1979.\\nInstitute of Contemporary Art, Machineworks, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, 1981.\\nTeicher, Hendel and Poser, Steven,  Dennis Oppenheim, Galerie Eric Franck, Geneva, 1981.\\nFox, Howard N., Metaphor, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 1982.\\nGuralnik, Nehema, Factories, Fireworks, 1979-1989, The Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984.\\nJoyaux, Alain G., Dennis Oppenheim: Accelerator for Evil Thoughts, Ball State University Art Gallery, Muncie, 1985.\\nCollins, Tricia and Milazzo, Richard, Dennis Oppenheim Recent Works, Liverpool Gallery, Brussels, 1990.\\nKolokotronis, Yannis and Reid, Calvin, Dennis Oppenheim Retrospective 1970-1990, Pierides Museum of Contemporary Art,  Athens, 1990.\\nG.

       "  'Jennifer Bartlett (née Losch; March 14, 1941 – July 25, 2022) was an American artist and novelist. She was best known for paintings and prints that combine the system-based aesthetic of conceptual art with the painterly approach of Neo-Expressionism. Many of her pieces were executed on small, square, enamel-coated steel plates that are combined in grid formations to create very large works.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBartlett was born Jennifer Losch in 1941 in Long Beach, California, one of four children. Her father owned a construction company, and her mother was a fashion illustrator who left the field to raise her children. She grew up in the suburbs of Long Beach, close enough to the ocean that she developed an affinity for water, which would reappear in her mature work. She attended Mills College in Oakland, California, graduating with a BA in 1963. During her college years, she met Elizabeth Murray, who became a lifelong friend. She then moved to New Haven to study at the Yale School of Art and Architecture at a time when minimalism was the dominant style. She studied with Josef Albers, Jack Tworkov, Jim Dine, and Richard Serra, receiving her MFA in 1965.\\nBartlett described the experience of study at Yale as her broadest influence: \"I\\'d walked into my life\". In a 2005 interview with the painter Elizabeth Murray, she gave this list of things that she said had been on her mind as a first-year art student:\\n\\nBeing an artist, Ed Bartlett, Bach cello suites, Cézanne, getting into graduate school, getting to New York, Albert Camus, James Joyce. I’d drawn constantly since childhood: large drawings of every creature alive in the ocean; Spanish missions with Indians camping in the foreground, in the background Spanish men throwing cowhides over a cliff to a waiting ship; hundreds of Cinderellas on five-by-eight pads, all alike but with varying hair color and dresses.\\nAmong Bartlett\\'s early influences were Arshile Gorky, Piet Mondrian, and Sol LeWitt; particularly LeWitt\\'s Paragraphs on Conceptual Art.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nBartlett was best known for her paintings and prints in which familiar subjects — ranging from houses and gardens to oceans and skies — are executed in a style that combines elements of both representational and abstract art; indeed, she commented that she did not accept a distinction between figurative and abstract art. LeWitt’s “rules” for conceptual art and the exactitude of LeWitt’s method and his definitive use of programmatic strategies and forms is manifest in her life-long devotion to geometric form. She often worked in serial form or created polyptychs, and she frequently devised rule systems that guide the variations within a given group of works, requiring viewers to focus on \"perception, on process, on the effect of shifting perspective— and on the leaps that take place in our minds no matter how rational we may think we are\". In the late 1960s, influenced by the work of John Cage, she started bringing chance elements into her work.\\nHer realistic works favored mundane subjects, such as modest houses. Her installations often consisted of multiple canvases as well as three dimensional objects. House with Open Door from 1988, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, consists of an oil paint on canvas diptych and the same house constructed out of wood. The Dallas Museum of Art, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Tate Modern, and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City) are among the public collections holding her work.\\nMost critics perceived Bartlett\\'s work as inventive, energetic, wide-ranging, and ambitious, and she was considered one of the two best painters of the postminimalism generation. One writer noted that a central paradox of her work was that Bartlett took the controlled, rationalist grid often favored by conceptual artists and used it to release an evocative torrent of imagery that was much in common with the Neo-Expressionist work of the 1980s. A few critics found her work shallow, overly focused on surface, and weakened by its eclecticism. She had several retrospectives and survey exhibitions, the first in 1985 originating at the Brooklyn Museum (New York) and with more recent ones in 2011 at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and 2014 at the Parrish Art Museum (New York).\\n\\n\\n=== Early experimental work ===\\nEarly on, Bartlett made a number of three-dimensional works that she subjected to extreme conditions such as freezing and smashing. She also realized that she wanted something to draw on that was erasable but gridded like the graph paper that she and many other conceptual artists were using at the time. She came up with what is now one of her signature materials: foot-square steel plates with a plain white baked enamel surface on which was silkscreened a quarter-inch grid. She had these fabricated in large quantities, and later worked with other sizes as well.\\n\\n\\n=== Rhapsody (1975–76) ===\\nWith her earliest well-known work, Rhapsody, Bartlett reinvented the mural form for Conceptual art. Rhapsody is a painting executed on 987 foot-square enamel-coated steel tiles arranged in a grid 7 plates tall by roughly 142 wide, extending across multiple walls. The subject matter consists of variations on what Bartlett felt were the basic elements of art: four universal motifs (house, tree, ocean, mountain), geometric forms (line, circle, triangle, square), and color (25 shades). The seven sections are entitled \"Introduction\", \"Mountain\", \"Line\", \"House\", \"Tree\", \"Shape\", and \"Ocean\".\\nRhapsody has been called an \"extended portable mural\" and a \"post-painting painting\" that \"took the American art world by storm\". According to critic Roberta Smith, Rhapsody is an epic achievement that brought together elements of photorealism, geometric abstraction, and pattern painting while also prefiguring 1980s Neo-Expressionism. It is so large that Bartlett commented that she never saw the piece as a whole until its first public exhibition. Bartlett said of Rhapsody that it \"opened the wall up instead of closing it down. It looks bigger than it really is.... It’s my way of making edgeless paintings.\" It has been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art (New York).\\nSubsequent series such as In the Garden and Amagansett have become more painterly while still retaining their systematizing rigor.\\n\\n\\n=== At Sea, Japan (1980) ===\\nIn 1980, Bartlett began to work on a complex print project in collaboration with master printers in Japan. The result was At Sea, Japan, a waterscape printed on paper whose 6 panels span 8 feet in width. The image is built up from 96 screenprints and 86 color woodcuts.\\n\\n\\n=== In the Garden series (1979–83) ===\\nIn the Garden is a series of over 200 drawings (and later paintings and prints) that all take as their subject the garden behind a villa in Nice, France, where Bartlett stayed in the winter of 1979–1980. Bartlett used a few major motifs — an old swimming pool, a statue of a urinating boy, a row of cypresses — to explore perspective, scale, and changing light conditions. The drawings range from pencil sketches to pastels and gouaches executed in a range of styles, and many are diptychs or triptychs. She later made her backyard garden in Brooklyn, New York, the focus of a similar series of diptychs.\\n\\n\\n=== Sea Wall (1985) ===\\nWith Sea Wall, Bartlett brought together oil painting and sculpture. The piece consists of a large painting of houses and boats on a dark ground, in front of which are placed sculptural versions of those same objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Digital painting (1987) ===\\nIn 1987, the BBC invited Bartlett as one of six international artists, including David Hockney and Sidney Nolan, to work digitally on a Quantel Paintbox. The series was called Painting With Light and, though she was at first reluctant, she grew to enjoy her first attempt at digital painting and discussed the implications of this new medium as she worked.\\n\\n\\n=== Air: 24 Hours (1991-92) ===\\nA collaboration between Bartlett and the fiction writer Deborah Eisenberg, Air: 24 Hours first appeared as a book of 24 paintings by Bartlett with accompanying text by Eisenberg. Each paintings shows a scene in Bartlett\\'s house at a particular hour of the day.\\n\\n\\n=== Amagansett series (2007–08) ===\\nAround 2004, she began including fragments of text — phrases, bits of dialogue, dreams — in some of her paintings. Amagansett is a series of oil paintings that take the ocean, skies, and seaside landscapes of Long Island as their subject. They are painted in a distinctive cross-hatched style in a limited palette favoring blues, greens, grays, and browns. Some pieces are diptychs in which Bartlett explores the shifts visible in a landscape between two moments of time or seen from two slightly different angles of view.\\n\\n\\n=== History of the universe: A novel ===\\nAfter her first novel, Cleopatra I-IV (1971), published by The Poetry Project in an edition of 300 copies (unpaginated and unbound), Bartlett\\'s massive experimental novel History of the universe: A novel was published by Nimbus Books on January 1, 1985. Like Andy Warhol\\'s later published The Andy Warhol Diaries (1989) it is a book that mixes, with a surfeit of detail, stream-of-consciousness and traditional narrative; recounting a series of Bartlett\\'s memories, impressions, and descriptions of family, art world individuals and conversations. Like Cleopatra I-IV, the book is divided into sections, and each is marked by one of Bartlett’s photograph. It is both banal and colorful: sometimes representational, sometimes abstract. In it, Bartlett alternates between a first- and third-person voice to address and recount the subjects of family, marriage, career, friends, and death. Peter Schjeldahl, Ron Padgett, and other members of the poetry community that gathered at St. Mark\\'s Church in-the-Bowery encouraged Bartlett to join them in reading her precise inventory of personal events and habits aloud, and she found an audience receptive to her literary minimal art work there.\\nAn excerpt from History of the universe: A novel was included in the 2014 book Jennifer Bartlett: History of the Universe (1970-2011) that was published by Parrish Art Museum containing texts by Klaus Ottmann and Terrie Sultan.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nIn 1981, Bartlett created Swimmers Atlanta, a 200-foot multimedia mural for the Federal Building in Atlanta, Georgia. Thereafter she completed commissions for Volvo, AT&T, Saatchi & Saatchi, Information Sciences Institute, and Battery Park.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and death ==\\nAfter marrying medical student Ed Bartlett in 1964, she commuted between the Soho district of New York City and New Haven, where she taught at the University of Connecticut.\\nFollowing her 1972 divorce, Bartlett moved to New York City full-time and began teaching at the School of Visual Arts. In 1983, she married German actor Mathieu Carrière with whom she had a daughter, Alice Carrière, the author of the Spiegel & Grau memoir Everything/Nothing/Someone that recounts the author\\'s challenging life in their household. They divorced in the early 1990s. She lived in both New York City and Paris. As of 2014, she resided full-time in Amagansett on Long Island. Bartlett died from acute myeloid leukemia at her home in Amagansett on July 25, 2022, aged 81.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\nPaula Cooper Gallery, New York, 1976.

       "  'Lari George Pittman (born 1952 in Glendale, California) is a Colombian-American contemporary artist and painter. Pittman is an Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Painting and Drawing at the UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nPittman\\'s American father met his Colombian mother while the former was working abroad in the latter\\'s homeland. At the age of five, Pittman\\'s family moved back to Colombia, returning to California in 1963. In contrast to his childhood in Colombia, Pittman\\'s experience in the United States keeps him alert to \"the overwhelming hatred that is exhibited by the American population and through actual legislation against homosexuals.”\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nPittman received his MFA from Cal Arts in 1976 studying with Elizabeth Murray, Vija Celmins, and Miriam Schapiro. Afterwards, Pittman began working in the interior design business with Angelo Donghia, where he worked with music and entertainment clientele. Pittman was the singular male student within the Feminist program in the 1970s. During this time, Pittman began showing his work at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. Pittman asserts, \"One of my strongest memories from those years is of how patterning and color were so relentlessly gendered.\" He continues, \"I’d show somebody a textile or something, and a common answer would be, no, that’s too feminine, or it’s too masculine. Always within the framework of gender construction binaries. In 1985, Pittman was shot at his Silver Lake apartment and recovered from gun shot wounds.[1] This experience would forever impact his work and further his determination to paint large-scale.\\nIn David Pagel\\'s interview with Pittman, he concludes that Pittman\\'s paintings include \"imaginary organic forms, runaway arrows, and arabesques, transform ornamentation into a contemporary narrative of life and death, love and sex.\" He also believes \"Pittman\\'s operatic pictures propose that the world\\'s complexity does not override passion, sincerity, and individuality.\" When talking about his own work, Pittman states: \"at times, I purposefully orchestrate the work so that you do have that comfortable laughter when looking at it—it\\'s full-hearted and enjoyable internally—but it\\'s also a laughter linked to nervousness. And that\\'s the laughter I particularly like cultivating, parlor laughter, where there\\'s always the subtext of conversation going on, but everyone is very agreeable.\" Mayer Russ of Architectural Digest writes, \"Pittman’s obsessions—political and personal trauma, with an incisive eye on the lamentable state of current world affairs—is a welcome tonic to the glittery, Koons-and-Hirst-variety theatrics that often dominate contemporary art discourse.\" Pittman targets colonial dismemberment in his newest body of work.\\nAs a Professor of Painting at UCLA, Pittman mentored artists including Elliott Hundley, Lauren Silva, and Toba Khedoori. In 1998, he was part of the search committee that selected Ann Philbin as director of the Hammer Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1996 Pittman\\'s work was the subject of a mid career survey at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Describing his work as \"encumbered, tethered, tied-in, [and[ chaperoned,” Leah Olmen of ArtNews asserts Pittman\\'s work is about \"History and sexuality, memory and experience, philosophy and poetry, humor and rage share the stage in exquisite imbalance, the whole a manifesto against reductionism and an endorsement.[2]\" \\nIn 2019, Pittman had a solo retrospective show titled \"Declaration of Independence\" at the Hammer Museum in Westwood, Los Angeles. Christopher Knight of the Los Angeles Times recalled, \"For the first time, the Hammer has turned over virtually all its main exhibition spaces to a comprehensive survey of a single artist — a testament to his singular achievement and broad influence.\" Knight expands, \"Pittman’s work is often discussed in terms of its radical commitments to adornment. Spectacular gardens, decorated eggs, blue and white porcelains, Dutch still lifes and Spanish interiors, ladies and gentlemen taking tea in drawing rooms — the list is endless, stuffed into jam-packed paintings.\"[3]\\nPittman\\'s first solo show in South Korea opened at Lehmann Maupin in Seoul.\\nPittman is currently represented by Regen Projects in Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nPittman is included in several esteemed art collections including the Eli and Edythe Broad collection at The Broad in Los Angeles, United States.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPittman considers himself to be an atheist. At CalArts, Pittman met his partner Roy Dowell with whom he has lived ever since. Together Pittman and Dowell lived in a 1952 Richard Neutra home called the \"Dorothy Serulnic Residence\" and an adjacent Michael Maltzan home. Flea (musician) of the Red Hot Chili Peppers purchased the property in 2019 for $4.25 million. The Neutra house is currently on the market again. Pittman currently resides in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nBoard Memberships:\\n\\n2015 – 2018: MOCA, Los Angeles, Artist on the Board of Trustees\\n2008 – present: Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, Board of Overseers\\nAwards:\\n\\n2013 International Association of Art Critics United States Exhibition Award Winner\\n2012 International Association of Art Critics Award\\n2011 Hammer Museum Gala in the Garden Honoree\\n2006 Rhode Island School of Design Honorary Doctorate\\n2004 Pacific Design Center Stars of Design 2004 Award for Art\\n2002 Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture Skowhegan Medal\\n1999/2000 Flintridge Foundation Award for Visual Artists\\n1993 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant in Painting\\n1990 California Arts Council Arts Fellowship Grant in Painting\\n1989 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant in Painting\\n1989 J.

       "  'Martha Rosler (born 1943) is an American artist. She is a conceptual artist who works in photography and photo text, video, installation, sculpture, and performance, as well as writing about art and culture. Rosler\\'s work is centered on everyday life and the public sphere, often with an eye to women\\'s experience. Recurrent concerns are the media and war, as well as architecture and the built environment, from housing and homelessness to places of passage and systems of transport.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, in 1943, Rosler spent formative years in California, from 1968 to 1980, first in north San Diego county and then in San Francisco. She has also lived and taught in Canada. She graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, as well as Brooklyn College (1965) and the University of California, San Diego (1974). She has lived in New York City since 1981.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nRosler\\'s work and writing have been widely influential. Her media of choice have included photomontage and photo-text, as well as video, sculpture, and installation. Rosler has lectured extensively, nationally and internationally. She taught photography and media, as well as photo and video history and critical studies, at Rutgers University, in new Brunswick, New Jersey, where she was a professor for thirty years, attaining the rank of Professor II. She also  taught at the Städelschule in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as serving as visiting professor at the University of California\\'s San Diego and Irvine campuses, and elsewhere.\\nSolo exhibitions of Rosler\\'s work have been organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1977), Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston (1987), Museum of Modern Art in Oxford (1990), The New Museum in collaboration with the International Center of Photography in New York, (1998–2000), Sprengel Hannover Museum (2005), Institute of Contemporary Arts in London (2006), University of Rennes (2006), and Portikus in Frankfurt (2008). Her work has also been included in major group exhibitions such as Whitney Biennial (1979, 1983, 1987, and 1990), Documenta 7 and 12 (1982 and 2007), Havana Biennale (1986), Venice Biennale (2003), Liverpool Biennial (2004), Taipei Biennial (2004) and Skulptur Projekte (2007).\\nRosler serves in an advisory capacity to the departments of education at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Center for Urban Pedagogy (all New York City). She is a board member of the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at the New School, New York and an Advisory Board board member of the Center for Urban Pedagogy. She has also served on the board of directors of the Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture at Columbia University, New York, and she is a former member of the boards of directors of the Association for Independent Video and Film and the Media Alliance, and a former trustee of the Van Alen Center, all in New York City. Since the early 1980s she has been a regular lecturer at the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York, where she was formerly a faculty member.\\nRosler is known for her writing as well as her art work in various media. She has published over 16 books of her artwork and her critical essays on art, photography, and cultural matters, some of which have appeared as well in translation. Her essays have been widely published, anthologized, and translated. She was interviewed for the film !Women Art Revolution.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Semiotics of the Kitchen ===\\nSemiotics of the Kitchen (1974/75) is a pioneering work of feminist video art in which, parodying early television cooking shows, Rosler demonstrates some hand tools of the kitchen in alphabetical order. As her gestures begin to veer into an unexpected and possibly alarming direction, the character eventually dispenses with the tools and uses her body as a kind of semaphore system. Rosler has suggested that this darkly humorous work is meant to challenge social expectations of women in regard to food production and, more broadly, the role of language in determining these expectations. The issue the work calls up is whether the woman can be said to \"speak herself.\"\\n\"Even though it was obscure looking (on purpose) and inelegant (on purpose) and unedited (on purpose), it began to look like a naïf moment of production that was the best that could be done at the time. In other words, it was seen as a pioneering work because of its low quality of production\".\\n\\n\\n=== Other video work ===\\nFurther video works include Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained (1977), Losing: A Conversation with the Parents (1977), and Martha Rosler Reads Vogue (1982), with Paper Tiger Television; Domination and the Everyday (1980) and Born to Be Sold: Martha Rosler Reads the Strange Case of Baby $/M (1988), also with Paper Tiger Television. Many of her video works address geopolitics and power, including Secrets From the Street: No Disclosure (1980);  A Simple Case for Torture, or How to Sleep at Night (1983); If It\\'s Too Bad to be True, It Could Be DISINFORMATION (1985); the three-channel installation Global Taste: A Meal in Three Courses (1985); and Because This Is Britain (2014), and many others.\\nRosler employs performance-based narratives and symbolic images of mass media to disrupt viewers\\' expectations. Rosler says, \"Video itself \\'isn\\'t innocent:\\' Yet video lets me construct, using a variety of fictional narrative forms, \\'decoys\\' engaged in a dialectic with commercial TV.\"\\nThese concepts are emphasized in such works as Semiotics of the Kitchen, in which a static camera is focused on a woman in a kitchen who interacts with kitchen utensils, naming and demonstrating their uses in odd gestures, speaking to the expectations of women in certain domestic spaces.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography and photomontage ===\\nRosler\\'s photo/text work The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems (1974/75) is considered a seminal work in conceptual and postmodern photographic practice. The series of 45 black and white prints pair photos of storefronts on the Bowery, at the time of the work\\'s making a famous \"skid row\" of New York City, with photographs of mostly metaphoric groups of texts referring to drunks and drunken behavior. The photos are displayed in a grid to accentuate the anti-expressionist nature of the work and the inherent limitation of both visual and linguistic systems to describe human experiences and social problems.\\nSome of Rosler\\'s best-known works are collected under the title House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home (c. 1967–72). This is a series of photomontages that juxtapose aspirational scenes of middle-class homes, mostly interiors, with documentary photos from the Vietnam War. These images were primarily distributed as photocopied fliers in and around antiwar marches and occasionally in \"underground\" newspapers. They continue the tradition of political photomontage in the style of John Heartfield and Hannah Höch as well as pop art such as Richard Hamilton\\'s Just what is it that makes today\\'s homes so different, so appealing?. Both the war images and the domestic interiors were collected from issues of Life Magazine and similar mass-market magazines, but these works sought to reunite the two apparently separate worlds to imply connections between the industries of war and the industries of the home and their common understandings .\\nRosler revisited this series in 2004 and 2008 by producing new images based on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, under the title  House Beautiful: Bringing the War Home, New Series. Sensing that her original series had become accepted and aestheticized, her new series was designed to address continuities that paralleled the Vietnam War and unsettle complacent viewers. Rosler described the \"rah rah\" attitude of American media and politics that reminded her of the political manipulations of the past.\\nAlso widely noted are her series of photomontages entitled Body Beautiful, or Beauty Knows No Pain (c. 1965–72), addressing the photographic representation of women and domesticity. These works slightly preceded the antiwar montages and spurred their making.\\nMany of these works are concerned with the geopolitics of entitlements and dispossession. Her writing and photographic series on roads, the system of air transport, and urban undergrounds (subways or metros) join her other works addressing urban planning and architecture, from housing to homelessness and the built environment, and places of passage and transportation.\\nMuch of her work also focus antiwar and feminist ideologies in the 1960s and 2000s. Rosler\\'s art inserts domestic and private themes into the public sphere in order to make political, social, and instructional critiques.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nRosler has had numerous solo exhibitions. A retrospective of her work, “Positions in the Life World” (1998–2000) was shown in five European cities (Birmingham, England; Vienna; Lyon/Villeurbanne; Barcelona; and  Rotterdam) and, concurrently, at the International Center of Photography and the New Museum of Contemporary Art (both in New York). She has recently been the subject of an extensive retrospective exhibition at the Galleria Civica d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea (GAM), in Turin. In 2006 her work was the subject of solo exhibitions at the University of Rennes and in 2007 at the Worcester Museum of Art. Her work has been seen in the Venice Biennale of 2003; the Liverpool Biennial, the Taipei Biennial (both 2004), and the Singapore Biennale (2011), and the Thessaloniki Biènnale (2017); as well as many major international survey shows, including the \"Documenta\" exhibitions in Kassel, Germany, of 1982 and 2007, Skulptur Projekte Münster in 2007, and several Whitney Biennials.\\nIn 1989, in lieu of a solo exhibition at the Dia Art Foundation in New York City, Rosler organized the project \"If You Lived Here...\", in which over 50 artists, film- and video producers, photographers, architects, planners, homeless people, squatters, activist groups, and schoolchildren addressed contested living situations, architecture, planning, and utopian visions, in three separate exhibitions, four public forums, and associated events. In 2009, an archive exhibition based on this project, \"If You Lived Here Still,\" opened at e-flux\\'s gallery in New York and then traveled (2010) to Casco Office for Art Design and Theory, in Utrecht, Netherlands, and to La Virreina Centre de la Imatge in Barcelona. Following the problematic addressed by these exhibitions, Rosler together with the urbanist Miguel Robles-Durán worked on an urban installation project in Hamburg, Germany, called We Promise!(2015), which confronts the conflicting promises of urban regeneration projects in Europe via a set of public posters on the street and in public transport. Versions of the 1989 show have been mounted in many locations on several continents.\\n\\nIn 2016, a projected year-long project at the New Foundation Seattle and in the Seattle, under the rubric \"Housing Is a Human Right,\" was to reprise all three exhibitions of the Dia exhibition of 1989, \"If You Lived Here...\"—but focusing especially on contemporary Seattle. However, the New Foundation, which had also made her the first recipient of its award to a distinguished female artist working in the field of social justice, abruptly ceased public operations after the completion of the first two shows. Subsequently, also in 2016, Rosler organized an exhibition in New York that included much of the Dia and Seattle material but focused on New York City. Working with her Seattle curator Yoko Ott, and Miguel Robles-Durán, and with the assistance of Dan Wiley, who had worked with her on organizing key components of the 1989 show, as well as many others, Rosler put on the exhibition If you can\\'t afford to live here, mo-o-ove! at Mitchell-Innes and Nash, renamed as a public space, the Temporary Office of Urban Disturbances. Four public forums on the issues of art and gentrification and the privatization of housing were also held.\\nAt the Utopia Station exhibition at the Venice Biennale of 2003, Rosler worked with about 30 of her students from Stockholm and Copenhagen, as well as a small, far-flung internet group of former workshop participants, \\'the Fleas\\', and her graduate students from her video seminar at Yale, to produce a mini-pavilion, newly designed and built but purposely left unfinished, as well as large banners, and a collective newspaper, as well as many projects, both individual and collective, exploring utopian schemes and communities and their political and social ramifications. Rosler has also produced two tours of historical sites, one in Hamburg (1993) and one in Liverpool (2004), in conjunction with curated art projects. At the Frieze Art Fair (London) of 2005, she conducted a tour of this temporary site from its siting and construction to all aspects of its labor, including customer service, food service, toilets, VIP lounges, publicity, maintenance, and security.\\nHer solo show Meta-Monumental Garage Sale was held at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York in November 2012, revisiting a series of exhibitions she had held in 1973 in San Diego and 1977 in San Francisco that centered on the American garage sale. The sale, held in MoMA\\'s atrium was inspired by Rosler\\'s interest in garage sales, a social form of small-scale, local—small town and suburban—commerce largely organized and frequented by women, which she first experienced when she moved from New York, where such phenomena were then completely unknown, to Southern California.\\nAt the request of museum curators, she restaged such sales in several European art locales and in New York City starting in 1999, culminating in the Fair Trade Garage Sale at the Museum of Cultural History in Basel, in conjunction with the 2010 Basel Art Fair, and then at MoMA in 2012.\\nThe 2012 “Meta-Monumental Garage Sale” at MoMA offered over 14,000 items, including Rosler\\'s accumulated holdings—many of which were rolled over from previous iterations of this work—and items solicited from museum employees and the public. There were also two issues of a newspaper and two public discussions, one of which included a psychic, assessing questions of value and meaning.  The work, since its inception in 1973, was intended to invoke questions of art and value, as the events were always held in museums and noncommercial galleries, or in spaces associated with them, as well as to call attention to the liminal domestic spaces that women regularly negotiate economically.\\n\\nStarting in November 2005, e-flux sponsored the \"Martha Rosler Library,\" a reading room in which over 7,500 volumes from her private collection were made available as a public resource in venues in and around art institutions, schools, and libraries. The collection started at e-flux\\'s New York gallery and then traveled to the Frankfurter Kunstverein in Germany; to Antwerp\\'s NICC, an artist-run space, in conjunction with the MuHKA (Museum of Contemporary Art); to United Nations Plaza School in Berlin; to the Institut National de L\\'Histoire de L\\'Art in Paris; to Stills in Edinburgh; to John Moore\\'s Art School in Liverpool; and to the Gallery at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, before being retired. At the \"Martha Rosler Library,\" visitors could sit and read or make free photocopies. Other projects, such as reading groups and public readings, were organized locally in conjunction with the project.\\nIn 2018, the Jewish Museum in New York City presented Martha Rosler: Irrespective, a survey exhibition showcasing the artist\\'s five decades-long practice, featuring installations, photographic series, sculpture, and video from the 1960s to the present.\\n\\n\\n== Activist vs. political art ==\\nWhile Rosler\\'s primary impetus for her solo exhibition at the Dia Center for the Arts was to expose the invisibility of homelessness and urban policies that conspire to conceal the socially underprivileged, one of the few critiques of the show was that it did little to actually lessen the homelessness problem in America. When asked the difference between making activist work as an artist, and being an activist Rosler said, \"To be an activist you probably have to be working intensively with a specific community and a specific issue or set of issues, specific outcomes...I am an artist. I make art. And I was also a full-time professor. Activism is an on-going process, and it’s true that I worked with activists on that project, but one thing is certain: activists don’t expect intractable problems to be solved by an exhibition or a political campaign and certainly not in six months.\" Rosler is known to make work around a plethora of social and political idea, from civil rights, to anti-war efforts, to women\\'s rights. Given this information and her definition of an \"activist,\" it is safe to assume Rosler is an artist making activist work, or political work. Rosler is a professor and frequently collaborates with her students, bringing forward a new generation of political art, with different backgrounds on the subject.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nRosler\\'s son is the graphic novelist Josh Neufeld; they have collaborated on a number of projects.\\n\\n\\n== Published works ==\\nMartha Rosler\\'s essays have been published widely in catalogues, magazines, such as Artforum, Afterimage, Quaderns, and Grey Room, and edited collections, including Women Artists at the Millennium (October Books/MIT, 2006) among many others. She has produced numerous other \"word works\" and photo/text publications; now exploring cookery in a mock dialogue between Julia Child and Craig Claiborne, now analyzing imagery of women in Russia or exploring responses to repression, crisis, and war. Her 1981 essay, \"In, Around, and Afterthoughts (on documentary photography),\" has been widely cited, republished, and translated and is credited with a great role in dismantling the myths of photographic disinterestedness and in generating a discussion about the importance of institutional and discursive framing in determining photographic meaning.\\nRosler has published sixteen books of photography, art, and writing. Among them are Decoys and Disruptions: Selected Essays 1975-2001 (MIT Press, 2004), the photo books Passionate Signals (Cantz, 2005), In the Place of the Public: Observations of a Frequent Flyer (Cantz, 1997), and Rights of Passage (NYFA, 1995). If You Lived Here (Free Press, 1991) discusses and supplements her Dia project on housing, homelessness, and urban life. Several books, in English and other languages, were published in 2006, including a 25-year edition of 3 Works (Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design) with a new foreword by Rosler. The collection Imágenes Públicas, Spanish translations of some essays and video scripts, was published in 2007. Her book Culture Class, on gentrification, artists, art institutions, and the Culture Class theory, was published by e-flux and Sternberg Press in 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Videography ==\\nA Budding Gourmet 1974, 17:45 min, b&w, sound\\nSemiotics of the Kitchen 1975, 6:09 min, b&w, sound\\nLosing: A Conversation with the Parents 1977, 18:39 min, color, sound\\nThe East Is Red, The West Is Bending 1977, 19:57 min, color, sound\\nFrom the PTA, the High School and the City of Del Mar 1977, 6:58 minutes\\nVital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained 1977, 39:20 min, color, sound\\nTravelling Garage Sale 1977, 30 min, b&w\\nDomination and the Everyday 1978, 32:07 min, color, sound\\nSecrets From the Street: No Disclosure 1980, 12:20 min, color, sound\\nOptimism/Pessimism: Constructing a Life 1981, 44 minutes\\nWatchwords of the Eighties 1981-82, 62 minutes\\nMartha Rosler Reads Vogue 1982, 25:45 min, color, sound\\nA Simple Case for Torture, or How to Sleep at Night 1983, 62 minutes\\nFascination with the (Game of the) Exploding (Historical) Hollow Leg 1983, 58:16 min, color, sound\\nIf it\\'s too bad to be true, it could be Disinformation 1985, 16:26 min, color, sound\\nGlobal Taste: A Meal in Three Courses 1985, 30 minutes, 3-channel installation\\nBorn to be Sold: Martha Rosler Reads the Strange Case of Baby $/M (with Paper Tiger Television) 1988, 35 min, color, sound\\nIn the Place of the Public: Airport Series 1990, 4 hrs, color, sound\\nGreenpoint: The Garden Spot of the World 1993, 19:24 minutes\\nHow Do We Know What Home Looks Like? 1993, 31 min, color, sound\\nSeattle: Hidden Histories 1991-95, 13 min, color, sound\\nChile on the Road to NAFTA 1997, 10 min, color, sound\\nPrototype (God Bless America) 2006, 1 minute\\nSemiotics of the Kitchen: An Audition 2011, 10:26 min, color, sound\\nBecause This Is Britain, 2014, 3 minutes\\nMuseums Will Eat Your Lunch, 2014, 3 minutes\\nPencicle of Praise, 2018, 12 minutes\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2005 Spectrum International Prize in Photography — accompanied by a retrospective, “If Not Now, When?” largely of photo and video works but also a garage sale, at the Sprengel Museum in Hanover and, on slightly smaller scale, at the Neue Gesellschaft der Bildende Kunst, or NGBK in Berlin.

       "  'John Angus Chamberlain (April 16, 1927 – December 21, 2011), was an American sculptor and filmmaker. At the time of his death he resided and worked on Shelter Island, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nBorn in Rochester, Indiana as the son of a saloonkeeper, Chamberlain was raised mostly by his grandmother after his parents divorced. He spent much of his youth in Chicago. After serving in the U.S. Navy from 1943 to 1946, he attended the Art Institute of Chicago (1951–52) and Black Mountain College (1955–56). At Black Mountain, he studied with the poets Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan, who were teaching there that semester. The following year, he moved to New York, where for the first time he created sculpture that included scrap-metal auto parts. Over the course of his prolific career, he had studios in New York, New Mexico, Florida, Connecticut, and finally Shelter Island.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nChamberlain is best known for creating sculptures from old automobiles (or parts of) that bring the Abstract Expressionist style of painting into three dimensions. He began by carving and modelling, but turned to working in metal in 1952 and welding 1953. By 1957, while staying with the painter Larry Rivers in Southampton, New York, he began to include scrap metal from cars with his sculpture Shortstop, and from 1959 onward he concentrated on sculpture built entirely of crushed automobile parts welded together. Far more than just another wrinkle on assemblage Shortstop and subsequent works completely reinvented modeling, casting, and volume, altering Marcel Duchamp\\'s notion of the readymade and using the car as both medium and tool. In 1962 Donald Judd wrote, \"The only reason Chamberlain is not the best American sculptor under forty is the incommensurability of \\'the best\\' which makes it arbitrary to say so.\"\\nBy the end of the 1960s, Chamberlain had replaced his signature materials initially with galvanized steel, then with mineral-coated Plexiglas, and finally with aluminum foil. In 1966, he began a series of sculptures made of rolled, folded, and tied urethane foam including sofas. After returning in the mid-1970s to metal as his primary material, Chamberlain limited himself to specific parts of the automobile (fenders, bumpers, or the chassis, for example). In 1973, two 300-pound metal pieces by Chamberlain were mistaken for junk and carted away as they sat outside a gallery warehouse in Chicago.\\nIn the early 1980s, Chamberlain moved to Sarasota, Florida, where an 18,000-square-foot warehouse studio on Cocoanut Avenue enabled him to work on a much grander scale than he previously had. Many of the subsequent works Chamberlain made in Florida revert to more volumetric, compact configurations, often aligned on a vertical axis. As seen in the so-called Giraffe series (circa 1982–83), for example, linear patterns cavort over multicolored surfaces—the results of sandblasting the metal, removing the paint, and exposing the raw surface beneath. In 1984, Chamberlain created the monumental American Tableau created for display on the Seagram Building\\'s plaza.\\nAssembling intricately cut, painted metal parts, Chamberlain made his first mask, A Good Head and a Half (1991), for a benefit auction for Victim Services in 1991, providing aid to victims of sexual assault. He continued to produce masks throughout the 1990s in his studio on Shelter Island, titling many of them with opus numbers.\\nChamberlain also made abstract colour paintings from 1963, and from 1967 he made several films, such as \"Wide Point\" (1968), and \"The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez\" (1968), filmed in Mexico with Warhol regulars Taylor Mead and Ultra Violet. He also made the film \"Black Cherry No-Cal\" (1971), a short black and white experimental film about a man and a woman that meet in Central Park on a bench. In the last decade of his life, the artist expanded his work to large-format photographs.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nChamberlain\\'s first major solo show was held at the Martha Jackson Gallery, New York, in 1960. His singular method of putting discarded automobile-body parts together led to his inclusion in the paradigmatic exhibition \"The Art of Assemblage\", at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961, where his work was shown alongside modern masters such as Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso. His works have since been exhibited around the world and have been included in the São Paulo Art Biennial (1961, 1994), the Whitney Biennial (1973, 1987) and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1982) and he has had over 100 solo shows, including Dia Art Foundation (1983); Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden and Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (1991); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1996); and Menil Collection, Houston (2009). Chamberlain represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1964. He had his first retrospective in 1971, at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. A second retrospective was organized in 1986 by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. From February 24 to May 13, 2012, shortly after the artist\\'s death, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum showcased \"John Chamberlain: Choices\", a comprehensive exhibition of the artist\\'s work. The exhibition examined the artist\\'s development over his sixty-year career, exploring the shifts in scale, materials, and techniques informed by the assemblage process that was central to his working method.\\n\\nA special exhibition of Chamberlain\\'s foam sculptures and photographs was on view at the Chinati Foundation in 2005–06. Chamberlain supposedly has a work of art on the moon in the Moon Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nCentre Pompidou, Paris\\nChinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas\\nDia:Beacon, Beacon\\nGalleria Nazionale d\\'Arte Moderna, Rome\\nHyde Collection, Glens Falls, NY\\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.\\nKunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland;\\nMenil Collection, Houston\\nMinneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis\\nModerna Museet, Stockholm\\nMuseum Brandhorst, Munich\\nMuseum Ludwig, Cologne\\nMuseum Moderner Kunst, Vienna\\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia\\nNelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City\\nSaint Louis Art Museum, St. Louis, Missouri\\nScottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale, Arizona\\nSolomon R.

If I feel so glad that a sculpture is here, and I don’t care who did it, then I figure it\\'s a good piece.\"\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2011, Chamberlain\\'s Nutcracker (1958) from the Allan Stone Estate sold at auction for $4.7 million, more than twice its high $1.8 million estimate and a record price for the artist at auction.\\nThe John Chamberlain Estate has been represented by Xavier Hufkens and Hauser & Wirth since 2019. Prior to that it was represented by Gagosian Gallery. The artist\\'s earlier gallery representation includes The Pace Gallery from 1987 to 2005 and Leo Castelli from 1962 to 1987.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1977 Chamberlain married Lorraine Belcher in New York City on New Year\\'s Eve. They maintained residences and studios in NYC, Essex, Connecticut, and Sarasota, FL. They divorced in 1986. John had three sons by his former wife, Elaine, who died in New Mexico after their divorce, in the early 70s. The boys, Angus, Jesse and Duncan then moved to NYC to live with their father. His middle son, Jesse, died in Sag Harbor in 1998.\\nIn 1996, Chamberlain married art executive Prudence Fairweather, Dan Flavin\\'s former assistant. In 2000, he built a 72-by-82-foot studio on Shelter Island.\\nIn her memoirs, Warhol superstar Ultra Violet claims that during the 1960s she and Chamberlain shared a romantic relationship which ended when first he crashed her car, then when told that she had become pregnant by him he responded, “That’s your problem”.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nJohn Chamberlain received a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in both 1966 and 1977.\\n1990: Member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York\\n1993: Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture by the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine\\n1993: Lifetime Achievement Award in Contemporary Sculpture from the International Sculpture Center, Hamilton, NJ\\n1997: The National Arts Club Artists Award, New York\\n1999: Distinction in Sculpture Honor from the Sculpture Center, New York.\\n2006: Elected into the National Academy of Design\\n2010: Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa, from the College for Creative Studies, Detroit\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\"Wide Point\" (1968)\\n\"The Secret Life of Hernando Cortez\" (1968)\\n\"Black Cherry No-Cal\" (1971)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBusch, Julia M., \"A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s\" (The Art Alliance Press: Philadelphia; Associated University Presses: London, 1974) ISBN 0-87982-007-1\\nGetsy, David J. \"Immoderate Couplings: Transformations and Genders in John Chamberlain\\'s work,\" chapter 2 of Abstract Bodies: Sixties Sculpture in the Expanded Field of Gender, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2015), 96–145.

       "  'Deborah Kay Butterfield (born May 7, 1949) is an American sculptor. Along with her artist-husband John Buck, she divides her time between a farm in Bozeman, Montana, and studio space in Hawaii.  She is known for her sculptures of horses made from found objects, like metal, and especially pieces of wood.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nBorn the same day as the 75th running of the Kentucky Derby (May 7, 1949), Butterfield partly credits that birthdate as an inspiration for her subject matter; she has also said that she would have preferred to work in the female form, but that her mentor Manuel Neri dominated that form. Instead, she chose to create metaphorical self-portraits using images of horses. Gradually, the horses themselves became her primary theme. Butterfield earned her bachelor\\'s degree (1972) at the University of California, Davis with Honors and a Master of Fine Arts (1973) at the University of California, Davis, where she met her husband, artist John Buck, whom she married in 1974.\\nButterfield taught sculpture at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and at Montana State University – Bozeman from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. Since 1986, Butterfield has spent her summers in Montana, and winters in Hawaii.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nButterfield\\'s work has been exhibited widely and there is demand among art collectors for her sculptures. Her earliest works from the mid-1970s were made from sticks and natural detritus gathered on her property in Bozeman, Montana. \"The materials and images were meant to suggest that the horses were both figures and ground, merging external world with the subject.\" She began crafting horses out of scrap metal and cast bronze in the early 1980s. She would sculpt a piece using wood and other materials fastened together with wire, then photograph the piece from all angles so as to be able to reassemble the piece in metal.\\n\\n\\n=== Horses as a metaphor ===\\nButterfield has said, \"I first used the horse images as a metaphorical substitute for myself – it was a way of doing a self-portrait one step removed from the specificity of Deborah Butterfield.\" She also said, \"These first horses were huge plaster mares whose presence was extremely gentle calm. They were at rest, and in complete opposition to the raging warhorse (stallion) that represents most equine sculpture. The next series of horses was made of mud and sticks and suggested that its forms were left clotted together after the river flooded and subsided. the pieces were dark and almost sinister, reflecting the realization that I was perhaps more like the warhorse than the quiet mares. For me they represented the process of attitudes and feelings taking shape after a flood of experiences. The materials and images were to suggest that the horses were both figure and ground, merging external world with the subject.\"\\nAs critic Grace Glueck wrote in The New York Times in 2004, \"By now Deborah Butterfield\\'s skeletal horses, fashioned of found wood, metal and other detritus, are familiar to almost a generation of gallerygoers. Yet they still have a freshness, which comes from the artist\\'s regard for them as individuals. In fact, training, riding and bonding with horses, as she does at her Montana farm, she thinks of them as personifications of herself ... They seem to express the very spirit of equine existence.\"\\nButterfield has said that her horses are intended to make a feminist statement. \"I wanted to do these big, beautiful mares that were as strong and imposing as stallions but capable of creation and nourishing life. It was a very personal feminist statement.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Representation and exhibitions ===\\nDeborah Butterfield is represented by Marlborough Gallery, New York; Anglim Gilbert Gallery, San Francisco; Greg Kucera Gallery, Seattle, Washington; LA Louver, Los Angeles, California; and Zolla/Lieberman Gallery, Chicago, Illinois. The Honolulu Museum of Art, the Rockwell Museum (Corning, N.Y), the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City), Madison Museum of Contemporary Art (Madison, WI), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City), the Delaware Art Museum, the Boise Art Museum, the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art (St. Joseph, Missouri) and the Neuberger Museum of Art (Purchase, New York) are among the public collections holding work by Deborah Butterfield. Also, the Rockford Art Museum, Rockford, Illinois. Butterfield was featured in the 1989 Women\\'s Art show, Women\\'s Work: the Montana Women\\'s Centennial Art Survey Exhibition 1889–1989. In the Pappajohn Sculpture Park at Des Moines, Iowa, Deborah Butterfield has 2 sculptures installed there, which are Juno (1989) and Ancient Forest (2009).\\n\\n\\n== Materials and construction ==\\nInitially constructing her sculptures using natural materials such as mud, clay and sticks in the 1970s, Butterfield has since moved to using metal in her work. In 1979, she began using reclaimed materials such as found steel and scrap metal. For the past 20 plus years, Butterfield has been using bronze casts of \"stray, downed pieces of wood.\"  Butterfield carefully selects pieces of wood that outline the form and gesture of the horse. The wood pieces are then cast in bronze, burning the wood away.\\nReferencing her materials, Butterfield has said, \"When I walk past my pile of junk, I am inspired by the things I see. It has to do with finding and identifying objects of interest that I can work with. Working with junk is a way of recognizing a quality of line and appropriating it to my sculpture.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nHorses in art\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nDeborah Butterfield, at Smithsonian American Art Museum',\n",

       "  'Agnes Bernice Martin  (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was an American abstract painter known for her minimalist style and abstract expressionism. Born in Canada, she moved to the United States in 1931, where she pursued higher education and became a U.S. citizen in 1950. Martin\\'s artistic journey began in New York City, where she immersed herself in modern art and developed a deep interest in abstraction. Despite often being labeled a minimalist, she identified more with abstract expressionism. Her work has been defined as an \"essay in discretion, inwardness and silence.\"\\nGrowing up in rural Canada and influenced by the New Mexico desert, Martin\\'s art was characterized by serene compositions featuring grids and lines. Her works were predominantly monochromatic, employing subtle colors like black, white, and brown. Martin\\'s minimalist approach conveyed tranquility and spirituality, and her paintings often carried positive names reflective of her philosophy.\\nHer career included numerous exhibitions, totaling over 85 solo shows, and participation in major events such as the Venice Biennale and Documenta. Martin\\'s work earned recognition for its unique contribution to contemporary art, and she received awards like the National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998. She was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2004.\\nDespite personal struggles with schizophrenia, Martin\\'s dedication to her art persisted, and her legacy continues to inspire contemporary artists. Documentaries and films have explored her life and work, shedding light on her artistic process and impact. Beyond the art world, her influence extends to popular culture, as seen in a Google doodle and a song dedicated to her. Martin\\'s artistic vision, blending minimalism and spirituality, remains an enduring and influential force in the realm of abstract art.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nAgnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in Macklin, Saskatchewan, one of four children. From 1919, she grew up in Vancouver.:\\u200a237\\u200a She moved to the United States in 1931 to help her pregnant sister, Maribel, in Bellingham, Washington.:29 She preferred American higher education and became an American citizen in 1950. Martin studied at Western Washington University College of Education, Bellingham, Washington, prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from Teachers College, Columbia University. It was while living in New York that Martin became interested in modern art and was exposed to artists such as Arshile Gorky (1904–1948), Adolph Gottlieb (1903–1974), and Joan Miró (1893–1983). She took a multitude of studio classes at Teachers College and began to seriously consider a career as an artist.\\nIn 1947, she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in Taos, New Mexico.:\\u200a237\\u200a After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life. A few years following graduation, Martin matriculated at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, where she also taught art courses before returning to Columbia University to earn her M.A. (1952) in modern art. She moved to New York City in 1957 and lived in a loft in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan.:\\u200a238\\u200a The Coenties Slip was also home to several other artists and their studios. There was a strong sense of community although each had their own practices and artistic temperaments. The Coenties Slip was also a haven for the queer community in the 1960s. It is speculated that Martin was romantically involved with the artist Lenore Tawney (1907–2007) during this time. A pioneer of her time, Agnes Martin never publicly expressed her sexuality, but has been described as a \"closeted homosexual.\" The 2018 biography Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon describes several romantic relationships between Martin and other women, including the dealer Betty Parsons. She often employed a feminist lens when she critiqued fellow artists\\' work. Jaleh Mansoor, an art historian, stated that Martin was \"too engaged in a feminist relation to practice, perhaps, to objectify and label it as such.\" It is worth noting that Martin herself did not identify as a feminist and even once told a New Yorker journalist in an interview that she thought \"the women\\'s movement had failed.\"\\nMartin was publicly known to have schizophrenia, although it was undocumented until 1962. She even once opted for electric shock therapy for treatment at Bellevue Hospital in New York. Martin did have the support of her friends from the Coenties Slip, who came together after one of her episodes to enlist the help of a respected psychiatrist, who as an art collector was a friend to the community. However, her struggle was a largely private and individual one, and the full effect of the mental illness on her life is unknown.\\nMartin left New York City abruptly in 1967, disappearing from the art world to live alone. After eighteen months on the road camping across both Canada and the western United States, Martin settled in Mesa Portales, near Cuba, New Mexico (1968-1977). She rented a 50-acre property and lived a simple life in an adobe home that she built for herself, adding four other buildings over the years. During these years she did not paint, until 1971, when she was approached by curator Douglas Crimp who was interested in organizing her first solo non-commercial exhibition. Subsequently, Martin started to write and lecture at various universities about her work. Slowly Martin\\'s interest in painting renewed as well. She approached Pace Gallery about her work and the gallery\\'s founder Arne Glimcher (b.1938) became her lifelong dealer. Finally able to own her own property, she moved to Galisteo, New Mexico, where she lived until 1993.:\\u200a240\\u200a She built an adobe home there too, still choosing an austere lifestyle. Although she still preferred solitude and lived alone, Martin was more active in the art world, travelling extensively and showing in Canada, the United States, and internationally. In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in Taos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in 2004.:\\u200a242\\u200a\\nMany of her paintings bear positive names such as Happy Holiday (1999) and I Love the Whole World (2000). In an interview in 1989, discussing her life and her painting, Agnes Martin said, \"Beauty and perfection are the same. They never occur without happiness.\"\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nHer work is most closely associated with Taos, with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert environment of New Mexico. However, there is also a strong influence from her young upbringing in rural Canada, particularly the vast and quiet Saskatchewan prairies. While she described herself as an American painter, she never forgot her Canadian roots, returning there after she left New York in 1967, as well as during her extensive travels in the 1970s. Some of Martin\\'s early works have been described as simplified farmer\\'s fields, and Martin herself left her work open to interpretation encouraging comparisons of her unembellished, monochromatic canvases to landscapes.\\nShe moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, and Lenore Tawney. Barnett Newman actively promoted Martin\\'s work, and helped install Martin\\'s exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late 1950s. Another close friend and mentor was Ad Reinhardt. In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend Lenore Tawney\\'s first solo exhibition, the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist. In 1967, Martin famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt, the demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist Chryssa whom Martin had dated off and on throughout the 1960s. In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalized to control symptoms of schizophrenia which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia: on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan\\'s Bellevue Hospital. After Martin left New York, she drove around the western US and Canada, settling in Cuba, New Mexico for a few years (1968-1977), then settling in Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993).:\\u200a240–242\\u200a In both New Mexico homes, she built adobe brick structures herself. She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events that brought other artists into the public eye. She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a log cabin she would use as her studio. That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from 1975 they were exhibited regularly.\\nIn 1976 she made her first film, Gabriel, a 78-minute landscape film which features a little boy going for a walk. A second movie, Captivity, was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town dump.\\nAccording to a filmed interview with her that was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building\\'s imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years. Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The Drawing Center (traveling to other museums as well) in 2005 – 3x abstraction – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin\\'s work. The 2018 biography Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon was the first book to explore Martin\\'s relationship with women and her early life in substantial detail and was written in collaboration with Martin\\'s family and friends.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic style ==\\nIn addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin\\'s early works included biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and 1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her first steps into abstraction.\\nMartin praised Mark Rothko for having \"reached zero so that nothing could stand in the way of truth\". Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality. Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early 1960s, she created 6 × 6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids. In the 1966 exhibition Systemic Painting at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Martin\\'s grids were therefore celebrated as examples of Minimalist art and were hung among works by artists including Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, and Donald Judd. While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the artist\\'s hand; she shied away from intellectualism, favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially Taoist. Because of her work\\'s added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she preferred to be classified as an abstract expressionist.\\nMartin worked in only black, white, and brown before moving to New Mexico. The last painting before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, Trumpet, marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint. In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, On a Clear Day. During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light. Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72 × 72 square paintings to 60 × 60 inches and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color. Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In Untitled No. 4 (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic paint blended with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist. In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.\\nLawrence Alloway noted that Martin is in the first generation of the Abstract Expressionism style, which is significant and \"shows her commitment to exalted subject matter\" and her ability to \"transform it into the language of painting which gives the works their aura of silent dignity.\"\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin\\'s work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and two retrospectives including the survey, Agnes Martin, organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1974–1990 organized by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the Menil Collection, Houston, mounted Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond. That same year, the Harwood Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico, Pandora, organized Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001, as well as a symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.\\nIn addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale (1997, 1980, 1976), the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1977), and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women\\'s Caucus for Art of the College Art Association (2005); Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992); the Governor\\'s Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor Gary Johnson, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the National Medal of Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton and the National Endowment for the Arts (1998); the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement by the College Art Association (1998); the Golden Lion for Contribution to Contemporary Art at the Venice Biennale (1997); the Oskar Kokoschka Prize awarded by the Austrian government (1992); the Alexej von Jawlensky Prize awarded by the city of Wiesbaden, Germany (1991); and election to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York (1989).\\nExhibitions continue to be mounted since her death in 2004, including Agnes Martin: Closing the Circle, Early and Late Feb 10, 2006 – Mar 04, 2006 at Pace Gallery. Other exhibitions have been held in New York, Zurich, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cambridge (England), Aspen, Albuquerque, British Columbia in Canada. In 2012, The Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, University of New Mexico launched a museum wide exhibition titled, Agnes Martin Before the Grid in honor of her centennial year. This exhibit was the first to focus on the work and life of Martin prior to 1960. The exhibit focused on many, never seen before, works Martin created at Columbia, Coentis Slip and early years in New Mexico. It was also the first to consider Martins struggle with mental health, sexuality and Martin\\'s important relationship with Ad Reinhardt. In 2015, Tate Modern ran a retrospective of her life and career from the 1950s until her last work in 2004, which will travel to other museums after the show in London. At the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Martin was featured in the exhibition Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014 which examined the two generations of Minimalist art side by side, from October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included Anne Truitt, Mary Corse, and contemporary artists Shirazeh Houshiary and Tomma Abts.\\nShe was also featured in White on the White: Color, Scene, and Space in Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. From October 2015 through April 2016, Martin was exhibited in Opening the Box: Unpacking Minimalism at The George Economou Collection in Athens, Greece alongside Dan Flavin and Donald Judd.  From 2015 to 2017 she had numerous solo exhibitions, some being at the Aspen Art Museum in Aspen Colorado, Tate Modern in London, K20, Kunstsammlung Nordhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in the Upper East Side, at the Palace of Governors, The New Mexico Museum of History in Santa Fe. She has featured in the ongoing exhibition Intuitive Progression at the Fisher Landau Center for Art in Long Island City, New York from February 2017 to August 2017.\\nIn 2016, a retrospective exhibition of her works from the 1950s through 2004 was presented at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2016 she was also featured in the Dansaekhwa and Minimalism Exhibition at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles and earlier in the year in the show titled Aspects of Minimalism: Selections from East End Collections at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York.\\nShe was also featured in Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction at The Museum of Modern Art in Midtown, New York which shined a light on women artists who worked post World War II and before the start of the Feminist movement. The exhibition went from April 2017 to August 2017 and featured Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, and Joan Mitchell, Lygia Clark, Gego, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Eva Hesse.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMartin\\'s work can be found in major public collections in the United States, including the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, NM; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; The Chinati Foundation, Marfa, TX; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art; The Menil Collection, Houston, TX; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines, IA, among others. Her work is on \"long-term view\" and part of the permanent holdings of Dia Art Foundation, Beacon, New York.\\nInternational holdings of Martin\\'s work include the Tate, London and Magasin 3 Stockholm Konsthall, Stockholm, Sweden.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2007, Martin\\'s Loving Love (2000) was sold for $2.95 million at Christie\\'s, New York. In 2015, Untitled #7 (1984), a white acrylic painting with geometric pencil lines, sold for $4.2 million at Phillips in New York. In 2016, her Orange Grove sold at auction for $13.7 million, the same year as the Guggenheim held a retrospective of her work.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nMartin became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher.\\nHer image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.\\nIn 1994, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, part of the University of New Mexico, announced that it would renovate its Pueblo-revival building and dedicate one wing to Martin\\'s work. The gallery was designed according to the artist\\'s wishes in order to accommodate Martin\\'s gift of seven large untitled paintings made between 1993 and 1994. An Albuquerque architectural firm, Kells & Craig, designed the octagonal gallery with an oculus installed overhead, and four yellow Donald Judd benches placed directly under the oculus. The gift of the paintings and gallery\\'s design and construction were negotiated and overseen by Robert M. Ellis, the Harwood\\'s director at the time and a close friend of Martin\\'s. Today, the Agnes Martin Gallery attracts visitors from all over the world and has been compared by scholars to the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence (Matisse Chapel), Corbusier\\'s Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, and the Rothko Chapel in Houston. \\n\\n\\n=== Films about Martin ===\\n2000: Thomas Luechinger: On a Clear Day – Agnes Martin.

       "  'Will Barnet (May 25, 1911 – November 13, 2012) was an American artist known for his paintings, watercolors, drawings, and prints depicting the human figure and animals, both in casual scenes of daily life and in transcendent dreamlike worlds.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBorn in 1911 in Beverly, Massachusetts, Barnet knew by the age of ten that he wanted to be an artist.  As a student, he studied with Philip Leslie Hale at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and viewed first-hand John Singer Sargent at work on the murals of the Boston Public Library.  In 1930, Barnet studied at the Art Students League of New York, with Stuart Davis and Charles Locke, beginning his long association with the school.  Here he concentrated on painting as well as printmaking, and, in 1936, he became the official printer for the Art Students League. There, he later instructed students in the graphic arts at the school and taught alongside the likes of Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Robert Beverly Hale and Richard Pousette-Dart.  Barnet taught and mentored the early careers of artists Audrey Flack, Emily Mason, Brett Bigbee, Lois Dodd, Raymond A. Whyte and Jim Rosenquist. Barnet influenced a generation of artists, including James Rosenquist, Knox Martin, Emil Milan, Paul Jenkins, Ethel Fisher and Cy Twombly. Barnet continued his love of teaching with positions at the Cooper Union, at Yale University, and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He was represented by the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York City. Barnet had three sons, Peter, Richard, and Todd Barnet, by his first wife Mary Sinclair.  Barnet later married Elena Barnet, with whom he had a daughter, Ona Barnet.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nA longtime resident of the National Arts Club, Barnet died in New York City on November 13, 2012, at the age of 101.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\nBarnett\\'s works span the various \"movements\" of their era, from his early social realist work to his final signature style of clean lines and carefully placed volumes of solid color in a kind of minimalist representational approach. His work is concerned with humanity, yet at his core he always remained a formalist, cerebral in his approach to the elements that make up a good picture. In his interviews he articulated his well thought out principles regarding color use, composition and subject matter, in a professorial manner reflecting the theoretical acumen he brought to his teaching. Like many American painters of his generation he was digesting the evolving trends in Europe and integrating the new visual vocabulary into his American style while remaining universal, referencing his own personal history with images of his wife, his daughter, and their family pets.  As James Thomas Flexner wrote, Barnet\\'s work \"makes us experience the interplay between the personal and the universal.\"  While remaining representational, the simple elegance of the figures and their flat surfaces reflect his exploration with abstraction.\\nWill\\'s artistic output spans eighty years. Few artists, other than Picasso or Monet, can claim such a long continuous period of inspired art making, nor the logical progression of moving through artistic phases: in the 1930s he was a social realist, in the 1940s a Modernist, in the 1950s an Abstract Expressionist and in the 1960s and onward he settled on a representational minimalism honed from the refinement of his earlier explorations. His early work is decidedly social realist, with sullen portraits done in dark tonalities that suggest both the struggle of the depression era and the hope in the simple love of family life. He moves out of this phase with the improving economy and in the 1940s adds vibrant color and more abstract figures, suggesting a lifting of the depression era malaise. He was a key figure in the 1940s New York movement called Indian Space Painting, artists who based their abstract and semi-abstract work on Native American art; a striking movement which had a handful of practitioners (notably Steve Wheeler). In the 1950s he evolved into his form of Abstract Expressionism, which is more studied and less \"spontaneous\", creating formally pleasing paintings of well ordered shape and color.  His later work returned entirely to figurative painting. He is probably best known for these enigmatic portraits of family, made from the 1970s onwards, notably the Silent Seasons series, which contrasts his earlier works edginess and brooding contemplation that becomes more remarkable when compared with the more placid and pretty works which followed his second marriage. Within his oeuvre one can chart the evolution of American painting trends of which Will was on the forefront, as well as the joys and vicissitudes of his personal life, with his first marriage ending in divorce and his second marriage providing a more stable family life, reflected in the harmonious compositions of domestic tranquility of his later work.\\nHis works have entered virtually every major public collection in the United States, including, the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Jewish Museum, the Art Museum of Southeast Texas, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  He has been the subject of over eighty solo exhibitions held at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of American Art of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the National Academy of Design Museum, the National Museum of American Art, Montclair Art Museum, the Boca Raton Museum of Art, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and the Worcester Art Museum, among others.  Barnett was also an active member of the Society of American Graphic Artists.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\nBarnet was the recipient of numerous awards, including the first Artist\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award Medal given on the occasion of the National Academy of Design\\'s 175th anniversary, the College Art Association\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award, the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Art\\'s Lippincott Prize, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters\\' Childe Hassam Prize.  He was an elected member of the National Academy of Design, the Century Association, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.  Barnet defined an artistic career that, in the words of Robert Doty, \"has always gone beyond the limitations of modern art because his work affirms a faith in life.\" Barnet was awarded the 2011 National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. In 2012, France conferred the insignia of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters on Barnet.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nWill Barnet Biography\\nWill Barnet: A Timeless World - Portland Museum of Art\\nPainting at 99 - The New York Times\\nWill Barnet, Artist Video produced by NJTV\\nWill Barnet, legendary artist with strong Maine ties, dies at 101\\nWill Barnet, Visionary Artist, Dies at 101 The New York Times',\n",
       "  'Lucian Michael Freud  (; 8 December 1922 – 20 July 2011) was a British painter and draughtsman, specialising in figurative art, and is known as one of the foremost 20th-century English portraitists. He was born in Berlin, the son of Jewish architect Ernst L. Freud and the grandson of Sigmund Freud. Freud got his first name \"Lucian\" from his mother in memory of the ancient writer Lucian of Samosata. His family moved to England in 1933, when he was 10 years old, to escape the rise of Nazism. He became a British naturalized citizen in 1939. From 1942 to 1943 he attended Goldsmiths\\' College, London. He served at sea with the British Merchant Navy during the Second World War.\\nHis early career as a painter was influenced by surrealism, but by the early 1950s his often stark and alienated paintings tended towards realism. Freud was an intensely private and guarded man, and his paintings, completed over a 60-year career, are mostly of friends and family. They are generally sombre and thickly impastoed, often set in unsettling interiors and urban landscapes. The works are noted for their psychological penetration and often discomforting examination of the relationship between artist and model. Freud worked from life studies, and was known for asking for extended and punishing sittings from his models.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and family ==\\nBorn in Berlin on 8 December 1922 (the city was then part of the Weimar Republic), Freud was the son of a German Jewish mother, Lucie (née Brasch), and an Austrian Jewish father, Ernst L. Freud, an architect who was the fourth child of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Lucian, the second of their three boys, was the elder brother of the broadcaster, writer and politician Clement Freud (thus uncle of Emma and Matthew Freud) and the younger brother of Stephan Gabriel Freud.\\nThe family emigrated to St John\\'s Wood, London, in 1933 to escape the rise of Nazism. Lucian became a British subject in 1939, having attended Dartington Hall School in Totnes, Devon, and later Bryanston School, for a year before being expelled owing to disruptive behaviour.\\n\\n\\n== Early career ==\\nFreud briefly studied at the Central School of Art in London, and from 1939 to 1942 with greater success at Cedric Morris\\' East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, relocated in 1940 to Benton End, a house near Hadleigh, Suffolk. He also attended Goldsmiths\\' College, part of the University of London, in 1942–43. He served as a merchant seaman in an Atlantic convoy in 1941 before being invalided out of the service in 1942. As a result of his poor physical condition he was able, unlike his two brothers, to avoid conscription. \\nIn 1943, the poet and editor Meary James Thurairajah Tambimuttu commissioned the young artist to illustrate a book of poems by Nicholas Moore entitled The Glass Tower. It was published the following year by Editions Poetry London and comprised, among other drawings, a stuffed zebra and a palm tree. Both subjects reappeared in The Painter\\'s Room on display at Freud\\'s first solo exhibition in 1944 at the Lefevre Gallery. In the summer of 1946, he travelled to Paris before continuing to Greece for several months to visit John Craxton. In the early fifties he was a frequent visitor to Dublin where he would share Patrick Swift\\'s studio. He remained a Londoner for the rest of his life.\\nFreud was one of a number of figurative artists who were later characterised by artist R. B. Kitaj as a group named the \"School of London\". This group was a loose collection of individual artists who knew each other, some intimately, and were working in London at the same time in the figurative style. The group was active contemporaneously with the boom years of abstract painting and in contrast to abstract expressionism. Major figures in the group included Freud, Kitaj, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Michael Andrews, Leon Kossoff, Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, and Reginald Gray. Freud was a visiting tutor at the Slade School of Fine Art of University College London from 1949 to 1954.\\n\\n\\n== Mature style ==\\n\\nFreud\\'s early paintings, which are mostly very small, are often associated with German Expressionism (an influence he tended to deny) and Surrealism in depicting people, plants and animals in unusual juxtapositions. Some very early works anticipate the varied flesh tones of his mature style, for example Cedric Morris (1940, National Museum of Wales), but after the end of the war he developed a thinly painted very precise linear style with muted colours, best known in his self-portrait Man with a Thistle (1946, Tate) and a series of large-eyed portraits of his first wife, Kitty Garman, such as Girl with a Kitten (1947, Tate). These were painted with tiny sable brushes and evoke Early Netherlandish painting.\\nFrom the 1950s, he began to focus on portraiture, often nudes (though his first full-length nude was not painted until 1966), to the almost complete exclusion of everything else, and by the middle of the decade developed a much more free style using large hog\\'s-hair brushes, concentrating on the texture and colour of flesh, and much thicker paint, including impasto. Girl with a White Dog, 1951–1952, (Tate) is an example of a transitional work in this process, sharing many characteristics with paintings before and after it, with relatively tight brushwork and a middling size and viewpoint. He would often clean his brush after each stroke when painting flesh, so that the colour remained constantly variable. He also started to paint standing up, which continued until old age, when he switched to a high chair. The colours of non-flesh areas in these paintings are typically muted, while the flesh becomes increasingly highly and variably coloured. By about 1960, Freud had established the style that he would use, with some changes, for the rest of his career. The later portraits often use an over life-size scale, but are of mostly relatively small heads or in half-lengths. Later portraits are often much larger. In his late career he often followed a portrait by producing an etching of the subject in a different pose, drawing directly onto the plate, with the sitter in his view.\\nFreud\\'s portraits often depict only the sitter, sometimes sprawled naked on the floor or on a bed or alternatively juxtaposed with something else, as in Girl With a White Dog (1951–52) and Naked Man With Rat (1977–78). According to Edward Chaney, \"The distinctive, recumbent manner in which Freud poses so many of his sitters suggests the conscious or unconscious influence both of his grandfather\\'s psychoanalytical couch and of the Egyptian mummy, his dreaming figures, clothed or nude, staring into space until (if ever) brought back to health and/or consciousness. The particular application of this supine pose to freaks, friends, wives, mistresses, dogs, daughters and mother alike (the latter regularly depicted after her suicide attempt and eventually, literally mummy-like in death), tends to support this hypothesis.\"\\nThe use of animals in his compositions is widespread, and often he features a pet and its owner. Other examples of portraits with both animals and people in Freud\\'s work include Guy and Speck (1980–81), Eli and David (2005–06) and Double Portrait (1985–86). He had a special passion for horses, having enjoyed riding at school in Dartington, where he sometimes slept in the stables. His portraits solely of horses include Grey Gelding (2003), Skewbald Mare (2004), and Mare Eating Hay (2006). Wilting houseplants feature prominently in some portraits, especially in the 1960s, and Freud also produced a number of paintings purely of plants. Other regular features included mattresses in earlier works, and huge piles of the linen rags with which he used to clean his brushes in later ones. Some portraits, especially in the 1980s, have very carefully painted views of London roofscapes seen through the studio windows.\\nFreud\\'s subjects, who needed to make a very large and uncertain commitment of their time, were often the people in his life; friends, family, fellow painters, lovers, children. He said, \"The subject matter is autobiographical, it\\'s all to do with hope and memory and sensuality and involvement, really.\" However the titles were mostly anonymous, and the identity of the sitter not always disclosed; the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire had a portrait of one of Freud\\'s daughters as a baby for several years before he mentioned who the model was. In the 1970s Freud spent 4,000 hours on a series of paintings of his mother, about which art historian Lawrence Gowing observed \"it is more than 300 years since a painter showed as directly and as visually his relationship with his mother. And that was Rembrandt.\"\\nFreud painted from life, and usually spent a great deal of time with each subject, demanding the model\\'s presence even while working on the background of the portrait. Ria, Naked Portrait 2007, a nude completed in 2007, required sixteen months of work, with the model, Ria Kirby, posing all but four evenings during that time. With each session averaging five hours, the painting took approximately 2,400 hours to complete. A rapport with his models was necessary, and while at work, Freud was characterised as \"an outstanding raconteur and mimic\". Regarding the difficulty in deciding when a painting is completed, Freud said that \"he feels he\\'s finished when he gets the impression he\\'s working on somebody else\\'s painting\". Paintings were divided into day paintings done in natural light and night paintings done under artificial light, and the sessions, and lighting, were never mixed.\\nIt was Freud\\'s practice to begin a painting by first drawing in charcoal on the canvas. He then applied paint to a small area of the canvas, and gradually worked outward from that point. For a new sitter, he often started with the head as a means of \"getting to know\" the person, then painted the rest of the figure, eventually returning to the head as his comprehension of the model deepened. A section of canvas was intentionally left bare until the painting was finished. The finished painting is an accumulation of richly worked layers of pigment, as well as months of intense observation.\\n\\n\\n== Later career ==\\n\\nFreud painted fellow artists, including Frank Auerbach and Francis Bacon and produced a large number of portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery. He also painted Henrietta Moraes, a muse to many Soho artists. A series of huge nude portraits from the mid-1990s depicted Sue Tilley, or \"Big Sue\", some using her job title of \"Benefits Supervisor\" in the title of the painting, as in his 1995 portrait Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, which in May 2008 was sold by Christie\\'s in New York for $33.6 million, setting a world record auction price for a living artist.\\nFreud\\'s most consistent model in his later years was his studio assistant and friend David Dawson, the subject of his final, unfinished work. Towards the end of his life he did a nude portrait of model Kate Moss. Freud was one of the best known British artists working in a representational style, and was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1989.\\n\\nHis painting After Cézanne, noteworthy because of its unusual shape, was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia for $7.4 million. The top left section of this painting has been \\'grafted\\' on to the main section below, and closer inspection reveals a horizontal line where these two sections were joined.\\nIn 1996, the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal mounted a major exhibition of 27 paintings and thirteen etchings, covering Freud\\'s output to date. The following year the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art presented \"Lucian Freud: Early Works\". The exhibition comprised around 30 drawings and paintings done between 1940 and 1945. In 1997 Freud received the Rubens Prize of the city of Siegen. From September 2000 to March 2001, the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt was able to show 50 paintings, drawings and etchings from the late 1940s to 2000 in a larger overview exhibition despite the artist\\'s considerable resentment towards Germany. All print media bore the motif of Freud\\'s outstanding painting Sleeping by the Lion Carpet (1995-1996) depicting the nude Sue Tilley. In addition to some of his most important nude portraits of women, the large-format picture Nude with leg up (Leigh Bowery) from 1992 was also shown in Frankfurt, which was removed in the Metropolitan Museum New York from the exhibition in 1993. The Frankfurt exhibition was realised in a personal dialogue between curator Rolf Lauter and Lucian Freud and is thus the only project Freud authorised in direct cooperation with a German museum. The major retrospective at London\\'s Hayward Gallery in 1988 was the focal point for the BBC Omnibus programme which saw one of the very few conversations with Freud ever recorded, in this case with Omnibus director Jake Auerbach. The conversations with the artist were made possible by Duncan MacGuigan from Acquavella Galleries New York. This was followed by a large retrospective at Tate Britain in 2002. In 2001, Freud completed a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. There was criticism of the portrayal in some sections of the British media. In 2005, a retrospective of Freud\\'s work was held at the Museo Correr in Venice scheduled to coincide with the Biennale. In late 2007, a collection of etchings went on display at the Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\nFreud died in London on 20 July 2011 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery. Archbishop Rowan Williams officiated at the private funeral.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2008 Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (1995), a portrait of civil servant Sue Tilley, sold for $33.6 million – the highest price ever at the time for a work by a living artist. At a Christie\\'s New York auction in 2015, Benefits Supervisor Resting sold for $56.2 million.\\nOn 13 October 2011, his 1952 Boy\\'s Head, a small portrait of Charlie Lumley, his neighbour, reached $4,998,088 at Sotheby\\'s London contemporary art evening auction, making it one of the highlights of the 2011 auction autumn season.\\nOn 10 November 2015 Freud\\'s 2004 painting The Brigadier, a portrait of Andrew Parker Bowles in his British Army uniform, sold for $34.89 million US at Christie\\'s in New York City, beating the $30 million US presale estimate for the work.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn the 1940s Freud and fellow artists Adrian Ryan and John Minton were in a homosexual love triangle. After an affair with Lorna Garman, he went on to marry, in 1948, her niece Kitty Garman, the illegitimate daughter of sculptor Jacob Epstein and socialite Kathleen Garman. They had two daughters, Annabel Freud and the poet Annie Freud, before their marriage ended in 1952. Kitty Freud, later known as Kitty Godley (after her marriage in 1955 to economist Wynne Godley), died in 2011.\\nIn late 1952, Freud eloped with Guinness heiress and writer Lady Caroline Blackwood to Paris, where they married in 1953; they divorced in 1959. During the late 1970s and 80s, Freud was also famously in a relationship with fellow painter Celia Paul. \\nFreud acknowledged fourteen of his children, two from Freud\\'s first marriage and 12 by various mistresses. Writer Esther Freud and fashion designer Bella Freud are his daughters by Bernadine Coverley.\\nFreud was noted for his aversion to being photographed; he once kicked a photographer on his departure from a private dinner.\\n\\n\\n== Selected solo exhibitions ==\\n\\n1994: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\n2000: Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt\\n2003: Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\\n2004: Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh\\n2005: Museo Correr, Venice\\n2006: Acquavella Galleries, New York\\n2007: Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin\\n2008: Museum of Modern Art, New York\\n2008: Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague\\n2010: Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris\\n2012: National Portrait Gallery, London\\n2012: The Modern, Fort Worth\\n2013: Kunsthistorisches Museum, Wien\\n2016–2021: Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin\\n2019: Royal Academy of Arts\\n2022: National Gallery, London\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\nCalvocoressi, Richard (1997).

       "  'Sir Brian Clarke  (born 2 July 1953) is a British painter, architectural artist, designer and printmaker, known for his large-scale stained glass and mosaic projects, symbolist paintings, set designs, and collaborations with major figures in Modern and contemporary architecture.\\nBorn to a working-class family in Oldham, in the north of England, and a full-time art student on scholarship by age 13, Clarke came to prominence in the late 1970s as a painter and figure of the Punk movement and designer of stained glass. By the early 1980s he had become a major figure in international contemporary art, the subject of several television documentaries and a café society regular. He is known for his architectonic art, prolific output in various media, friendships with key cultural figures, and polemical lectures and interviews.\\nHis practice in architectural and autonomous stained glass, often on a monumental scale, has led to successive innovation and invention in the development of the medium. This includes the creation of stained glass without lead and the subsequent pioneering of a \\'dramatically enhanced Pointillism\\' in glass, as well as the creation of sculptural stained glass works, analogous to collage, made primarily or entirely of lead. The latter two advances are described as having taken stained glass as an art form to its zero-point in each direction: absolute transparency and complete opacity.\\nA lifelong exponent of the integration of art and architecture, his architectural collaborations include work with Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster, Arata Isozaki, Oscar Niemeyer, I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Renzo Piano. He served a seven-year term as chairman of The Architecture Foundation and served on the Design Review Committee of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. His artistic collaborations have included work with David Bailey, Hugh Hudson, Malcolm McLaren, and with Linda McCartney and Paul McCartney.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBrian Clarke was born in Oldham, Lancashire, to Edward Ord Clarke, a coal miner, and Lilian Clarke (née Whitehead), a cotton spinner. Raised in a family familiar with Spiritualism – his maternal grandmother was a notable local medium – Clarke attended a Spiritualist Lyceum throughout his childhood and was considered a \\'sensitive\\', gaining a reputation locally as a \\'boy medium\\'.\\nAged 12, he applied for a place in the last intake of an education scheme existing in the north of England to enable artistically promising children to leave their secondary school and become full-time art students,  and was awarded a scholarship to the Oldham School of Arts and Crafts. In place of a standard curriculum, he principally studied the arts and design, learning drawing, heraldry, pictorial composition, colour theory, pigment mixing and calligraphy, among other subjects. Considered a prodigy, by the age of 16 Clarke had mastered the orthodoxies of academic life drawing. In 1968, he and his family moved to Burnley and, too young at 15 to gain entrance to Burnley College of Art, he lied about his age and was accepted on the strength of his previous work.\\nIn 1970, Clarke enrolled in the Architectural Stained Glass course at North Devon College of Art and Design, graduating from the Diploma in Design with a first class distinction. In 1974, he was awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Travelling Fellowship to study religious art in Italy, France, and West Germany. He was inspired by the post-war German school of stained glass artists, and in particular the artist Johannes Schreiter. In 1976, Clarke received the Churchill Extension Fellowship to study art in architecture and contemporary painting in the United States, where he connected with the art of, and later befriended, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and Andy Warhol.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nIn his career, Clarke has advanced new approaches across a range of mediums including stained glass, mosaic, collage, painting and drawing.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\n\\nClarke received his first architectural commission at the age of 17. However, his suite of 20 windows for the Church of St Lawrence, Longridge (1975) is considered his first mature work. Here, the use of transparent glass has a Pop Art sensibility; the \\'see through’ panes embrace the everyday by letting the real world in. In 1976, Clarke received a large-scale commission from the University of Nottingham to produce 45 paintings, vestments, and a series of stained glass windows for a multi-faith chapel in the Queen\\'s Medical Centre. One of the largest public art commissions of the decade, the process of design and installation was filmed by the BBC as material for a documentary.\\nIn the early years of his career, most of Clarke\\'s work was for religious buildings. However, by 1978 his relationship with the Church had become untenable, as his designs were constantly being modified. The ending of this relationship freed Clarke to create stained glass for secular contexts and advance the medium as social art. Throughout this period, Clarke was active in bringing attention to stained glass and promoting it as a modern medium. In 1975, he organised the travelling exhibition Glass Art One, which featured secular, autonomous stained glass panels inspired in part by Japanese-landscape painting. Later, he co-curated GLASS/LIGHT, an extensive survey of twentieth-century stained glass, with British war artist John Piper and art historian Martin Harrison, in collaboration with the artist Marc Chagall as part of the 1978 Festival of the City of London. Clarke also produced the book Architectural Stained Glass,a polemical collection of essays.\\nIn his painting, Clarke developed a strictly abstract Constructivist language of geometric signs; often his work had an underlying grid structure made from repetitions and variations on the cross. In later years, he would disrupt the grid with free-flowing amorphic forms. In 1977 Punk hit the UK, which had a deep impact on Clarke. He connected with Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren and later collaborated as a designer on their aborted zine Chicken, whose creation was funded by EMI and filmed by BBC\\'s Arena. He also expressed Punk\\'s nihilistic energy in the 1977 series of paintings, ‘Dangerous Visions’ (1977). Around the same time, Clarke became friends with the physical chemist Lord Snow. After Snow\\'s death, he made a tributary portfolio of screenprints; their title, The Two Cultures referenced Snow\\'s influential 1959 Rede Lecture on the perceived gulf between the humanities and sciences. In 1983 the Tate acquired an edition of The Two Cultures.\\nBetween 1978 and 1979, the BBC filmed Clarke\\'s studio practice and life for an hour-long BBC Omnibus documentary, Brian Clarke: The Story So Far. Millions watched the documentary in the UK, and the BBC recorded multiple viewer complaints. The programme and subsequent press coverage, including Clarke\\'s appearance on the cover of Vogue, photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, brought him to broader public attention. Later in 1979, Clarke became a presenter on the BBC2 arts programme Mainstream and the BBC Radio 4 programme Kaleidescope, conducting interviews with figures including Brassaï, Andy Warhol, John Lennon, and Elisabeth Lutyens. He also gave Sheffield band The Human League their first television appearance.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\n\\nIn the 1980s Clarke was instrumental in bringing stained glass into the public sphere. He received his first international commission for paintings, a wooden construction, and a suite of stained glass windows for the Olympus European Headquarters Building in Hamburg, completed in 1981. Marking a major shift in his own practice and breaking with tradition, he had the windows made at a studio in Germany. The experience of their immersive colour prompted critics to describe them as the Colour Field of stained glass. Another development in this work is Clarke\\'s liberation of the lead line from being a purely structural element: where the lead breaks free, it takes on an expressive quality. In the same year, receiving a commission from the Government of Saudi Arabia for the Royal Mosque of King Khalid International Airport, Clarke studied Islamic ornament at the Quran schools in Fez. Following this, in 1984, the architectural practice Derek Latham and Co. asked Clarke to collaborate on the refurbishment of Henry Currey\\'s Grade II listed Thermal Baths in Buxton. Satisfying his social ambitions for the medium, he enclosed the former Victorian spa in a barrel-vaulted skin of stained glass, bathing the public space “in an immense blue light”. It is one of Clarke\\'s earliest works to have been designed to have a deliberate nocturnal presence.\\n\\nIn 1988, architect Arata Isozaki approached Clarke to collaborate on the Lake Sagami Building in Yamanishi. Clarke designed a composition of stained glass for the central lantern and a series of interrelated skylights that referenced elements of Isozaki\\'s building. In the same period, Clarke collaborated with Norman Foster and his architectural practice Foster + Partners to design stained glass for Stansted Airport\\'s new terminal building. For the first time in the history of stained glass, computer-assisted design was utilised in its visualisation and design. Partly for security reasons, the design couldn\\'t be used. The final commission was for two friezes and a 6-metre high tower of stained glass. While their abstract, constructivist forms resonated with Foster\\'s language, Clarke has recently expressed how the medieval technology of lead and stained glass was at odds with the material qualities of High-tech architecture. An urge to resolve this conflict later spurred Clarke to embrace the most cutting-edge glass technology.\\nEqually experimental across other mediums, Clarke\\'s painting practice was also inspired by technology. Noticing the similarity between the reticular, Constructivist-derived symbols that dominated his work and the light-metering computergrams from Olympus OM System cameras, he produced a series of technology-related paintings, including Time Lag Zero, for the headquarters of Olympus Optical (UK). During this period, Clarke produced the cover painting for Paul McCartney\\'s solo album Tug of War, designing the cover with Linda McCartney. He also created the stage designs for Paul McCartney\\'s World Tour (1989–90).\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nContinuing to work collaboratively with leading architects, Clarke started to challenge the traditional containment of stained glass within a frame and fashion entire facades from glass. When Future Systems (the architectural practice of Jan Kaplický and Amanda Levete) asked Clarke to collaborate on The Glass Dune (1992), he proposed an internal ‘skin of art’ for their innovative boomerang-shaped building, which was never realised. Collaborating later with expressionist architect Will Alsop on the design of Hôtel du Département des Bouches du Rhône (which became known as Le Grand Bleu), Clarke clad the building in an Yves Klein blue glass. A landmark in the city of Marseille, the building is now considered a major work of late 20th century architecture.\\nDesiring lighter and more expansive fields of glass, Clarke continued searching for new technologies. Working with architect Zaha Hadid on a proposal for the Spittelau Viaducts Housing Project, Vienna, he developed a new type of mouth-blown glass, which he christened \\'Zaha-Glas\\'. Although this project was never realised, the newly developed \\'Zaha-Glas\\' was first used architecturally in Clarke\\'s scheme for the ceiling of Pfizer World Headquarters in New York, a landmark architectural art project that connected 42nd and 43rd Streets in Manhattan. Working with Foster on the design for the Al Faisaliyah Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (installed 1999), Clarke abandoned the medieval technology of glass and supportive lead entirely and conceived a novel solution that involved firing a ceramic frit glaze into float glass. The new glass had a lightness that matched Norman Foster\\'s High-tech building. Clarke, however, continued to use traditional, medieval technologies in other architectural contexts.  \\nClarke continued to be active in other mediums in addition to stained glass. In 1993, he created the set designs for Paul McCartney\\'s New World Tour (1993); one of the sets was a collage of stained glass through the ages. The following year, Clarke had a joint show with Linda McCartney. The exhibition, Collaborations, showed works by both artists and collaborative pieces in which McCartney\\'s photos were silkscreened onto mouth-blown glass using a process of their own devising.\\nIn 1998 the English High Court severed all ties between Francis Bacon\\'s former gallery, Marlborough Fine Art, and the Estate of Francis Bacon. Clarke was appointed sole executor of the Estate of Francis Bacon, acting on behalf of Bacon\\'s heir John Edwards. Clarke transferred representation of Francis Bacon to the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York, where an exhibition was mounted of seventeen previously unseen Bacon paintings recovered from his studio. Clarke brought a second court case against Marlborough Fine Art, alleging that the gallery had underpaid Bacon for his work, asserted undue influence over him, and failed to account for up to 33 of his paintings. Following Edwards\\' diagnosis with lung cancer in 2002, the litigation was settled out of court, with each side paying its own costs. During the legal process an undisclosed number of Bacon\\'s paintings were recovered from Marlborough, and \"vast quantities of correspondence and documents relating to the life of the artist were handed over by the gallery\".\\n\\nIn 1998, Edwards and Clarke donated the contents of Bacon\\'s studio at 7 Reece Mews, London, left untouched since Bacon\\'s death, to the Hugh Lane, the Dublin City Gallery. What followed was a unique conservation project. A decision was taken to preserve the studio as it stood, and a team of archaeologists, art historians, conservators, and curators were involved in the move from London to Dublin. The locations of over 7,000 items were documented, and in Dublin, the studio was rebuilt using all the original doors, flooring, walls, and ceiling, and the items were placed exactly as they were left. The studio opened to the public in 2001, accompanied by the first-ever database to list the contents of an artist\\'s studio.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nContinuing to advance his architectural vision for stained glass, in 2015 Clarke orchestrated the site-specific exhibition Lamina at the Gagosian Gallery, London, where floor to ceiling stained glass depicting golden leaves transformed the gallery space and immersed the visitors illuminated natural forms. Nature became a central theme for Clarke\\'s work in these years. In an interview, Clarke acknowledged feeling close to Henri Matisse, who had worked in stained glass and whose work often glorified the wonders of nature. Nature also inspired Clarke\\'s stained glass and ceramic works at Mall Cottages in West London. Clarke worked with Norman Foster on the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a landmark building in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, built to house the triennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions. Clarke\\'s 9,700 square expanse of stained glass crowns the apex of the pyramid (installed 2006), featuring imagery of soaring doves. \\nIn another example of Clarke breaking the medieval relationship between glass and lead, in the 2000s he took the radical step to inverse their relationship and began fashioning works entirely of lead. In these autonomous lead works, Clarke often uses the somber weightiness of lead to explore darker themes like mortality. His leadwork Don\\'t Forget the Lamb (2014) is a memorial to his late mother.\\nIn this period, nature inspired Clarke\\'s work in other mediums as well. His drawings of flowers use negative space as an expressive element, isolating the flowers in empty space with his signature, nervy line. This is seen in his later series, \\'Night Orchids\\', exhibited at PACE Gallery in 2016. Clarke\\'s collages are equally experimental; the carefully chosen, often torn, fragments and chalk drawings build an image that attempts to capture the essence of the flower depicted. In a radical gesture, Clarke brought the language of collage to stained glass in a wrap-around window at Peel Cottage (installed 2009), where he incorporated fragments of medieval glass within a contemporary design.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s to present ===\\nIn 2010, Clarke was commissioned to design stained windows for the new Papal Chapel of the Apostolic Nunciature, the diplomatic embassy of the Holy See to Great Britain, for the 2010 visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom, the first-ever state visit made by a pope to Britain. The exhibition The Art of Light (2018) in Norwich highlighted Clarke\\'s free-standing glass panels. While their folding structures draw inspiration from Japanese folding screens, they explore a new context for stained glass, no longer confined to the fabric of a building, but nevertheless having a strong architectural impact on whatever space they inhabit. The subject matter of these panels is diverse: many depict flowers and nature\\'s opulence in vivid colour, but there are also images of intense grief and Pop-inspired subject matter. A Pop sensibility also runs through his Caryatids panels (2002), which depict muscular young men in beachwear by the sea. The work received criticism when it was shown at Christie\\'s, London in 2011, reflective of the traditionalist values that surround the medium of stained glass.\\nIn 2015, Clarke curated A Strong Sweet Smell of Incense: A Portrait of Robert Fraser, an exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, in association with Pace Gallery, together with author Harriet Vyner (whose \\'cult biography\\' of Fraser, Groovy Bob, Clarke had contributed to). The 2014 solo exhibition Spitfires and Primroses with the Pace Gallery, juxtaposed two recent series of works, pairing oil paintings of the Second World War aircraft, arranged in a heraldic semé, with watercolours of English primroses.

       "  'Bruno Fonseca (1958 – May 31, 1994) was an American artist who shifted between abstract and figurative styles and worked in both painting and sculpture.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nFonseca was born in New York to a family of artists. His father, Gonzalo Fonseca, was an Uruguayan sculptor. His younger brother Caio Fonseca is a well known contemporary painter. His sister Isabel Fonseca is a writer. Fonseca had dyslexia and a stutter, conditions so severe as a child he was treated by a psychiatrist. Fonseca was able to compensate for his verbal difficulties with a tremendous visual fluency, reproducing paintings by Michelangelo and other Great Masters at an early age. Raised in a house on West Eleventh Street in Greenwich Village, Fonseca studied at the Dalton School in Manhattan and St. Ann\\'s School in Brooklyn Heights. Fonseca failed to graduate from high school and at age 18, he moved to Barcelona, where he studied with Augusto Torres. Fonseca lived in Barcelona until 1993, when he returned to New York a few months before his death.\\nFonseca had what his sister called \"a slightly perverse anti-taste for exquisite goods and \\'luxuries\\' of all kinds.\" He preferred old objects, old clothes and junk that he collected from the streets of Barcelona. He chose to live in Barcelona\\'s red-light district, among the city\\'s poor, cripples, addicts, street girls, and bohemians.\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\nLate in his life, Fonseca painted four large paintings known as \"The War Murals\" depicting scenes of warfare. The individual works are titled Tank (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 269.2 cm) Fire (oil on canvas, 207 x 284.5 cm), Bucharest (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 279.4 cm), and Timișoara (oil on canvas, 210.8 x 271.7 cm). One writer described the anti-war theme in \"The War Murals\", begun in 1989 and finished in 1993, as \"the most powerful statement of their kind since Picasso\\'s great Guernica.\" The murals were inspired by images of boy soldiers torn from the newspaper and by images of violence in Eastern Europe, including the public execution of Nicolae Ceauşescu. His sister recalled watching scenes of the upheavals in Eastern Europe on CNN with Bruno and wrote: \"The War Murals - Bruno\\'s four larger narrative paintings inspired by the anti-communist upheavals - represent his greatest synthesis of abstract and representational painting, something he had struggled for throughout his working life.\" Fonseca worked on the murals for several years, finishing them while he was suffering from the effects of AIDS. A public showing of \"The War Murals\" was the opening exhibition for the John McEnroe Gallery in SoHo in January 1994. Fonseca also had a solo show at New York\\'s Salander-O\\'Reilly in 1993.\\nAfter contracting AIDS, Fonseca returned to New York. He married his pupil, German painter Anke Blaue, shortly before his death. He died of AIDS in 1994 at age 36.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==',\n",
       "  'Walter Joseph De Maria (October 1, 1935 – July 25, 2013) was an American artist, sculptor, illustrator and composer, who lived and worked in New York City. Walter de Maria\\'s artistic practice is connected with minimal art, conceptual art, and land art of the 1960s.\\nLACMA director Michael Govan said, \"I think he\\'s one of the greatest artists of our time.\" Govan, who worked with De Maria for a number of years, found De Maria\\'s work \"singular, sublime and direct\".\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nDe Maria was born in 1935 in Albany, California. His parents were the proprietors of a local restaurant in Albany and were socially very active, while their son was mostly concentrated on music. Walter De Maria\\'s first academic interest was music—first piano, then percussion. He also took to sports and cars, of which he made drawings. By 1946 he had joined a musicians\\' union.\\nDe Maria studied history and art at the University of California, Berkeley from 1953 to 1959. Trained as a painter, he soon turned to sculpture and began using other media. In 1960, De Maria and his friends, the avant-garde composers La Monte Young and Terry Riley, participated in happenings and theatrical productions in the San Francisco area. From his exposure to the work of La Monte Young and dancer Simone Forti, among others, De Maria developed an interest in task-oriented, game-like projects that resulted in viewer-interactive sculptures. For example, his Boxes for Meaningless Work (1961) is inscribed with the instructions, \"Transfer things from one box to the next box back and forth, back and forth, etc. Be aware that what you are doing is meaningless.\"\\nIn 1960, De Maria  moved to New York City where he married his wife Susanne Wilson (later Susanna) one year later.\\nHis early sculptures from the 1960s were influenced by Dada, suprematism and constructivism. This influence led De Maria into using simple geometric shapes and industrially manufactured materials such as stainless steel and aluminium – materials which are also characteristic of Minimal art. With the support of collector Robert C. Scull, De Maria started making pieces in metal in 1965.\\nAlso in the mid-1960s, he became involved in various artistic activities. His piece, Cage, for John Cage, was included in the seminal 1966 Primary Structures exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He appeared in happenings, composed two musical works (Cricket Music, 1964; Ocean Music, 1968), and produced two films (Three Circles and Two Lines in the Desert; Hardcore, both 1969).\\nDe Maria briefly ran a gallery on Great Jones Street in lower Manhattan with his wife Susanna, showing Joseph Cornell\\'s collection of rare films, Robert Whitman\\'s Happenings (he was then married to and created with dancer/artist Simone Forti), and exhibiting De Maria\\'s Minimalist sculptures made of wood.\\nIn 1965 De Maria became the drummer in the New York-based rock group the Primitives and an artist/musician collaborative group called The Druds. The Primitives included Lou Reed and John Cale and was a precursor to The Velvet Underground. \\nIn 1980, De Maria bought a four-story, 16,400-square-foot Con Edison substation at 421 East Sixth Street, and an adjacent lot at No. 419, between First Avenue and Avenue A. In February 2014, this property was selling for $25 million. Businessman and art collector Peter Brant purchased De Maria\\'s studio for $27 million. Brant\\'s plans for the space were unknown.\\nThe building was developed into the \"Brant Art Center,\" part of the Peter Brant collection. https://www.brantfoundation.org/visit/\\nDe Maria went to California in May 2013 to celebrate his mother\\'s 100th birthday and had a stroke there a few days later. He remained there for treatment. He died in Los Angeles on July 25, 2013, at the age of 77. He was survived by his mother, Christine De Maria; his brother, Terry; four nieces; four nephews; and four grandnieces and two great-grandnieces.\\n\\n\\n== Installations ==\\nFrom 1968 De Maria produced Minimalist sculptures and installations such as the Munich Erdraum of 1968. He realized Land art projects in the deserts of the south-west US, with the aim of creating situations where the landscape and nature, light and weather would become an intense, physical and psychic experience. In his work, De Maria stressed that the work of art is intended to make the viewer think about the earth and its relationship to the universe.\\nThe Lightning Field (1977) is De Maria\\'s best-known work. It consists of 400 stainless steel posts arranged in a calculated grid over an area of 1 mile × 1 km. The time of day and weather change the optical effects. It also lights up during thunder storms. The field is commissioned and maintained by Dia Art Foundation. It has been speculated that The Lightning Field influenced the imagery of author Cormac McCarthy\\'s epilogue in his 1985 novel, Blood Meridian.\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, De Maria created enduring urban works. As complementary pieces, Vertical Earth Kilometer (1977), and The Broken Kilometer (1979), address the idea of unseen or abstracted distance. Vertical Earth Kilometer is a one-kilometer-long brass rod, two inches in diameter, drilled into Friedrichsplatz Park in central Kassel, Germany. The rod\\'s circular top, flush to the earth\\'s surface, is framed by a two-meter square plate of red sandstone. In 1979, De Maria meticulously arranged five hundred brass rods for The Broken Kilometer, a permanent installation at 393 West Broadway in New York.\\nIn contrast to the hard metal of both Kilometer pieces, the third of these urban works, The New York Earth Room (1977), is a 3,600-square-foot room filled to a depth of 22 inches with 250 cubic yards of earth (the New York work is a permanent iteration of Munich Earth Room, 1968, a temporary installation in Munich). Also in 1977, the artist recreated the work at the Heiner Friedrich Gallery in New York, which was then permanently reinstalled in 1980 at 141 Wooster Street, New York.\\nThe Broken Kilometer is also part of De Maria\\'s series of monumental sculptures using a horizontal format, which feature groupings of elements ordered according to precise calculations. This series includes 360°/I-Ching (1981), A Computer Which Will Solve Every Problem in the World/3-12 Polygon (1984), 13, 14, 15 Meter Rows (1985), Apollo\\'s Ecstasy (1990), and The 2000 Sculpture (1992).\\nIn 1989 De Maria completed a sphere of polished granite for the Assemblée Nationale in Paris, followed in 2000 and 2004 by works for two museums on Naoshima Island in Japan, the Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum and the Chichu Art Museum. A comparable, 25-ton sculpture entitled Large Red Sphere (2002) was installed in the Türkentor, Munich, in 2010.\\nOne Sun/34 Moons (2002), conceived by the artist in collaboration with architect Steven Holl, was opened 2007 at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City. In 2010, The 2000 Sculpture (1992) was the first work of art to inaugurate the Resnick Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nDe Maria and Robert Whitman opened the 9 Great Jones Street gallery in New York in 1963; the same year, De Maria\\'s first solo show of sculpture was presented there. He had his first solo exhibition in a commercial gallery in 1965, at the Paula Johnson Gallery on New York\\'s Upper East Side. (Its owner soon became better known with the Paula Cooper Gallery)\\nDe Maria avoided participating in museum shows when he could, preferring to create his installations outdoors or at unconventional urban locations. His work was more widely shown outside the United States, and he had major exhibitions in Japan and Europe.\\nIn 1968 and 1977, De Maria participated in Documenta in Kassel; he installed his permanent public sculpture Vertical Earth Kilometer in the city\\'s Friedrichsplatz Park. In 1977, a major exhibition of De Maria\\'s sculpture was held at the Kunstmuseum Basel in 1972. He has also since been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions organized by Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1981), Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1984), Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart (1987), Moderna Museet in Stockholm (1988), Gemäldegalerie in Berlin (1998), and Chichu Art Museum in Naoshima (2000 and 2004). Organized by the Menil Collection in 2011, \"Walter De Maria: Trilogies\" was the artist\\'s first major museum exhibition in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Films ==\\nIn 2015, filmmaker and art historian James Crump produced and directed Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art. Set in the desolate desert spaces of the American southwest, this feature documentary film contains rare footage of De Maria and the artist\\'s extant and non-extant works. Troublemakers was one of twelve documentary films selected by the 53rd New York Film Festival, September 25–October 11, 2015.

       "  'Sofia Areal  (born in Lisbon, 4 June 1960) is a Portuguese abstract painter, whose works adhere mostly to organic non-geometrical forms and a strong chromatic focus. Besides painting and drawing, Areal\\'s work involves collage, textile design, and scenography.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nAreal was born in Lisbon in 1960, daughter of the painter António Areal (1934-1978) and Maria Lira dos Passos Freitas Pereira (born 1937). She is the second of four sisters. Her father, besides being a painter, wrote several essays plus books on criticism and poetry. The mother, also an artist, has a course in sculpture and currently dedicates herself to drawing. The paternal grandfather, Joaquim Santiago Areal e Silva, was an architect and, together with Jorge Segurado, was one of those responsible for the restoration of national monuments in the 1950s. On the maternal side of the family, from the island of Madeira, the great-grandfather and the grandmother, linked to the arts, had studied in England. Areal grew up between Lisbon, Funchal, Azores and Mozambique.\\nAreal began her artistic training in the UK, where she attended the Textile Design course (1978-1979) and the Foundation Course (1979-1980) at the Hertfordshire College of Art & Design in St Albans. Upon returning to Portugal, she attended, between 1981 and 1983, the painting and drawing workshops at AR.CO, in Lisbon. She was a student of Rogério Ribeiro, António Sena and José Mouga. Besides painting and drawing, Areal developed her art in the fields of illustration, graphic design and set design. In 1982, she married the sculptor Rui Sanches, with whom she lived for 20 years and with whom she had a son, the artist Martim Brion.\\nAlthough she presented her work in group exhibitions throughout the 1980s, it was mainly from the invitation made by Alda Cortez to show at her gallery in 1990 that Areal started a regular dynamic in the public presentation of her works, which she has maintained until the present day.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nSofia Areal started her training in England, taking the course in textile design and the foundation course at the Hertfordshire College of Art and Design, St Albans (1979–81), before continuing her studies in Portugal at Ar.Co engraving and painting workshops in Lisbon. She has participated in collective exhibitions since 1982 and held individual exhibitions since 1990. In addition to paintings and drawings, she also works in illustration and scenography.\\nAreal’s research into forms and light brings painting and drawing into very close proximity where the dividing line mainly appears in the supporting material. Different techniques do not create rupture. Except for oil, acrylic (which she also uses on her canvases) is also involved in her work, in close association with coloured pencils, India ink, watercolours, graphite and collage. While colour is stronger in her painting, it is always present in her drawings, jus as the textured lines of wax crayon or coloured pencil also appear on her canvases. In both forms, she searches for a spatial balance that is seen as a harmony between occupied and empty spaces, opacity and transparency within a graphic game of contrasts, what Sonia Delaunay called simultaneous. Indeed her work and Areal’s share some significant similarities. Created using a vibrant palette dominated by shades of black, white, red and yellow, combined with blues and greens, they create tension with the fragile lines that are superimposed on areas of colour, turning the act of painting and drawing into means of writing and rewriting the world. Her work challenges it, records it and reworks it in bipolar form, bringing us face to face with primordial forces, safe within the maelstrom of her intuitive and immediate creative act, which makes it similar to the Surrealist way of creating. Yet this quality does not eliminate the hesitations surrounding her artistic thinking. The format of the canvases also underlines her research her research into the ways of balancing night and day, Dionysus and Apollo, ranging from rectangles to circular tondos. The latter, cunningly fulfilling their function as targets, establish themselves as metaphors for the attention required by observing and creating. Indeed, apart from the material supports (which in the case of her drawings, are long sheets that already mimic the lined notebooks where people write), the backgrounds also act as a statement of energy, suggesting an Oriental-style precision of complements and completeness. Moreover, the lines or the texture, which appear over these backgrounds in nervy veins whose dynamism is apparent in the funneling or increasing density that manages to metamorphose into areas, underline the presence of those forces and their necessary and wise fruition and effort.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions (selection) ==\\nSofia Areal has exhibited her work in collective exhibitions since 1982 and individually since 1990.\\nSolo Exhibitions (selection):\\n2016 – “Restlessly: Variations on the same theme”, João Esteves de Oliveira Gallery, Lisbon, Portugal\\n2015 - “How utterly shameless – Bite with all the teeth you have in your tongue”, Politecnica Theatre, Artistas Unidos, Lisbon, Portugal\\n2014 - “113o 55’E 21o 11’N”, Casa Garden, Macao S.A.R., China.\\n2011 - “YES”, anthological exhibition of the last ten years, Cordoaria Nacional, Galeria do Torreão Nascente, Lisbon, Portugal.\\n2009 “An Anti-pain practice”, Pró-Évora Group, Évora, Portugal.\\n2006 “360 degrees in the SUN”, Museu de Arte Contêmporanea do Funchal, now MUDAS Madeira Museum of Contemporary Art, Madeira, Portugal.\\n2002 “Sofia Areal about João Miguel Fernandes Jorge\\'s notebooks”, Casa da Cerca - Contemporary Art Centre, Almada, Portugal.\\n2000 “Some of mine mine”, Casa da Cerca - Contemporary Art Centre, Almada, Portugal.\\n1993 “Painting and drawing by Sofia Areal”, J.M.

He studied art at Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology, Cheltenham, from 1968 to 1970, and painted at the Wimbledon School of Art, London, from 1970 to 1973. The same year he went on to study sculpture at the Royal College of Art, London, completing an MA in 1977.\\nHe moved to Wuppertal in 1977 because his first wife was from there. There were also cheap studio spaces and exhibition organisers looking for new artists. He was fascinated by the importance of sculpture in Germany, and struck by German seriousness.\\nIn 1979 Daniel the first of his 4 children was born. He is currently married to the artist Tatjana Verhasselt.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nTony Cragg\\'s early work involved site-specific installations of found objects and discarded materials.\\nFrom the mid-1970s through to the early 1980s he presented assemblages in primary structures (as in his first mature piece, the 1975 Stack) as well as in colourful, representational reliefs on the floors and walls of gallery spaces (as in Red Indian of 1982–83). Cragg constructed these early works by arranging individual fragments of mixed materials, often according to their artificial colours and profiles, so as to form larger images.\\nIn 1977 Cragg moved to Wuppertal, Germany and had several solo exhibitions including Lisson Gallery, London (1979); Lützowstraße Situation, Berlin (1979) and Künstlerhaus Weidenallee, Hamburg (1979). He also exhibited in seminal group shows including the Silver Jubilee Sculpture Show, Battersea Park, London (1977); Europa-Kunst der 80er Jahre, Stuttgart (1979); Kunst in Europa na \\'68, Museum van Hedendaagse Kunst, Gent (1980) and L\\'art degli anni Settanta/Aperto \\'80, Venice Biennale (1980).\\n\\nIn 1981 he created \"Britain Seen from the North\" considered a signature early work, made of multi-coloured scraps of various materials assembled in relief on the wall. The piece depicts the outline of the island of Great Britain, orientated sideways so that Northern Britain is positioned to the left. The island is scrutinized by a figure, representing Cragg himself, who looks at his native country from the position of an outsider. The piece is often interpreted as commenting on the social and economic difficulties that Britain was facing under Thatcherism, which had particular effect in the north. This work was first exhibited in the large upstairs space at the Whitechapel Art gallery in London in 1981 and is now in the Tate collection.\\nIn the early 1980s Cragg gradually moved away from installation art and began to examine more closely the individual objects used as parts of his larger constellations. This was the beginning of his engagement and experimentation with the properties and possibilities of a wide range of more permanent materials in the form of wood, plaster, stone, fiberglass, Kevlar, stainless steel, cast iron and bronze. During this time Cragg exhibited at Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol (1980); Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1980); Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal (1981); Institute of Contemporary Art, London (1982); Documenta 7, Kassel (1982) and the Hayward and Serpentine Galleries, London (1983). Since then Cragg has exhibited extensively at many of world\\'s most important art institutions.\\n\\nIn 1988 Cragg received the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery in London, represented Britain at the 42nd Venice Biennale (1988) and was appointed Professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (1988–2001).\\nThroughout the 1990s Cragg continued to develop two larger groups of work that have sustained his production up to the present: the \"Early Forms\" and the \"Rational Beings\". The Early Forms series investigate the possibilities of manipulating everyday, familiar containers and the ways in which they can morph into and around one another in space. The sculptures derive their profiles and contours from simple, tick-walled vessels such as chemistry vessels, plastic bottles and mortars. The surface of these initial objects are extended and contorted until new, sculpturally independent forms of movement arise. Through these processes of manipulation the initial objects develop new lines and contours, positive and negatively curving surfaces and volumes, protrusions and deep recessing folds. The broad field of containers and vessels used function as metaphors for cell, organ, organism or body. The Early Forms can be characterized as forms transmutating along a bilaterally curved axis, often with organic, even figurative, qualities. The Rational Beings are describable as organic looking forms often made of carbon fibre on a core of polystyrene. These sculptures derive their forms from the contours of gestural drawings, which Cragg then translates into the third dimension using thick, circular or oval discs which are superimposed (often vertically), glued together and covered with a skin.\\nDuring the 1990s he exhibited at the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); the \"Terrae Motus\" collection at the Royal Palace of Caserta, Italy (1994); The National Gallery, Prague (1995); MNAM, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1996); MACBA, Barcelona (1997) and the Royal Academy, London (1999). In the early 2000s Cragg was awarded the Shakespeare Prize (2001) and the Piepenbrock Prize for Sculptures (2002). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) (2002), Honorary Doctor of the Royal College of Art, London (2009), Professor at the Universitüt der Künste, Berlin (2001–2006), and began a Professorship at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (2006). Among many major solo shows, Cragg exhibited at Tate Gallery Liverpool (2000); MACRO Museum of Contemporary Art, Rome (2003); and The Central House of Artists, Moscow (2005).\\nIn 2011 Cragg exhibited at the Musée du Louvre in Paris, the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh and in 2012 at CAFA Museum in Beijing. His sculpture Accurate Figure is currently on display in the garden at the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas. Amongst new developments in Cragg\\'s work is an increase in sculptures that can be exhibited outdoors; more works wrought from bronze, steel, stone, wood and glass; as well as a vigorous return to his initial interest in art – that of drawing.\\nFollowing Brexit he became a German Citizen. He stated that he had found his life in Germany and \"wouldn\\'t like to experience any disadvantages in the future either\".\\n\\n\\n== Waldfrieden Sculpture Park & the Cragg Foundation ==\\n\\nThe Cragg Foundation is a non-profit general foundation based in Wuppertal. It was founded in 2005 by the Cragg family and incorporated on 13 December 2005. It includes  Tatjana Cragg as chairperson, Tony Cragg as deputy chairperson and Michael Brämer. Its foundation purpose is \"Art and culture – in general\".\\nThe foundation runs the 25 acre Waldfrieden Sculpture Park in the Barmer district of Hesselnberg, Wuppertal. There is a house and 2 other exhibition buildings in a wooded park. The park opened in 2008. There are about 40 outdoor sculptures by various artists including Tony Cragg, Henry Moore, Jaume Plensa, Thomas Schütte, Richard Deacon, Eva Hild, Bogomir Ecker, Hubert Kiecol, Hede Bühl and Markus Lüpertz. There are temporary exhibitions, and a music and lecture programme.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition, awards ==\\n\\nCragg was selected to represent Britain at the 43rd Venice Biennale in 1988, and won the Turner Prize in the same year. \\nIn the early 1990s, Cragg was awarded the Chevalier des Arts Lettres (1992) and appointed Royal Academician in London (1994). \\nIn 2001 he received the now discontinued Shakespeare Prize of the Alfred Toepfer Foundation of Hamburg. He was made a CBE for services to art in the 2002 New Year Honours List, and also won the Piepenbrock Prize for Sculpture in that year. In 2007, he received the Praemium Imperiale for sculpture of the Imperial House of Japan for the Japan Art Association.\\nSince 2010, Cragg has been appointed Honorary Fellow of University of the Arts London (2012); awarded Artist\\'s Medal of Honor of the Hermitage, Russia (2012) as well as the Grand Cross 1st Class Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2012). In 2018 he was awarded the Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia; the Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.\\nIn 2014 he was awarded honorary citizenship of Wuppertal.\\nIn the 2016 Birthday Honours Cragg was created a Knight Bachelor for services to visual arts and UK-German relations.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nNew Forms (sculpture), Houston, Texas\\nRunner (sculpture)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website\\nSkulpturenpark Waldfrieden',\n",

His main tools are recording devices (camera, tape deck, radar, sonar) used in an ongoing investigation of electricity, frequency, architectural space, and paranormal electronic interference. Major exhibitions include Manifesta (1996), documenta X (1997), the Johannesburg Biennial (1997), Sound Art - Sound as Media at ICC in Tokyo (2000), the Venice Biennale (2001, 2003, and 2005), and Portikus, Frankfurt (2004). Von Hausswolff received a Prix Ars Electronica award for Digital Music in 2002.\\nVon Hausswolff was born in Linköping. He is an expert in the work of Friedrich Jürgenson, an electronic voice phenomenon (EVP) researcher who claimed to have detected voices of the dead hidden in radio static. Von Hausswolff\\'s own sound works are pure, intuitive studies of electricity, frequency, and tone. Collaborators include Erik Pauser, with whom he worked as Phauss (1981-1993), Leif Elggren, and John Duncan (artist). He also collaborates with EVP researcher Michael Esposito, filmmaker Thomas Nordanstad, and with Graham Lewis (Wire) and Jean-Louis Huhta in the band OSCID.\\nVon Hausswolff is noted for creating sound works that \"charge the air with subliminal force\" using \"drones, radio signals, and sonic frequencies\".\\nVon Hausswolff is co-monarch (with Elggren) of the conceptual art project The Kingdoms of Elgaland-Vargaland (KREV): all areas of no-man\\'s land, territories between national boundaries on both land and sea, and digital and mental spaces. This nation has its own national anthem, flag, coat of arms, currency, citizens, and ministers.\\nRecent audio works include \"800 000 Seconds in Harar\" (Touch), \"Matter Transfer\" (iDeal), \"The Wonderful World of Male Intuition\" (Oral), \"There Are No Crows Flying Around the Hancock Building\" (Lampo), \"Rats\", \"Maggots\", and \"Bugs\" (all three on Laton), \"Three Overpopulated Cities ...\" (Sub Rosa), \"A Lecture on Disturbances in Architecture\" (Firework Editions), and \"Ström\" and \"Leech\" (both on Raster-Noton).\\nOther visual works include \"Red Pool\" (Cities on the Move, Bangkok, 1999), \"Red Night\" (SITE Santa Fe, 1999), \"Red Code\" (CCA Kitakyushu, 2001), \"Red Empty\" (Lampo/WhiteWalls, Chicago, 2003), and \"Red Mersey\" (Liverpool Biennial, 2004).\\nHe is also the curator and producer of the sound-installation \"freq out\", shown at Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Henie-Onstad Center (Oslo), Sonambiente (Berlin), and other places.\\nAround the year 1986, he formed the Swedish independent label Radium 226.05 and in 1990 he formed the label Anckarström.\\nIn 2012, Von Hausswolff was heavily criticized for allegedly using ashes of Holocaust victims from the Majdanek concentration camp in a painting. As of 12 December 2012, the Martin Bryder Gallery in Lund had pulled the painting from exhibition.\\nIn 2019, von Hausswolff formed a new musical collaboration with the Icelandic musician Jónsi (Sigur Rós), which they named Dark Morph. On 10 May 2019, they released their first album, also titled Dark Morph. The project \"promises to explore the ramifications of ongoing environmental collapse to the oceans and its inhabitants.\" The album consists mainly of ambient sounds, often simulating the sounds of animals and nature, and contains very few actual melodies.\\nCarl Michael is the father of musician/composer Anna von Hausswolff.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nINTERRUPTIONS #14.

       "  'Artur Barrio (Artur Alipio Barrio de Sousa Lopes) is an artist who lives and works in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Much of his work consists of installation pieces that create interaction with the public. Barrio engages the viewer as participant in his art, often without their knowledge that it is art in which they are participating.  By doing so, the participant can have an experience not removed from life but rather incorporated into it. He wants to encourage contact with all of reality including the discards of life such as garbage. He wants us to recognize that this reality is just as real if we can see past the symbolic meanings we attach to these objects. (Manifesto MUD/MEAT SEWER)\\n\\n\\n== Early life and training ==\\nBarrio was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1945. \\nIn 1952, he spent six months in Angola “where he discovered the African culture.” He then moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1955. In 1967, he attended the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (School of Fine Arts), one of the centers of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. His teachers included Onofre Penteado, Abelardo Zaluar, Mário Barata and Ítalo Campofiorito.\\nBarrio returned to Portugal during the Portuguese revolution in 1974. In 1975 he moved to Paris, and then in 1981 to Amsterdam. He had an solo exhibition in artist initiative Schottenburch, Amsterdam in 1981. Currently, he lives successively in Amsterdam, Aix-en-Provence and Rio de Janeiro.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nArtur Barrio is an extreme example of the development of art that took place during his early career. It was a time when barriers within art were being tested and pushed to the breaking point. Barrio expressed his understanding of these artistic forces in his work. We can see the imprint of his time on his work in the content, the materials, and the processes he employs in his work. He makes strong anti-art establishment statements showing a kinship with the Dada artists. He also displays his understanding the Fluxus ideas about flow, process and material usage. These influences combined during the late sixties when the counterculture was at its height. His process, his vision and his materials all meld in a form of Situationist art where his pieces become more than installations but also a part of the reality in which they exist.\\n\\n\\n== Description of style ==\\nArtur Barrio is seeking to create an experience. He uses both ephemeral and precarious materials that provoke an extreme sensorial reaction. Items such as coffee grinds overwhelm the nose while blood or meat produce a gut reaction. There is a concrete connection to the body and to food. This all generates a reanalysis of the immediate environment and sparks questions about what could have been the cause of these scenes. Artur Barrio changes the normal familiar surroundings and attempts to transport the visitor (participant), possibly through a little discomfort, to a place where everything needs to be more deeply examined.\\n\\n\\n== Social/political context ==\\nFor much of Artur Barrio\\'s career, Brazil was in the hands of a military dictatorship after the coup d\\'état in 1964.\\nIn 1970 he created Situação…DEFL…+s+…ruas…Abril…(Unleashing confusion on the streets…Situation) consisting of “the placement of five hundred plastic bags containing blood, nails, dung, waste, and other debris in downtown Rio during the peak of the dictatorship’s repression”\\nAt the time of his (Situation T/T1) it was not uncommon for people to disappear. “Autonomous para-police forces (Death Squads) took on the work of “social cleansing”, eliminating delinquents, the marginalized and street children.”  His bloody packages question the status of those that have disappeared and bring into focus the “socially apprehensible possibilities of”  governments and other institutions.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic movements ==\\nArtur Barrio himself rejects art categories. In his “MANIFEST: against the art categories, against the salons, against the awards, against the jury, against the art critique” (Rio de Janeiro February 1970), Barrio explains his discontent with the top down view of art imposed by an aesthetic elite. In his view, this elite prescribes the materials necessary to create art. These materials were out of reach to Barrio and much of the population of the Third World at the time. His use of inexpensive materials (garbage, toilet paper and urine) was a rejection of the aesthetic elite and the art world they controlled, including the definitions of art categories, salons, awards, juried shows, and critics.\\nAlthough Barrio rejects art categories we can see that there are several ideas that he embraces that link him to Modernist movement. He was highly influenced by the Fluxus ideas, a group that took its name from the concept of “flow”. The idea that you could use whatever you have at hand to make art reflects the idea of anti-commercial art.  His work could also be seen as Neo-Dada in its rejection of the prevailing standards in art. He rejects the standard materials of an artist in favor of perishables. He also often rejected typical spaces, preferring to stage his Situations in public places. There are even influences of process art in the way that Barrio would, almost ritualistically, construct his packages (Situation T/T1). Almost all of the works of Artur Barrio are a form of Installation art.\\n\\n\\n== Interpretation of work ==\\nArtur Barrio does not see his work as the creation of a finished product. He is an interactive artist; he creates the situation where people interact with and react to artifacts that Barrio has put in place. One of his best known such works, Situação T/T1, (Unfolding of the Body Situation), was titled literally as a situation, not just a stagnant piece of art. In this work Barrio constructed \"bloody packages\" and tied them loosely. He then strategically placed these \"blood-stained rags (trouxas ensanguentadas) in a park to provoke public reactions before police arrived.\"\\nBarrio has always pushed the boundaries of what materials can be used in the production of art. He has used a variety of perishable materials like blood, nails, saliva, hair, urine, excrement, bones, toilet paper, tampons, used cotton, film negatives and other items. He defends using such materials with his idea that \"expensive materials are being imposed by an aesthetic thought of an elite that thinks from the top to the bottom.\"\\nBarrio has no interest in the preservation of his pieces since the art he is interested in is the experience of creating the art and the experience of interacting with art. To Barrio, the artifacts that are used to create these experiences are not the art and do not need to be preserved. \\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nArtur Barrio has become more accepting of the greater art community. His work (or replicas created as examples of his work) is now exhibited with increasing frequency. However, his attitude is not the main reason that Artur Barrio is now working within the larger established art community. The greater change was not in Artur Barrio but rather in the art word itself. Barrio still “views curators and institutions … as completely superfluous to requirements for works of art and exhibitions. In his eyes curators are reduced to the role of logistics co-ordinators and as such, the institution in turn becomes no more than a (temporary) channel for his work.”  However it is because of the work of Artur Barrio and many artists like him that Conceptual art and the use of untraditional media in art has become acceptable.\\nBarrio now exhibits his work internationally. \\n\\n\\n== Artworks ==\\nInterminável, (Interminable) 2005\\nSérie transportáveis, (Series you transported) 2003\\nIdéia Situação, (Idea Situation) 2002\\nUma Extensâo no Tempo (An Extension in the Time) 1995\\nA Cancela de Carne (The Gate of Meat) 1994\\nN.....S....F....O....A.....

       "  'William Powhida (born 1976) is an American visual artist and former art critic. Powhida\\'s work is critical and addresses the contemporary art world.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nPowhida received his Master of Fine Arts in painting from Hunter College in January, 2002.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nTopics have included creating an \"enemies\" list as well as letters addressed to contemporary curators (such as Zach Feuer Gallery), collectors and critics, requesting recognition. His 2009 piece \"Relational Wall\" includes portraits sourced from Artforum\\'s \"Scene & Herd\". He also produces portraits drawn entirely from memory.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\n\\nIn 2004, Powhida began compiling lists of enemies, rendering portraits of each enemy in graphite and gouache with insults written beneath each face. Few were spared from these lists, and his father is no exception, who is identified by the word \"failure\" under his portrait. These early works, which were in an exhibition at Platform Gallery as well as galleries in Williamsburg, display the physical evidence of the artist\\'s toil, measured in sweat and coffee stains left on the paper.\\nHe followed up his initial enemy lists with a Seattle Enemies List specific to the Pacific Northwest, targeting Tacoma-based artist Dale Chihuly and the Northern spotted owl among others. The 2006 exhibition at Platform gallery debuted a drawing of over 300 small head studies entitled Everyone I\\'ve ever Met from Memory (That I Can Remember), which Brooklyn Rail critic James Kalm described as a \"meta-drawing\" demonstrating a level of ambition and commitment to carry out the kind of stoner idea many people have but most would not actually do. The exhibition also included hex drawings of then United States president George W. Bush and New York-based gallerist Zach Feuer and a fictitious Artforum Top 10 penned by himself.\\nThe New York magazine blog was featured in a New York magazine front cover, for Powhida\\'s show at the Schroeder Romero Gallery (now Schroeder Romero & Shredder) in 2007. The work from his solo exhibition This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero includes a nine-page handwritten feature that plays on a feature Ariel Levy wrote about Dash Snow for the magazine. By this time he had developed a trompe-l\\'œil technique, rendering pages from magazines as well as sheets of blue-lined notebook paper as if torn from real-world sources and taped to the wall. These sheets of notebook paper with lists titled \"Proposals\" and \"Reasons\" offer a comically distorted worldview that blurs the lines of fact and fiction in an ego-driven celebrity art culture.\\nIn a 2009 drawing called \"Post-Boom Odds\", Powhida placed speculative bets on which young artists will matter in 10 years.\\n\\n\\n=== How The New Museum Committed Suicide With Banality ===\\nPowhida produced a drawing called \"How the New Museum Committed Suicide with Banality\" for the November 2009 cover of the Brooklyn Rail. The drawing was released in an edition of 20 prints sold by two galleries that represent Powhida, New York’s Schroeder Romero & Shredder and LA’s Charlie James.\\nThe name of the drawing was taken from a post on James Wagner\\'s blog. The work features caricatures of individuals involved in the controversial New Museum exhibition, including Jeff Koons as Howdy Doody, which Edward Winkleman remarked is ironic considering how much Powhida\\'s work owes to Koons. New Museum trustee at the center of the controversy, Dakis Joannou, bought a print of Powhida’s drawing from his New York dealer for $1,500.\\nDavid W. Kiehl, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said that drawings like this one, which accused the New Museum of cronyism, expose things that are undercover that people do not want to talk about.\\nPowhida later responded to criticism in an article published on the Art:21 blog.\\n\\n\\n=== Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville ===\\nAt Charlie James Gallery\\'s booth at the Pulse Art Fair, Powhida unveiled a 40 by 60 inch drawing he and artist Jade Townsend had produced called Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville, depicting an art world shantytown with artists, dealers, critics and curators gathering in food lines. The who\\'s who of the art world are assembled outside the convention center in which Art Basel Miami Beach is held, and which Powhida describes as \"the belly of the beast.\" In the bottom left corner, mega-collectors Marty Marguiles, Don Rubell, Charles Saatchi and Eli Broad place bets on a cockfight with miniature representations of Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons.\\nNew York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz described the drawing as \"a great big art world stink bomb\" and a much needed institutional critique. He suggested that a museum commission Powhida to produce a one-year-long project that would result in a fifteen feet high, twenty feet wide drawing of the art world as it is today.\\n\\n\\n=== #class ===\\n\\n#class was a month-long series of events at Winkleman Gallery in New York that took place between February 20 to March 20, 2010 organized by Powhida and artist Jennifer Dalton. #class invited guest artists, critics, academics, dealers, collectors and anyone else who would like to participate to examine the way art is made and seen in our culture and to identify and propose alternatives and/or reforms to the current market system.\\nPowhida has long collaborated with artist Jennifer Dalton, who worked with him to produce art world condolence cards for Art Basel in 2008 and co-directed a hypothetical, post-apocalyptic art gallery for Powhida\\'s exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nIn his review of Powhida\\'s 2009 exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall, Holland Cotter of the New York Times called Powhida an \"art world vigilante, virtuoso draftsman, compulsive calligrapher and fantasist autobiographer.\" Art critic Jerry Saltz called Powhida the second best thing to happen in 2009 in his assessment of art in New York that year, praising his drawing for the Brooklyn Rail as well as his spring exhibition at Schroeder Romero.\\nCritics have drawn comparisons between his art world diatribes and those of 18th and 19th century social critics and satirists William Hogarth, Honoré Daumier, Henri Meyer and Paul Iribe. Critics have also pointed out the site-specificity of his practice. For example, his 2009 exhibition at Charlie James Gallery drew on Los Angeles-based professional actors, voice talents, and film studios to produce his video \"Powhida (Trailer)\". Other works have investigated media portrayals of place when setting his works in New York, Seattle and Aspen, Colorado.\\nDamien Cave of the New York Times, who has called Powhida the \"gadfly of the art establishment,\" has pointed out that the artist\\'s own rising fame presents a problem for an artist who critiques the art market as feudal and celebrity obsessed. New York dealer-turned Museum of Contemporary Art director Jeffrey Deitch takes a similar stance, saying, \"The irony is that by exposing art celebrity culture, he\\'s becoming a celebrity himself... So hats off to him.\"\\nLeah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times has argued that there are two distinct voices in the artist\\'s work, both named William Powhida, Powhida the \"character\" and Powhida the \"author\". In a 2007 interview Powhida hinted at the idea, saying, \"I do a lot of writing, fiction.\"\\n\\n\\n== Lifestyle ==\\nIn the press release for This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero, Powhida wrote, \"I can\\'t keep sitting around my studio getting drunk and yelling at my assistants forever.\" He arrived at the opening for that exhibition with a black eye and a cut. After viewing a set of Powhida\\'s drawings about a night of hard drinking and bar fights, art critic James Kalm, taking the drawings at face value, offered the artist some personal advice on sobriety. Other accounts have described a more socially-responsible artist who works as a teacher at a public high-school in Brooklyn.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nIn 2007, Powhida collaborated with Jeff Parker on the book Back of the Line published by Decode. Regina Hackett of the Post-Intelligencer compared his facility to the \"damning exactitude of a police sketch artist.\" During a reading of the book in Seattle, Powhida and Parker attempted to orchestrate an attack on one of his own works.\\n\\n\\n== Quote ==\\nPowhida has been quoted on NPR as noting that \"in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christie\\'s in New York.\" He further  commented: \"If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nWilliam Powhida\\'s website\\nNew York Times Review for ABMB Hooverville\\nNew York Times Review for The Writing Is on the Wall\\nDavid Joselit\\'s review in Art Forum\\nreview by James Kalm in The Brooklyn Rail\\n[1] Schroeder Romero press release',\n",
       "  'Dame Rachel Whiteread  (born 20 April 1963) is an English artist who primarily produces sculptures, which typically take the form of casts. She was the first woman to win the annual Turner Prize in 1993.\\nWhiteread was one of the Young British Artists who exhibited at the Royal Academy\\'s Sensation exhibition in 1997. Among her most renowned works are House, a large concrete cast of the inside of an entire Victorian house; the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna, resembling the shelves of a library with the pages turned outwards; and Untitled Monument, her resin sculpture for the empty fourth plinth in London\\'s Trafalgar Square.\\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to art.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nWhiteread was born in 1963 in Ilford, Essex. Her mother, Patricia Whiteread (née Lancaster), who was also an artist, died in 2003 at the age of 72. Her father, Thomas Whiteread, was a geography teacher, polytechnic administrator and lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, who died when Whiteread was studying at art school in 1988. She is the third of three sisters – the older two being identical twins.\\nShe took a workshop on casting with the sculptor Richard Wilson and began to realize the possibilities in casting objects. She was briefly at the Cyprus College of Art. From 1985 to 1987 she studied sculpture at Slade School of Art, University College, London, where she was taught by Phyllida Barlow, graduating with an MA in 1987. Whiteread worked as an invigilator at the Serpentine Gallery.\\nFor a time she worked in Highgate Cemetery fixing lids back onto time-damaged coffins. She began to exhibit in 1987, with her first solo exhibition coming in 1988. She lives and works in a former synagogue in east London with long-term partner and fellow sculptor Marcus Taylor. They have two sons.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nMany of Whiteread\\'s works are casts of ordinary domestic objects and, in numerous cases, their so-called negative space. For example, she is known for making solid casts of the open space in and around pieces of furniture such as tables and chairs, architectural details and even entire rooms and buildings. She says the casts carry \"the residue of years and years of use.\" Whiteread mainly focuses on the line and the form for her pieces.\\nWhile still at the Slade, Whiteread cast domestic objects and created her first sculpture, Closet. She made a plaster cast of the interior of a wooden wardrobe and covered it with black felt. It was based on comforting childhood memories of hiding in a dark closet. After she graduated she rented space for a studio using the Enterprise Allowance Scheme. She created Shallow Breath (1988), the cast of the underside of a bed, made not long after her father died. Both sculptures were exhibited in her first solo show in 1988 along with casts of other domestic pieces. The work all sold and allowed her to apply for grants to find funding for larger sculptures.\\n\\n\\n=== Ghost ===\\nAfter her first solo exhibition, Whiteread decided to cast the space that her domestic objects could have inhabited. She applied for grants, describing the project as \"mummifying the air in a room.\" She completed Ghost in 1990. It was cast from a room in a house on Archway Road in north London, much like the house she grew up in. The road was being widened, and the house was torn down. She used plaster to cast the parlor walls and ceiling in sections and assembled them on a metal frame.\\nGhost was first shown at the nonprofit Chisenhale Gallery. It was purchased by Charles Saatchi and included with other works by Whiteread in his first \"Young British Art\" show in 1992. In May 2004 a fire in a Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including, it is believed, some by Whiteread. However, Ghost had recently been moved from the warehouse to the new Gagosian Gallery in London. The work was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in the autumn of 2004. According to the National Gallery, \"She has worked on every scale, defining the space between positives and negatives, public and private, and manufactured and handmade objects, always with concision, intelligence, beauty, and power.\"\\n\\n\\n=== House and the Turner Prize ===\\nIn October 1993 Whiteread completed House, the cast of a Victorian terrace house. She had begun considering casting an entire house in 1991. She and James Lingwood of Artangel looked at houses to be torn down in North and East London in 1992, but without success in securing one. During this period in 1992 and 1993, Whiteread had an artist residency in Berlin with a scholarship from the DAAD Artist\\'s Programme. While in Berlin, she created Untitled (Room), the cast of a generic, anonymous room that she built herself. She finished the interior of a room-sized box with wallpaper, windows, and door before casting. The sculpture is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\\nHouse, perhaps her best-known work, was a concrete cast of the inside of an entire Victorian terraced house completed in autumn 1993, exhibited at the location of the original house – 193 Grove Road – in East London (all the houses in the street had earlier been knocked down by the council). It drew mixed responses, winning her both the Turner Prize for the best young British artist in 1993 and the K Foundation art award for the worst British artist. She was the first woman to win a Turner Prize. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council demolished House on 11 January 1994, a decision which caused some controversy itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Untitled (One Hundred Spaces) (1997) ===\\nFor the Sensation exhibition in 1997, Whiteread exhibited Untitled (One Hundred Spaces), a series of resin casts of the space underneath chairs. This work can be seen as a descendant of Bruce Nauman\\'s concrete cast of the area under his chair of 1965.\\nThe critical response included:\\n\\n\"like a field of large glace sweets, it is her most spectacular, and benign installation to date [...] Monuments to domesticity, they are like solidified jellies, opalescent ice-cubes, or bars of soap – lavender, rose, spearmint, lilac. They look like a regulated graveyard or a series of futuristic standing stones with a passing resemblance to television sets.\"\\n\\n— Andrew Lambirth, The Spectator, 12 October 1996.\\n\\n\\n=== Water Tower ===\\nIn 1998, Whiteread made Water Tower as part of a grant for New York City\\'s Public Art Fund. The piece, which is 12\\' 2\" and 9\\' in diameter, was a translucent resin cast of a water tower installed on a rooftop in New York City\\'s SoHo district. It has been called \"an extremely beautiful object, which changes colour with the sky, and also a very appropriate one, celebrating one of the most idiosyncratic and charming features of the New York skyline.\" The piece is now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Just as Ghost led on to the larger and better known House, so Water Tower led to the more public Trafalgar Square plinth work three years later.\\n\\n\\n=== Holocaust Monument a.k.a. Nameless Library (2000) ===\\n\\nDuring the Holocaust, 65,000 Austrian Jews were executed, and in memory, Monument to the Victims of Fascism was a monument erected to commemorate these lost lives, however, this piece was seen as unsatisfying, so Simon Wiesenthal proposed the idea for a new memorial to the mayor of Vienna. With the condition that this memorial could not be figurative and needed to represent all 65,000 lives and the camps they were executed at, Rachel Whiteread was chosen out of ten artists to create this monument. Her monument Nameless Library was erected in Judenplatz Square in Vienna and appears to be an inside-out library. This structure was built from positively cast cement books which are placed with their spines facing inward. The inability to read these books allude to the lost lives of the 65,000 Austrian Jews whose stories are unable to be told leaving the viewer with a sense of loss and absence. These books have also been seen as referring to the Nazi book burnings. The sculpture also does not include corners or bookshelves which further symbolizes the lack of structure and support.\\nNameless Library also is constructed on the excavation grounds of Vienna\\'s oldest synagogues which caused a lot of criticism towards the piece as many citizens felt that the grounds sufficed for the memorial itself. Some critics even accused her of stereotyping the Jewish people as \"the people of the book\" considering that Jewish memorials were traditionally written. This monument also questions the architectural concepts of interior and exterior as the building surrounding the square form walls, and the streets leading into it like doorways. In addition, the inverted rose ceiling works as a drainage point to the interior of the sculpture.\\n\\n\\n=== Untitled Monument (2001) ===\\nWith Untitled Monument (2001), (also variously known as Plinth or Inverted Plinth), Whiteread became the third artist to provide a sculpture for the empty Fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. Her sculpture was an 11-ton resin cast of the plinth itself, made by Mike Smith Studio, London, which stood upside down, creating a sort of mirror-image of the plinth. It was said to be the most massive object ever made out of resin, taking eight attempts to produce due to the resin cracking.\\nThe work was produced in two halves, and surface blisters of the cast were repaired by picking them off and filling the small craters with a syringe of resin. Unusually for a public work, she raised funds for the piece herself by selling maquettes (small preparatory models); this was no small gesture with the mold alone costing over £100,000 and the total cost estimated at £225,000\\nThe critical response included:\\n\\n\"This dazzling anti-monument monument looks like a glass coffin, but its watery transparency relates to the large fountain that dominates the Trafalgar plaza. Following the aquatic theme, Whiteread\\'s Monument evokes the scene of the 1805 naval battle for which the square is named.\"\\n\\n— David Ebony, Artnet\\n\\n\"It\\'s a simple trick, but an effective one, and the associations it conjures – heaviness and lightness, earth and heaven, death and life – are thought-provoking and manifold [...] Whiteread\\'s Monument, as light and gleaming as the plinth is dark and squat, is the only one of the four commissioned pieces to allude directly to the plinth\\'s defining emptiness. She sees it not as a space to be filled, but as an absence to be acknowledged, and she does it well.\"\\n\\n— Ned Denny, New Statesman, 9 July 2001.\\n\\n\\n=== Snow Show (2004) ===\\n\\n\"The challenge has been to work in collaboration with an architect [Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa] in a completely unfamiliar material. At this point, there is a 3-dimensional model of an actual stairwell space in East London, electronic imagery and a wooden mould that is being constructed in Rovaniemi, Finland. I know that the piece will be made from snow and will have a feeling of solidity; the viewer will be able to walk into it. The form is based upon a simple stairwell space that has been turned by 90 degrees. The exterior of the piece is a pragmatic solution simply reflecting the complex geometry of the interior. The new space should feel familiar and domestic. I hope that it will disorientate the viewer and make one think of other places.\"\\n\\n— Rachel Whiteread\\n\"\\'It was the ephemerality that appealed to me,\\' says Rachel Whiteread. \\'It was a chance to do an experiment.\\'\"\\n\\n— Rachel Whiteread\\n\\n\\n=== Embankment (2005–2006) ===\\n\\nIn spring 2004, she was offered the annual Unilever series commission to produce a piece for Tate Modern\\'s vast Turbine Hall, delaying acceptance for five to six months until she was confident she could conceive of a work to fill the space. Throughout the latter half of September 2005 and mid-way through October her work Embankment was installed and was made public on 10 October.\\nIt consists of some 14,000 translucent, white polyethylene boxes (themselves casts of the inside of cardboard boxes) stacked in various ways; some in very tall mountain-like peaks and others in lower (though still over human height), rectangular, more leveled arrangements. They are fixed in position with an adhesive. She cited the end scenes of both Raiders of the Lost Ark and Citizen Kane as visual precursors; she also spoke of the death of her mother and a period of upheaval which involved packing and moving comparable boxes.\\nIt is also thought that her recent trip to the Arctic is an inspiration, although critics counter that white is merely the colour the polyethylene comes in, and it would have added significantly to the expense to dye them.  The boxes were manufactured from casts of ten plain cardboard boxes by a company that produces grit bins and traffic bollards.\\nThe critical response included:\\n\\n\"With this work Whiteread has deepened her game, and made a work as rich and subtle as it is spectacular. Whatever else it is, Embankment is generous and brave, a statement of intent.\"\\n\\n— Adrian Searle, The Guardian, 11 October 2005.\\n\\n\"Everything feels surprisingly domestic in scale, the intimidating vistas of the Turbine Hall shrunk down to irregular paths and byways. From atop the walkway, it looks like a storage depot that is steadily losing the plot; from inside, as you thread your way between the mounds of blocks, it feels more like an icy maze.\"\\n\\n— Andrew Dickson, The Guardian, 10 October 2005.\\n\\n\"This is another example of meritless gigantism that could be anywhere, and is the least successful of the gallery\\'s six attempts to exploit its most unsympathetic space,\"\\n\\n— Brian Sewell, London Evening Standard, October 2005.\\n\\n\"[looks] like a random pile of giant sugar cubes [...] Luckily, the £400,000 sponsored work is recyclable.\"\\n\\n— Stephen Moyes, Daily Mirror, 11 October 2005.\\n\\n\\n=== Charity Box (2007) ===\\nWhiteread created this small, plaster sculpture for a charity auction by the Prior Weston PTA, in support of the Prior Weston primary school in Islington, London.\\nThe piece measures, a comparatively tiny, 16 cm x 11.5 cm x 11.5 cm.\\n\\n\\n=== Angel of the South (2008) ===\\nShe was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Angel of the South project in January 2008.\\n\\n\\n=== The Gran Boathouse (2010) ===\\nThe Gran Boathouse is located on the waters edge in Gran Norway. From a distance, it looks like any other boathouse, but closer inspection reveals that this is a work of art in concrete. The work is a cast of the interior of an old boathouse. Whiteread turns the boathouse inside out thereby capturing a moment in time. In this way, she encourages us to reflect on what we see around us. \"I have mummified the air inside the boathouse,\" says Rachel Whiteread. \"I wanted to make a shy sculpture, a sculpture that would stand there peaceful and noble.\" The boathouse and its interior had all the qualities that she was looking for. It represented the history of the place. The sculpture is preserving what would otherwise have been lost.\\n\\n\\n=== Rachel Whiteread Drawings (2010) ===\\nThe Hammer Museum exhibited Whiteread\\'s first museum retrospective of works on paper in 2010. The exhibition traveled to the Nasher Sculpture Center and the Tate Britain.\\n\\n\\n=== Work since 2012 ===\\nCast from generic wooden sheds, Detached 1, Detached 2, and Detached 3 (2012) render the empty interior of a garden shed in concrete and steel. Circa 1665 (I) (2012), LOOK, LOOK, LOOK (2012) and Loom (2012) belong to a series cast from doors and windows in shades of rose, eau-de-nil, or steely resin. Propped against or affixed to walls, the sculptures glow with absorbed and reflected light.\\nOther works like Untitled (Amber) (2012) and Untitled (Green) (2012) are diminutive cardboard constructions mounted on graphite-marked notepaper, painted with silver leaf and complete with celluloid \"windows\" that refer to the resin sculptures.\\n\\n\\n=== Cabin (2016) ===\\nCabin is a concrete reverse cast of a wooden shed. It has been located on Discovery Hill on Governors Island in New York Harbour since 2016. Whiteread uses this idea in order to produce a negative space that had existed but no longer does. Since Cabin is away from the noisy city, it creates a peaceful scene and a quiet sense. Cabin is said to be her first public commission in the United States that is installed permanently on the island.\\nWith this work, Whiteread wanted to \"blur the notion of space even further by allowing the booming nature of the park to and hide the installation.\" Therefore, even though the city that is so advanced with technology and is polluted by gasoline, \"nature is still present.\"\\n\\n\"What an extraordinary site, and what an honor to be asked to put something there,\" Whiteread states. \\'I tried to imagine what one could sit there with some kind of dignity, to create a place of remembrance.\" She would like \"to make a piece that was evocative without wanting to make a memorial to the World Trade Center.\"\\n\\n- Rachel Whiteread\\n\\n\\n== Other commissions ==\\nIn 2023, Whiteread created a 31 feet tall Christmas tree covered by 102 circular neon white hoops for Carlos Place outside The Connaught hotel in London\\'s Mayfair district which commissioned the piece.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBradley, Fiona, ed.

       "  'Yasumasa Morimura (森村 泰昌, Morimura Yasumasa, born June 11, 1951) is a contemporary Japanese performance and appropriation artist whose work encompasses photography, film, and live performance. He is known for his reinterpretation of recognizable artworks and figures from art history, history, and mass media through his adoption of personas that transcend national, ethnic, gendered, and racial boundaries. Across his photographic and performative series, Morimura\\'s works explore a number of interconnected themes, including: the nature of identity and its ability to undergo change, postcolonialism, authorship, and the Western view of Japan – and Asia, more broadly – as feminine.\\nOriginally intent on channeling his creative energy into black-and-white still life photography, Morimura struggled to ascertain his identity and decided to visualize this inner struggle through self-portraiture. In 1985, Portrait (Van Gogh), marked the first of dozens of self-portraits Morimura completed in which he adopted the role of established artists, major historical figures, celebrated popular culture icons, and identifiable subjects from well-known artworks.\\nSince the 1980s, Morimura\\'s artistic process entails a rigorous system in which he transforms his entire body into a nearly identical replica of his designated subject through elaborate costumes, makeup, props, and set designs. Once digital photography and computer editing software became more accessible and refined in the late-1990s, Morimura\\'s works demonstrate greater visual complexity in his manipulation of composition, lighting, and the number of figures he portrays within a single artwork.\\nFor the last two and a half decades, Morimura has brought his personas to life in short video, film, and live performances in which he expresses their thoughts through movement and scripted monologues.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education (1951–1978) ==\\nYasumasa Morimura was born in Osaka, Japan in 1951 to father Nobuo (died in 2006) and mother Hiroko (died in 2016).\\nFollowing the end of the American Occupation of Japan in 1952, Morimura grew up in a generation that embraced Western values and cultural trends that came to define Japan\\'s Post-World War II period. His continual exposure to Western, particularly American, socio-cultural customs in music, film, and fashion would later influence his artistic pursuits in the 1980s.\\nIn the mid-1970s, Morimura enrolled in the Kyoto City University of Art, where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978. During his studies, an early interest in photography emerged after he took a course taught by Life magazine photographer Y. Ernest Satow (1927–1990). Satow lectured on the Modern Western aesthetic ideals of photography and camera techniques, particularly as it was exemplified in the works of the French Humanist photographer Henri-Cartier Bresson.\\n\\n\\n== Early career (1978–1988) ==\\nFollowing graduation, Satow hired Morimura to work as a photography assistant. Through this employment experience, Morimura produced his first artworks which were black-and-white still life images mainly shot indoors. These encompassed his Barco negro na mesa series from the early-1980s. However, he incorporated an additional layer of creativity through his photographs of sculptural assemblages he designed from found objects.\\nOne of these works, Tabletop City (Arch of Triumph) (1984), is a vertical photographic composition in which a fork occupies the center plane as it leans against a conical glass with a light bulb inside of it. Morimura\\'s careful arrangement of found objects grew more complex as seen in a photograph he took of a tall, slender tower made from dice, cut out letters, and a painted board.\\nIn 1985, Morimura shifted his attention to self-portraiture after he contemplated the precise nature of his Asian identity. Reflecting on the motivations behind this thematic approach, Morimura recalled the questions he raised at this moment: “Who am I? My face is Asian, but I am increasingly living in a western style? Can I say I am Japanese?”.\\nIn tandem with these pressing questions, Morimura\\'s understanding of Modern Japanese history was equally influential on the change in his creative focus. He has regularly cited the evolving lifestyle of the Meiji Emperor Mutsuhito in which he was raised to act feminine during the Shogunate\\'s rule but later adopted a more militaristic image and masculine personality once he ascended to the imperial throne. Morimura noted that the Emperor\\'s sudden change in appearance signified that this is an example of how easily one can transform their identity instantaneously through different apparel. From here, Morimura began to question if a change in clothing could truly make a person feel like someone completely different.\\nMorimura created his first self-portraits in which he portrayed the Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh and his sitter Camille Roulin in 1985. These photorealistic engagements with van Gogh\\'s paintings marked the first instance of Morimura challenging the malleability of identity formation. Subsequently, Morimura participated with fellow artists Tomoaki Ishihara and Hiroshi Kimura in a three-person group exhibition at Kyoto\\'s Galerie 16 in 1985, Smile with Radical Will, where he first exhibited his van Gogh and Roulin self-portraits.\\nA watershed moment in Morimura\\'s career occurred in 1988 when he created Portrait (Futago), a modern recreation of Édouard Manets\\'s controversial 1863 painting Olympia. Morimura positions himself in the roles of both the reclining white Olympia figure and her black maidservant and he replaces part of the surroundings with distinctly Japanese attributes as seen in the golden crane bed linens and the maneki-neko (“beckoning cat” figure said to symbolize good luck). Morimura supplanting both the white and black female subjects with his male Asian body was significant for its subversion of a work considered a staple of the Western Art History canon. The photograph addresses the issues of the male gaze and objectification of the female body, and it simultaneously brings to light the ignorance toward nonwhite subjects in Art History. By occupying the roles of the two sole figures, Morimura renders himself unavoidable for viewers to observe.\\nMorimura\\'s art attracted global attention after he was invited to exhibit his self-portraits for Japan at the 43rd Venice Biennale in their Aperto section. The opportunity to participate in this prestigious international art fair rapidly catapulted Morimura\\'s status to world art icon that soon led to his participation in dozens of group and solo exhibitions throughout Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia at the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s.\\n\\n\\n== Career success and development (1988–2000) ==\\n\\nAlthough the 1988 Venice Biennale was responsible for officially launching Morimura\\'s career on an international scale, his 1990 solo exhibition Daughter of Art History at the Sagacho Exhibit Space in Tokyo led to his popularity within the Japanese art world. The exhibition\\'s theme centered on Morimura\\'s critique of the Art History canon in which he deconstructed Western notions of aesthetic beauty, and examined Japan\\'s longstanding interest in Western culture. The success of Daughter of Art History was later revived in future exhibitions, most notably in 1999 at Luhring Augustine Gallery in New York.\\nJapanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky was a traveling exhibition held at the Guggenheim, Yokohama Museum of Art, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from 1994 to 1995. As the first historical survey of Post-1945 avant-garde Japanese art, Morimura\\'s selection as a participant in this landmark exhibition attracted positive attention from arts & culture publications. The New York Times art critic Holland Cotter lauded Morimura as a “star” and New York Magazine\\'s Mark Stevens highlighted his ability to effectively cross-fertilize “language, image, culture, and object” in his Playing with Gods (Night) (1991).\\nFrom 1994 to 1996, Morimura produced his Actress series in which he portrays mid-20th Century American and European actresses and film characters situated in Japanese locales. In Self-Portrait – Actress After Jodie Foster 2 (1996), Morimura fashions himself after Jodie Foster\\'s prostitute character from Taxi Driver (1976) while seated on a red stool in an urban Tokyo alleyway littered with packets of cigarettes.\\nHowever, Morimura did not only restrict his Actress subjects to still photography as he breathed life into his roles through both live performance and a short film.\\nIn 1995, Morimura had a video recorded in which the camera shows the massive Yasuda Auditorium classroom at Tokyo University\\'s Komaba campus as students sit at their desks and prepare for their professor\\'s lecture. Unbeknownst to them, Morimura arrives dressed as Marilyn Monroe (who he refers to as “Actress M”) and proceeds to run around shouting and gesticulating before standing atop a desk at the front of the room. Morimura strikes a pose that mimics Monroe\\'s famous performance in The Seven Year Itch (1955). Although he was in character as a white, female American actress, the performance was both a reference to and an indirect recreation of the right-wing writer Yukio Mishima\\'s infamous debate with the left-wing student group Zenkyōtō that occurred in the same auditorium on May 13, 1969. While Morimura admitted he did not research the event in great detail, he has continually referenced how Mishima\\'s theatrically expressive opposition to the “cultural castration” and consumerism of Japan moved him to consider the importance of art\\'s authenticity in a Japanese context. As a commentary on Mishima\\'s vehement opposition to the perceived feminization of Japan in the Post-World War II era, Morimura decided to reinterpret the event from the polar opposite standpoint of a recognizably female subject and symbol of popular media consumption, Marilyn Monroe.\\nIn preparation for the Yokohama Museum of Art\\'s exhibition The Sickness Unto Beauty – Self-portrait as Actress (April 1996 – June 1996), Morimura was commissioned to appear in a short film as part of the show\\'s focus on his recent Actress series. The experimental filmmaker Takashi Itoh directed Apparatus M (1996) that features Morimura as Marilyn Monroe. The film was screened in a classic-style theater venue contained within the museum\\'s exhibition space to evoke the connections between Monroe and the filmgoing culture of the Golden Age of Hollywood.\\nFor Fall-Winter 1996–7, the Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake invited Morimura to create a design to be printed on garments from Miyake\\'s first \"Guest Artists\" collaboration. Miyake\\'s manifesto was to produce clothing offering an “interactive relationship between art and the person who admires it,” and Morimura provided Miyake with collages reproducing Ingres\\'s 1856 nude painting La Source, and self-portraits showing himself inverted and draped in red tulle. Another design showed the nude Morimura emerging from behind a life-sized cutout of La Source.\\n\\n\\n== Career (2000–present) ==\\nStarting in the late-1990s, advancements in digital camera and computer technology permitted Morimura a broader range of creative tools to visually manipulate and alter his portrait compositions and subjects’ appearances such as Photoshop.\\nThere are multiple examples of works in which Morimura inserted his countenance onto non-human subjects. Singing Sunflowers (1998) is a color photograph print based on Vincent van Gogh\\'s still life Sunflowers (1888) in that it retains the exact same floral arrangement, color palette, and interior space from the original painting. However, Morimura digitally replicates his face to appear on each of the sunflowers’ heads at different angles.\\nIn tandem with his art, Morimura was appointed as a professor at Kyoto University of Art and Design\\'s International Research Center for the Arts from 2004 to 2006. Alongside the artists Hiroshi Senju and Tatsuo Miyajima, he was selected as an artist-in-residence in which he was tasked with educating University-level visual arts fellows. The intent of the program was to foster a new generation of artistic production in Kyoto that could be shared with the rest of the world.\\nMorimura\\'s Requiem series (2006) denoted a significant shift in the content of his self-portraits. With an embedded interest in Modern Japanese and world history, Morimura was attracted to specific historical figures and how their power and influence shaped their national surroundings. This marked a brief departure from Morimura\\'s typically female and Art History-rooted subjects in that he chose to portray masculine figures: Japanese right-wing writer and political agitator Yukio Mishima, actor Charlie Chaplin as a parodic Adolf Hitler from The Great Dictator (1940), Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, and Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong.\\nIn December 2012, a formal announcement revealed that Morimura was selected as the artistic director of the 2014 installment of the Yokohama Triennale art festival.\\nMorimura debuted his first feature-length film, Ego Symposium, in 2016. Returning to the Art History-laden content of his work from the 1980s to the 2000s, Morimura embodies the roles of eleven distinguished artists from the Art History canon: Andy Warhol, Frida Kahlo, Vincent van Gogh, Johannes Vermeer, Diego Velazquez, Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Durer, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Louise Vigee Le Brun. This moving image work consists of vignettes in which each of the artists deliver a dramatic monologue on the nature of selfhood, identity, and how it relates to their artistry. As a humorous statement on self, Morimura expresses in the opening that Marcel Duchamp will be referenced but that “... because Mr. Duchamp is of the opinion that absence is a testament to existence, he will not be joining us today”; in his place, Morimura inserts himself as both a character and the moderator of the meeting between the eleven artists.\\nSimilar to Ego Symposium’s filmic format, Nippon Cha Cha Cha! (2018) is a multimedia work that combines film and live theatrical performance. Morimura portrays a diverse set of characters in an assessment of how Japan’s identity is shaped by American culture following the end of the Allied Occupation in 1952. As Showa Emperor Hirohito, General Douglas MacArthur, actress Marilyn Monroe, and writer Yukio Mishima, the work is a blend of historical and autobiographical references. During one of the film’s scenes, Morimura recreates the historic photograph of the meeting between Emperor Hirohito and General MacArthur but switches the original location from the American ambassador’s residence to his childhood home and parents’ tea shop. These scenes were intended to signify Morimura\\'s understanding of the complex relationship between America\\'s influence on Japanese culture and how it led to his internal conflict as to what it means to identify as “Japanese” in the 20th and 21st Centuries. During the live performance component, Morimura enters the stage wearing the same military uniform as Mishima and is armed with a scroll. Before the audience, Morimura reads a declaration that argues for the essentiality of art as a reference to the politically charged speech Mishima delivered on fascism at Tokyo\\'s Ground Self-Defense Force camp before he committed ritualistic suicide on November 25, 1970.\\nAlthough Morimura\\'s art has been the subject of dozens of group and solo exhibitions around the world since his public debut in the 1980s, the 2018 retrospective of his career at The Japan Society, Yasumasa Morimura: Ego Obscura (October 2018 – January 2019), was his first institutional solo exhibition in New York and was met with all-around praise by art critics and publications, from The New York Times and The Brooklyn Rail, to Hyperallergic and The Eye of Photography.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nMorimura presently lives and works in his native Osaka, and he is married to Toshimi Takahara.\\n\\n\\n== Style, content, and themes ==\\n\\n\\n=== Style and content ===\\nAs both a performance and appropriation artist, Morimura\\'s art is defined by his assumption of the identities of famous artists, artwork subjects, historical figures, and popular culture icons. In order to evoke the identity of his respective roles, Morimura recreates these images through extensive makeup and props before situating them in settings with which they would be associated or locations that are completely foreign to their identity. In Vermeer Study: A Great Story out of the Corner of a Small Room (2004), the content is a faithful reproduction of the interior space and figures from Dutch Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer\\'s The Art of Painting (1666–1668).\\nWhen he recreates subjects from paintings, Morimura replicates the precise surface details and brushstroke textures inherent in the original works. Based on Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh\\'s renowned Self-Portrait (1889), Morimura\\'s face is covered in splotches and remnants of golden yellow paint while his clothing contains mixtures of green and blue paint that complements the swirling blue-green curved forms behind him; this photographic staging echoes van Gogh\\'s painterly impasto technique.\\nOften, art historians and critics have described his self-portraits as a form of parody. The photograph Self-Portrait: White Marilyn 2 (1996) is regularly cited as an example of this characterization as Morimura wears a blonde wig and white dress that is visually reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe\\'s hairstyle and wardrobe while he reenacts her famous scene from The Seven Year Itch (1955) when her character embarrassingly attempts to hold down her dress as it blows above her knees.\\n\\n\\n=== Themes ===\\nIdentity exploration is the main, overarching theme that predominates the scope of Morimura\\'s art, and it encompasses an analysis of multiple identities that often intersect within works: ethnicity, nationality, gender & sexuality, race, etc. In his Actress series (1994 – 1996), Morimura depicted himself as a number of American and European actresses: Audrey Hepburn, Marlene Dietrich, Jodie Foster, Brigitte Bardot, Marilyn Monroe, et al. This series challenged the notions of the male gaze as Morimura purposefully inserts his male Japanese identity into photographic recreations of world famous white, female cinema icons.\\nThrough his continual engagement with the Art History canon, postcolonialism and the feminization of Asia are recurring themes that have persisted. The association of Japan and Asia as a feminized space was a 19th Century Euro-American perception that utilized gendered binaries to explain the differences between Western and Eastern cultures: Western civilization demonstrated masculine dominance for its massive military industrial complex and imperialist ambitions, whereas Asia was deemed powerless, poor, and weak, but viewed positively as exotic for its indigenous art, decoration, and fashion. Completed thirty years apart, Morimura\\'s two versions of Edouard Manet\\'s Olympia (1863) both examine the legacies of postcolonialism and the historic view of Asia-as-female. Portrait (Futago) (1988) degrades the Western male gaze through the portrayal of the white reclining Olympia and her black maidservant with that of a male Japanese figure in their positions. Une Moderne Olympia (2018) further pushes the boundaries on Morimura\\'s first redesign of the Manet painting in which he now transforms Olympia into a Japanese woman with the accoutrements of a geisha, a historic Western stereotype and mythologizing signifier of Japanese womanhood. The black maidservant is replaced with a European man donning an elegant black top hat and matching gloves as he presents the geisha with a bouquet of flowers. The encroaching male behind the geisha interrogates the violent implications of the male gaze as both a literal objectification of women and a figurative raping of Japanese culture.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n1996: Apparatus M\\n2016: Ego Symposium\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nSelect Museums, Galleries, and Arts & Culture Institutions\\nCarnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu; International Center of Photography, Chicago; J.

       "  'Eija-Liisa Ahtila (born 1959 in Hämeenlinna, Finland) is a contemporary visual artist and filmmaker who lives and works in Helsinki.\\nAhtila is most known for her multi-panel cinematic installations. She experiments with narrative storytelling in her films and cinematic installations. In her earlier works, she dealt with the topic of unsettling human dramas at the center of personal relationships, dealing with teenage sexuality, family relationships, mental disintegration, and death. Her later works, however, pursue more profound artistic questions where she investigates the processes of perception and attribution of meaning, at times in the light of larger cultural and existential themes, like colonialism, faith and posthumanism.\\nAhtila has participated in numerous international art exhibitions such as Manifesta (1998), the Venice Biennale (1999 and 2005), documenta 11 (2002), São Paulo Art Biennial (2008) and the Sydney Biennale in 2002 and 2018.\\nAhtila has won several art and film awards, including the inaugural Vincent Award (2000), Artes Mundi (2006), Prince Eugen Medal (2008), and most recently Art Academic in Finland (2009).\\nHer work is held in the collections of the Tate and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. She is a former professor at the Department of Time and Space-based Art at the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts (Finland).\\n\\n\\n== Artistic career ==\\nWriting in the journal PAJ, Jane Philbrick describes Ahtila\\'s films as \"Smart, emotionally arresting, engaging, affective.\" Philbrick continues, saying, \"A self-described \\'teller of human dramas\\', she approaches narrative equipped with a rigorous arsenal of postmodern strategies ... One of her most potent tools, however, is a two-centuries-old dramatic genre of proven emotional reach and punch, melodrama.\" Although done in a more sophisticated way than conventional melodramas, Ahtila\\'s work likewise exaggerates plots and characters to affect the viewer\\'s emotions, with less appeal to immediate intellectual comprehension.\\nIn 1993, Ahtila created the three mini-films Me/We, Okay, and Gray: Each of these 90-second mini-films was shown separately and as a trilogy, as trailers in cinemas, on television during commercial breaks and in art galleries. Ahtila explores questions of identity and group relations through her use of narrative conventions derived from film, television and advertising. In Me/We the father of a family speaks about his family in a monologue and other players mouth his words. When the father speaks about his family members\\' emotions, their personalities mix together and become inseparable.\\nIn Okay a woman is speaking about violence in man and woman relationship and as she steps across the room like a tiger in a cage, her voice goes up and shows pure violence.\\nIn Gray three women in a lift go down into the water and talk about the atomic explosion and its effects, while words and pictures mix identity crisis and an atomic disaster.\\nIn 2002, Ahtila created a film called The House, for which she performed research that included conducting interviews with people who are afflicted by psychotic mental disorders. The film begins with a woman driving to a secluded house, and as events continue they take on a dreamlike state. The sounds become disorienting and the images begin to combine: the woman can see the car on the walls of the house; she hears boat horns that make no sense. The film is meant to be presented in an exhibit that displays each of the three screens on separate walls, making the viewer feel as if they are actually in the house where the project was filmed.\\nIn 2002 she had a solo show at Tate Modern, and in 2006 her multi-screen video piece The Wind (2006) was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). She has also had solo shows at the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, the Parasol Unit in London, ACMI in Melbourne and DHC/ART in Montreal.\\nAmong Ahtila\\'s many other works is The Hour of Prayer, first presented in 2005 at the Venice Biennale in Italy. The film is a four-channel video project that shows scenes from a woman\\'s experience surrounding the death of her dog. Bridget Goodbody, writing for Time Out New York, says that it presents \"a nonnarrative cycle of apparently random, but nonetheless consequential scenes.\" Some of those scenes show how, when she was away from her dog, he fell through the ice of a frozen pond, breaking his leg. Another shows the dog brought to a veterinarian for treatment of the injury; a diagnosis of bone cancer is made. After the dog dies, the film presents scenes of the woman moving on with her life, living as an artist in Africa.\\nAnother of her films, which debuted in 2009, is Where is Where?. New York\\'s Museum of Modern Art, which housed the seven-day exhibition, called it, \"a haunting and layered consideration of how history affects our perception of reality.\" In the film, a present-day poet, with the assistance of a figure who is the personification of death, investigates a murder committed fifty years ago. Two young Arab boys had killed their French friend during the Algerian War of Independence. As the poet investigates, images from the past and present begin to mix and collide; at one point the poet discovers the two boys seated in a boat, in the small swimming pool behind his house.\\nIn 2011 Ahtila\\'s exhibition horizontal first showed at the Marian Goodman Gallery. This piece is a 6 projection instillation showing a pine tree. Each projection shows a different part of the tree. Ahtila distorts the pine tree with tilts of the camera and different coloring for each projection.\\nAlthough Ahtila\\'s films do include more than one character, they tend to focus on the internal experience of just one person. Her work seems to be more about studying and understanding an individual\\'s subjective experience, and how the influences around individuals shape who they are and what they do, and shape their unconscious selves. She is greatly interested in the factors that go into the construction of personal identity, and in how fluid that construct can be. Ahtila wants to explore, as she says, \"how the subconscious is inherited in some way,\" citing as an example, \"[the way] in which my mother is physically present in myself and I am present in her.\"\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Installations ===\\nMe/We, Okay, Grey (1993), 3-channel monitor installation with furniture\\nIf 6 was 9 (1995), 3-channel projected installation\\nToday (1996), 3-channel projected installation\\nAnne, Aki and God (1998), 5-monitor & 2-screen installation with furniture\\nConsolation Service (1999), 2-channel projected installation\\nThe Present (2001), 5-channel monitor installation with furniture\\nThe House (2002), 3-channel projected installation\\nThe Wind (2002), 3-channel projected installation\\nSculpture in the Age of Posthumanism (2004), a sculpture which includes the viewer\\nThe Hour of Prayer (2005), 4-channel projected installation\\nFishermen / Études N°1 (2007), single channel projected installation\\nWhere is Where?

       "  'Jean-Michel Basquiat (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl baskja]; December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist who rose to success during the 1980s as part of the Neo-expressionism movement.\\nBasquiat first achieved notoriety in the late 1970s as part of the graffiti duo SAMO, alongside Al Diaz, writing enigmatic epigrams all over Manhattan, particularly in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop culture. By the early 1980s, his paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in Documenta in Kassel, Germany. At 22, he became one of the youngest to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial in New York. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his artwork in 1992.\\nBasquiat\\'s art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of racism.\\nSince his death at the age of 27 in 1988, Basquiat\\'s work has steadily increased in value. In 2017, Untitled, a 1982 painting depicting a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, sold for a record-breaking $110.5 million, becoming one of the most expensive paintings ever purchased.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life: 1960–1977 ===\\nBasquiat was born on December 22, 1960, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York City, the second of four children to Matilde Basquiat (née Andrades, 1934–2008) and Gérard Basquiat (1930–2013). He had an older brother, Max, who died shortly before his birth, and two younger sisters, Lisane (b. 1964) and Jeanine (b. 1967). His father was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and his mother was born in Brooklyn to Puerto Rican parents. He was raised Catholic.\\nMatilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to local art museums and enrolling him as a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Basquiat was a precocious child who learned to read and write by the age of four. His mother encouraged her son\\'s artistic talent and he often tried to draw his favorite cartoons. In 1967, he started attending Saint Ann\\'s School, a private school. There he met his friend Marc Prozzo and together they created a children\\'s book, written by Basquiat at the age of seven and illustrated by Prozzo.\\nIn 1968, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street at the age of seven. His arm was broken and he suffered several internal injuries, which required a splenectomy. While he was hospitalized, his mother brought him a copy of Gray\\'s Anatomy to keep him occupied. After his parents separated that year, Basquiat and his sisters were raised by their father. His mother was admitted to a psychiatric hospital when he was ten and thereafter spent her life in and out of institutions. By the age of eleven, Basquiat was fluent in French, Spanish and English, and an avid reader of all three languages.\\nBasquiat\\'s family resided in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Boerum Hill and then in 1974, moved to Miramar, Puerto Rico. When they returned to Brooklyn in 1976, Basquiat attended Edward R. Murrow High School. He struggled to deal with his mother\\'s instability and rebelled as a teenager. He ran away from home at 15 when his father caught him smoking cannabis in his room. He slept on park benches at Washington Square Park and took LSD. Eventually, his father spotted him with a shaved head and called the police to bring him home.\\nIn the 10th grade, he enrolled at City-As-School, an alternative high school in Manhattan, home to many artistic students who found conventional schooling difficult. He would skip school with his friends, but still received encouragement from his teachers, and began to write and illustrate for the school newspaper. He developed the character SAMO to endorse a faux religion. The saying \"SAMO\" had started as a private joke between Basquiat and his schoolmate Al Diaz, as an abbreviation for the phrase \"Same old shit.\" They drew a series of cartoons for their school paper before and after using SAMO©.\\n\\n\\n=== Street art and Gray: 1978–1980 ===\\n In May 1978, Basquiat and Diaz began spray painting graffiti on buildings in Lower Manhattan. Working under the pseudonym SAMO, they inscribed poetic and satirical advertising slogans such as \"SAMO© AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD.\" In June 1978, Basquiat was expelled from City-As-School for pieing the principal. At 17, his father kicked him out of the house when he decided to drop out of school. He worked for the Unique Clothing Warehouse in NoHo while continuing to create graffiti at night. On December 11, 1978, The Village Voice published an article about the SAMO graffiti.\\nIn 1979, Basquiat appeared on the live public-access television show TV Party hosted by Glenn O\\'Brien. Basquiat and O\\'Brien formed a friendship and he made regular appearances on the show over the next few years. Eventually, he began spending time writing graffiti around the School of Visual Arts, where he befriended students John Sex, Kenny Scharf, and Keith Haring.\\nIn April 1979, Basquiat met Michael Holman at the Canal Zone Party and they founded the noise rock band Test Pattern, which was later renamed Gray. Other members of Gray included Shannon Dawson, Nick Taylor, Wayne Clifford and Vincent Gallo. They performed at nightclubs such as Max\\'s Kansas City, CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club.\\nAround this time, Basquiat lived in the East Village with his friend Alexis Adler, a Barnard biology graduate. He often copied diagrams of chemical compounds borrowed from Adler\\'s science textbooks. She documented Basquiat\\'s creative explorations as he transformed the floors, walls, doors and furniture into his artworks. He also made postcards with his friend Jennifer Stein. While selling postcards in SoHo, Basquiat spotted Andy Warhol at W.P.A. restaurant with art critic Henry Geldzahler. He sold Warhol a postcard titled Stupid Games, Bad Ideas.\\n\\nIn October 1979, at Arleen Schloss\\'s open space called A\\'s, Basquiat showed his SAMO montages using color Xerox copies of his works. Schloss allowed Basquiat to use the space to create his \"MAN MADE\" clothing, which were painted upcycled garments. In November 1979, costume designer Patricia Field carried his clothing line in her upscale boutique on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. Field also displayed his sculptures in the store window.\\nWhen Basquiat and Diaz had a falling out, he inscribed \"SAMO IS DEAD\" on the walls of SoHo buildings in 1980. In June 1980, he appeared in High Times magazine, his first national publication, as part of an article titled \"Graffiti \\'80: The State of the Outlaw Art\" by Glenn O\\'Brien. Later that year, he began filming O\\'Brien\\'s independent film Downtown 81 (2000), originally titled New York Beat, which featured some of Gray\\'s recordings on its soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n=== Rise to fame and success: 1980–1986 ===\\nIn June 1980, Basquiat participated in The Times Square Show, a multi-artist exhibition sponsored by Collaborative Projects Incorporated (Colab) and Fashion Moda. He was noticed by various critics and curators, including Jeffrey Deitch, who mentioned him in an article titled \"Report from Times Square\" in the September 1980 issue of Art in America. In February 1981, Basquiat participated in the New York/New Wave exhibition, curated by Diego Cortez at New York\\'s P.S.1. Italian artist Sandro Chia recommended Basquiat\\'s work to Italian dealer Emilio Mazzoli, who promptly bought 10 paintings for Basquiat to have a show at his gallery in Modena, Italy in May 1981. In December 1981, art critic Rene Ricard published \"The Radiant Child\" in Artforum magazine, the first extensive article on Basquiat. During this period, Basquiat painted many pieces on objects he found in the streets, such as discarded doors.\\nBasquiat sold his first painting, Cadillac Moon (1981), to Debbie Harry, lead singer of the punk rock band Blondie, for $200 after they had filmed Downtown 81 together. He also appeared as a disc jockey in the 1981 Blondie music video \"Rapture\", a role originally intended for Grandmaster Flash. At the time, Basquiat was living with his girlfriend, Suzanne Mallouk, who financially supported him as a waitress.\\nIn September 1981, art dealer Annina Nosei invited Basquiat to join her gallery at the suggestion of Sandro Chia. Soon after, he participated in her group show Public Address. She provided him with materials and a space to work in the basement of her gallery. In 1982, Nosei arranged for him to move into a loft which also served as a studio at 101 Crosby Street in SoHo. He had his first American one-man show at the Annina Nosei Gallery in March 1982. He also painted in Modena for his second Italian exhibition in March 1982. Feeling exploited, that show was canceled because he was expected to make eight paintings in one week.\\n\\nBy the summer of 1982, Basquiat had left the Annina Nosei Gallery and gallerist Bruno Bischofberger became his worldwide art dealer. In June 1982, at 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in Documenta in Kassel, Germany. His works were exhibited alongside Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol. Bischofberger gave Basquiat a one-man show at his Zurich gallery in September 1982, and arranged for him to meet Warhol for lunch on October 4, 1982. Warhol recalled, \"I took a Polaroid and he went home and within two hours a painting was back, still wet, of him and me together.\" The painting, Dos Cabezas (1982), ignited a friendship between them. Basquiat was photographed by James Van Der Zee for an interview with Henry Geldzahler published in the January 1983 issue of Warhol\\'s Interview magazine.\\nIn November 1982, Basquiat\\'s solo exhibition opened at the Fun Gallery in the East Village. Among the works exhibited were A Panel of Experts (1982) and Equals Pi (1982). In early December 1982, Basquiat began working at the studio space art dealer Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California home. In Los Angeles, he frequented the Whisky a Go Go and Tail o\\' the Pup with his friend artist George Condo. There, he commenced a series of paintings for a March 1983 show, his second at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood. He was accompanied by his girlfriend, then-unknown singer Madonna. Gagosian recalled: \"Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and we were having a lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, \\'My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.\\' ... So I said, \\'Well, what\\'s she like?\\' And he said, \\'Her name is Madonna and she\\'s going to be huge.\\' I\\'ll never forget that he said that.\"\\n\\nBasquiat took considerable interest in the work that artist Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood. He visited him on several occasions and found inspiration in his accomplishments. While in Los Angeles, Basquiat painted Hollywood Africans (1983), which portrays him with graffiti artists Toxic and Rammellzee. He often painted portraits of other graffiti artists—and sometimes collaborators—in works such as Portrait of A-One A.K.A. King (1982), Toxic (1984), and ERO (1984). In 1983, he produced the hip-hop record \"Beat Bop\" featuring Rammellzee and rapper K-Rob. It was pressed in limited quantities on his Tartown Inc. imprint. He created the cover art for the single, making it highly desirable among both record and art collectors.\\nIn March 1983, at 22 years old, Basquiat became one of the youngest artists to participate in the Whitney Biennial exhibition of contemporary art. Paige Powell, an associate publisher for Interview magazine, organized a show of his work at her friend\\'s New York apartment in April 1983. Shortly after, he began a relationship with Powell, who was instrumental in fostering his friendship with Warhol. In August 1983, Basquiat moved into a loft owned by Warhol at 57 Great Jones Street in NoHo, which also served as a studio.\\nIn the summer of 1983, Basquiat invited Lee Jaffe, a former musician in Bob Marley\\'s band, to join him on a trip throughout Asia and Europe. On his return to New York, he was deeply affected by the death of Michael Stewart, an aspiring black artist in the downtown club scene who was killed by transit police in September 1983. He painted Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart) (1983) in response to the incident. He also participated in a Christmas benefit with various New York artists for the family of Michael Stewart in 1983.\\nHaving joined the Mary Boone\\'s SoHo gallery in 1983, Basquiat had his first show there in May 1984. A large number of photographs depict a collaboration between Warhol and Basquiat in 1984 and 1985. When they collaborated, Warhol would start with something very concrete or a recognizable image and then Basquiat defaced it in his animated style. They made an homage to the 1984 Summer Olympics with Olympics (1984). Other collaborations include Taxi, 45th/Broadway (1984–85) and Zenith (1985). Their joint exhibition, Paintings, at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, caused a rift in their friendship after it was panned by critics, and Basquiat was called Warhol\\'s \"mascot\".\\nBasquiat often painted in expensive Armani suits and would appear in public in the same paint-splattered clothes. He was a regular at the Area nightclub, where he sometimes worked the turntables as a DJ for fun. He also painted murals for the Palladium nightclub in New York City. His swift rise to fame was covered in the media. He appeared on the cover of the February 10, 1985, issue of The New York Times Magazine in a feature titled \"New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist\". His work appeared in GQ and Esquire, and he was interviewed for MTV\\'s \"Art Break\" segment. In 1985, he walked the runway for the Comme des Garçons Spring fashion show in New York.\\nIn the mid-1980s, Basquiat was earning $1.4 million a year and he was receiving lump sums of $40,000 from art dealers. Despite his success, his emotional instability continued to haunt him. \"The more money Basquiat made, the more paranoid and deeply involved with drugs he became,\" wrote journalist Michael Shnayerson. Basquiat\\'s cocaine use became so excessive that he blew a hole in his nasal septum. A friend claimed that Basquiat confessed he was on heroin in late 1980. Many of his peers speculated that his drug use was a means of coping with the demands of his newfound fame, the exploitative nature of the art industry, and the pressures of being a black man in the white-dominated art world.\\nFor what would be his last exhibition on the West Coast, Basquiat returned to Los Angeles for his show at the Gagosian Gallery in January 1986. In February 1986, Basquiat traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for an exhibition of his drawings at Fay Gold Gallery. That month, he participated in Limelight\\'s Art Against Apartheid benefit. In the summer, he had a solo exhibition at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg. He was also invited to walk the runway for Rei Kawakubo again, this time at the Comme des Garçons Homme Plus fashion show in Paris. In October 1986, Basquiat flew to Ivory Coast for an exhibition of his work organized by Bruno Bischofberger at the French Cultural Institute in Abidjan. He was accompanied by his girlfriend Jennifer Goode, who worked at his frequent hangout, Area nightclub. In November 1986, at 25 years old, Basquiat became the youngest artist given an exhibition at Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover, Germany.\\n\\n\\n=== Final years and death: 1986–1988 ===\\nDuring their relationship, Goode began snorting heroin with Basquiat since drugs were at her disposal. She said: \"He didn\\'t push it on me, but it was just there and I was so naïve.\" In late 1986, she successfully got herself and Basquiat into a methadone program in Manhattan, but he quit after three weeks. According to Goode, he did not start injecting heroin until after she ended their relationship. In the last 18 months of his life, Basquiat became something of a recluse. His continued drug use is thought to have been a way of coping after the death of his friend Andy Warhol in February 1987.\\nIn 1987, Basquiat had exhibitions at Galerie Daniel Templon in Paris, the Akira Ikeda Gallery in Tokyo, and the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York. He designed a Ferris wheel for André Heller\\'s Luna Luna, an ephemeral amusement park in Hamburg from June to August 1987 with rides designed by renowned contemporary artists.\\nIn January 1988, Basquiat traveled to Paris for his exhibition at the Yvon Lambert Gallery and to Düsseldorf for an exhibition at the Hans Mayer Gallery. While in Paris, he befriended Ivorian artist Ouattara Watts. They made plans to travel together to Watts\\' birthplace, Korhogo, that summer. Following his exhibition at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery in New York in April 1988, Basquiat traveled to Maui in June to withdraw from drug use. After returning to New York in July, Basquiat ran into Keith Haring on Broadway, who stated that this last encounter was the only time Basquiat ever discussed his drug problem with him. Glenn O\\'Brien also recalled Basquiat calling him and telling him he was \"feeling really good.\"\\nDespite attempts at sobriety, Basquiat died at the age of 27 of a heroin overdose at his home on Great Jones Street in Manhattan on August 12, 1988. He had been found unresponsive in his bedroom by his girlfriend Kelle Inman and was taken to Cabrini Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\\n\\nBasquiat is buried at Brooklyn\\'s Green-Wood Cemetery. A private funeral was held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on August 17, 1988. The funeral was attended by immediate family and close friends, including Keith Haring, Francesco Clemente, Glenn O\\'Brien, and Basquiat\\'s former girlfriend Paige Powell. Art dealer Jeffrey Deitch delivered a eulogy.\\nA public memorial was held at Saint Peter\\'s Church on November 3, 1988. Among the speakers was Ingrid Sischy, who as the editor of Artforum got to know Basquiat well and commissioned a number of articles that introduced his work to the wider world. Basquiat\\'s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk recited sections of A. R. Penck\\'s \"Poem for Basquiat\" and his friend Fab 5 Freddy read a poem by Langston Hughes. The 300 guests included musicians John Lurie and Arto Lindsay, Keith Haring, poet David Shapiro, Glenn O\\'Brien, and members of Basquiat\\'s former band Gray.\\nIn memory of the late artist, Keith Haring created the painting A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat. In the obituary Haring wrote for Vogue, he stated: \"He truly created a lifetime of works in ten years. Greedily, we wonder what else he might have created, what masterpieces we have been cheated out of by his death, but the fact is that he has created enough work to intrigue generations to come. Only now will people begin to understand the magnitude of his contribution.\"\\n\\n\\n== Artistry ==\\nArt critic Franklin Sirmans analyzed that Basquiat appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. His social commentary were acutely political and direct in their criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle. He also explored artistic legacies from wide sources, including an interrogation of the classical tradition. Art historian Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that the underlying of Basquiat\\'s self-identification as an artist was his \"innate capacity to function as something like an oracle, distilling his perceptions of the outside world down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative act\", and that his art focused on recurrent \"suggestive dichotomies\" such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience.\\nBefore his career as a painter began, Basquiat produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for his political–poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. He often drew on random objects and surfaces, including other people\\'s clothing. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of his art. His paintings are typically covered with codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, and diagrams.\\nBasquiat primarily used texts as reference sources. A few of the books he used were Gray\\'s Anatomy, Henry Dreyfuss\\' Symbol Sourcebook, Leonardo da Vinci published by Reynal & Company, and Burchard Brentjes\\' African Rock Art, Flash of the Spirit by Robert Farris Thompson.\\nA middle period from late 1982 to 1985 featured multi-panel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars, the surface dense with writing, collage and imagery. The years 1984 to 1985 were also the period of the Basquiat–Warhol collaborations.\\n\\n\\n=== Drawings ===\\n\\nIn his short but prolific career, Basquiat produced around 1,500 drawings, around 600 paintings, and many sculpture and mixed media works. He drew constantly and often used objects around him as surfaces when paper was not immediately at hand. Since childhood, he produced cartoon-inspired drawings when encouraged by his mother\\'s interest in art, and drawing became a part of his expression as an artist. He drew in many different media, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick. He sometimes used Xerox copies of fragments of his drawings to paste onto the canvases of larger paintings.\\nThe first public showing of Basquiat\\'s paintings and drawings was in 1981 at the MoMA PS1 New York/New Wave exhibition. Rene Ricard\\'s article \"Radiant Child\" in Artforum magazine brought Basquiat to the attention of the art world. Basquiat immortalized Ricard in two drawings, Untitled (Axe/Rene) (1984) and René Ricard (1984).\\nA poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York, black historical figures, famous musicians and athletes, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate. Often Basquiat\\'s drawings were untitled, and as such to differentiate works a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after Untitled. After Basquiat died, his estate was controlled by his father Gérard Basquiat, who also oversaw the committee which authenticated artworks, and operated from 1994 to 2012 to review over 2000 works, the majority of which were drawings.\\n\\n\\n=== Heroes and saints ===\\nA prominent theme in Basquiat\\'s work is the portrayal of historically prominent black figures, who were identified as heroes and saints. His early works often featured the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in his specially chosen pantheon. \"Jean-Michel\\'s crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician, the great boxing champion. Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong, without prejudice as to their taste or age,\" said his friend and artist Francesco Clemente. Reviewing Basquiat\\'s show at the Bilbao Guggenheim, Art Daily noted that \"Basquiat\\'s crown is a changeable symbol: at times a halo and at others a crown of thorns, emphasizing the martyrdom that often goes hand in hand with sainthood. For Basquiat, these heroes and saints are warriors, occasionally rendered triumphant with arms raised in victory.\"\\nBasquiat was particularly a fan of bebop and cited saxophonist Charlie Parker as a hero. He frequently referenced Parker and other jazz musicians in paintings such as Charles the First (1982) and Horn Players (1983), and King Zulu (1986). \"Basquiat looked to jazz music for inspiration and for instruction, much in the same way that he looked to the modern masters of painting,\" said art historian Jordana Moore Saggese.\\n\\n\\n=== Anatomy and heads ===\\nA major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book Gray\\'s Anatomy, which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital when he was seven. It remained influential in his depictions of human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text as seen in Flesh and Spirit (1982–83). Art historian Olivier Berggruen situates in Basquiat\\'s anatomical screen prints Anatomy (1982) an assertion of vulnerability, one which \"creates an aesthetic of the body as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, it is the very act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity.\"\\nHeads and skulls are significant focal points of many of Basquiat\\'s most seminal works. Heads in works like Untitled (Two Heads on Gold) (1982) and Philistines (1982) are reminiscent of African masks, suggesting a cultural reclamation. The skulls allude to Haitian Vodou, which is filled with skull symbolism; the paintings Red Skull (1982) and Untitled (1982) can be seen as primary examples. In reference to the potent image depicted in Untitled (Skull) (1981), art historian Fred Hoffman writes that Basquiat was likely \"caught off guard, possibly even frightened, by the power and energy emanating from this unexpected image.\" Further investigation by Hoffman in his book The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat reveals a deeper interest in the artist\\'s fascination with heads that proves an evolution in the artist\\'s oeuvre from one of raw power to one of more refined cognizance.\\n\\n\\n=== Heritage ===\\nBasquiat\\'s diverse cultural heritage was one of his many sources of inspiration. He often incorporated Spanish words into his artworks like Untitled (Pollo Frito) (1982) and Sabado por la Noche (1984). Basquiat\\'s La Hara (1981), a menacing portrait of a white police officer, combines the Nuyorican slang term for police (la jara) and the Irish surname O\\'Hara. The black-hatted figure that appears in his paintings The Guilt of Gold Teeth (1982) and Despues De Un Pun (1987) is believed to represent Baron Samedi, the spirit of death and resurrection in Haitian Vodou.\\nBasquiat has various works deriving from African-American history, namely Slave Auction (1982), Undiscovered Genius of the Mississippi Delta (1983), El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile) (1983), and Jim Crow (1986). Another painting, Irony of Negro Policeman (1981), illustrates how African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly white society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the \"institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power\" years after the Jim Crow era had ended. This concept has been reiterated in additional Basquiat works, including Created Equal (1984).\\nIn the essay \"Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the (Re)Mix,\" Kellie Jones posits that Basquiat\\'s \"mischievous, complex, and neologistic side, with regard to the fashioning of modernity and the influence and effluence of black culture\" are often elided by critics and viewers, and thus \"lost in translation.\"\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nShortly after his death, The New York Times indicated that Basquiat was \"the most famous of only a small number of young black artists who have achieved national recognition.\" Art critic Bonnie Rosenberg wrote that Basquiat experienced a good taste of fame in his last years when he was a \"critically embraced and popularly celebrated artistic phenomenon\"; and that some people focused on the \"superficial exoticism of his work,\" missing the fact that it \"held important connections to expressive precursors.\"\\nTraditionally, the interpretation of Basquiat\\'s works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, the figures in his paintings, as stated by writer Stephen Metcalf, \"are shown frontally, with little or no depth of field, and nerves and organs are exposed, as in an anatomy textbook. Are these creatures dead and being clinically dissected, one wonders, or alive and in immense pain?\" Writer Olivia Laing noted that \"words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning.\"\\nA second recurrent reference to Basquiat\\'s aesthetics comes from the artist\\'s intention to share, in the words of gallerist Niru Ratnam, a \"highly individualistic, expressive view of the world\". Art historian Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo believes Basquiat\\'s work inspires people to \"paint like a child, don\\'t paint what is in the surface but what you are re-creating inside. Musician David Bowie, who was a collector of Basquiat\\'s works, stated that \"he seemed to digest the frenetic flow of passing image and experience, put them through some kind of internal reorganization and dress the canvas with this resultant network of chance.\"\\nArt critics have also compared Basquiat\\'s work to the emergence of hip-hop during the same era. \"Basquiat\\'s art—like the best hip-hop—takes apart and reassembles the work that came before it,\" said art critic Franklin Sirmans in a 2005 essay, \"In the Cipher: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Culture\".\\n\\nArt critic Rene Ricard wrote in his 1981 article \"The Radiant Child\":I\\'m always amazed at how people come up with things. Like Jean-Michel. How did he come up with the words he puts all over everything, his way of making a point without overstating the case, using one or two words he reveals a political acuity, gets the viewer going in the direction he wants, the illusion of the bombed-over wall. One or two words containing a full body. One or two words on a Jean-Michel contain the entire history of graffiti. What he incorporates into his pictures, whether found or made, is specific and selective. He has a perfect idea of what he\\'s getting across, using everything that collates to his vision.Curator Marc Mayer wrote in the 2005 essay \"Basquiat in History\":Basquiat speaks articulately while dodging the full impact of clarity like a matador. We can read his pictures without strenuous effort—the words, the images, the colors and the construction—but we cannot quite fathom the point they belabor. Keeping us in this state of half-knowing, of mystery-within-familiarity, had been the core technique of his brand of communication since his adolescent days as the graffiti poet SAMO. To enjoy them, we are not meant to analyze the pictures too carefully. Quantifying the encyclopedic breadth of his research certainly results in an interesting inventory, but the sum cannot adequately explain his pictures, which requires an effort outside the purview of iconography ... he painted a calculated incoherence, calibrating the mystery of what such apparently meaning-laden pictures might ultimately mean.\\nIn the 1980s, art critic Robert Hughes dismissed Basquiat\\'s work as absurd. He attributed the Basquiat phenomenon to be a mixture of hype, overproduction, and a greedy art market.\\nIn a 1997 review for The Daily Telegraph, art critic Hilton Kramer begins by stating that Basquiat had no idea what the word \"quality\" meant. He relentlessly criticized Basquiat as a \"talentless hustler\" and \"street-smart but otherwise invincibly ignorant\", arguing that he \"used his youth, his looks, his skin colour and his abundant sex appeal to win an overnight fame that proved to be his undoing\" and that art dealers of the time were \"as ignorant about art as Basquiat himself.\" In saying that Basquiat\\'s work never rose above \"that lowly artistic station\" of graffiti \"even when his paintings were fetching enormous prices,\" Kramer argued that graffiti art \"acquired a cult status in certain New York art circles.\" He further opined, \"As a result of the campaign waged by these art-world entrepreneurs on Basquiat\\'s behalf—and their own, of course—there was never any doubt that the museums, the collectors and the media would fall into line\" when talking about the marketing of Basquiat\\'s name.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nBasquiat\\'s first public exhibition was at The Times Square Show in New York in June 1980. In May 1981, he had his first solo exhibition at Galleria d\\'Arte Emilio Mazzoli in Modena. In late 1981, he joined the Annina Nosei Gallery in New York, where he had his first American one-man show from March 6 to April 1, 1982. In 1982, he also had shows at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood, Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Zurich, and the Fun Gallery in the East Village. Major exhibitions of his work have included Jean-Michel Basquiat: Paintings 1981–1984 at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh in 1984, which traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1985. In 1985, the University Art Museum, Berkeley hosted Basquiat\\'s first solo American museum exhibition. His work was showcased at Kestner-Gesellschaft, Hannover in 1987 and 1989.\\nThe first retrospective of his work was held by the Baghoomian Gallery in New York from October to November 1989. His first museum retrospective, Jean-Michel Basquiat, was at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York from October 1992 to February 1993. The show was sponsored by AT&T, MTV and Basquiat\\'s former girlfriend Madonna. It subsequently traveled to the Menil Collection in Texas; the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa; and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Alabama, from 1993 to 1994. The exhibition\\'s catalog was edited by Richard Marshall and included several essays from different perspectives. In 1996, Madonna sponsored an exhibition of his work at the Serpentine Gallery in London.\\nIn March 2005, the retrospective Basquiat was mounted by the Brooklyn Museum in New York. It traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. From October 2006 to January 2007, the first Basquiat exhibition in Puerto Rico was held at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, produced by ArtPremium, Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici. In 2016, the Brooklyn Museum organized and presented Basquiat: The Unknown Notebooks, the first major viewing of Basquiat\\'s sketches, poetry, notetaking, and overall artist\\'s book practice. The show traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami later on. A monograph featuring essays by Pérez Art Museum Miami executive director, the art historian Franklin Sirmans and Henry Louis Gates, was published in the occasion of this exhibition\\nBasquiat remains an important source of inspiration for a younger generation of contemporary artists all over the world, such as Rita Ackermann and Kader Attia—as shown, for example, at the exhibition Street and Studio: From Basquiat to Séripop co-curated by Cathérine Hug and Thomas Mießgang and previously exhibited at Kunsthalle Wien, Austria, in 2010. Basquiat and the Bayou, a 2014 show presented by the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans, focused on the artist\\'s works with themes of the American South. The Brooklyn Museum exhibited Basquiat: The Unknown Notebooks in 2015. In 2017, Basquiat Before Basquiat: East 12th Street, 1979–1980 exhibited as Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, which displayed works created during the year Basquiat lived with his friend Alexis Adler. Later that year, the Barbican Centre in London exhibited Basquiat: Boom for Real.\\nIn 2019, the Brant Foundation in New York, hosted an extensive exhibition of Basquiat\\'s works with free admission. All 50,000 tickets were claimed before the exhibition opened, so additional tickets were released. In June 2019, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York presented Basquiat\\'s \"Defacement\": The Untold Story. Later that year, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne opened the exhibition Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines. In 2020, the Lotte Museum of Art mounted the first major exhibition of Jean-Michel Basquiat in Seoul. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston exhibited Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation from October 2020 to July 2021.\\nBasquiat\\'s family curated Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure, an immersive exhibition with over 200 never-before-seen and rarely shown works. King Pleasure debuted at the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea, New York in April 2022. In March 2023, the exhibition traveled to the Grand LA in Los Angeles. \\nIn 2022, the Albertina presented the first museum retrospective of Basquiat\\'s work in Austria. The exhibition Seeing Loud: Basquiat and Music was mounted at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 2022. In 2023, the show traveled to Paris as Basquiat Soundtracks at the Philharmonie de Paris. Later that year, the Brant Foundation held the exhibition Basquiat X Warhol at their East Village location.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nBasquiat sold his first painting to singer Debbie Harry for $200 in 1981. Advised by Italian artist Sandro Chia, gallerist Emilio Mazzoli purchased ten of Basquiat\\'s works for $10,000 and held an exhibition at his gallery in Modena in May 1981. Spurred by the Neo-expressionism art boom, his work was in great demand by 1982, which is considered his most valuable year. A majority of his highest-selling paintings at auction date to 1982. Recalling that year, Basquiat said, \"I had some money; I made the best paintings ever.\" His paintings were priced at $5,000 to $10,000 in 1983—lowered from the range of $10,000 to $15,000 when he joined Mary Boone\\'s gallery to reflect what she felt was consistent with those of other artists in her gallery. In 1984, it was reported that in two years his work appreciated in value by 500%. In the mid-1980s, Basquiat was earning $1.4 million a year as an artist. By 1985, his paintings were selling for $10,000 to $25,000 each. Basquiat\\'s rise to fame in the international art market landed him on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in 1985, which was unprecedented for a young African-American artist.\\nSince Basquiat\\'s death in 1988, the market for his work has developed steadily—in line with overall art market trends—with a dramatic peak in 2007 when, at the height of the art market boom, the global auction volume for his work was over $115 million. Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie\\'s, is quoted describing Basquiat\\'s market as \"two-tiered ... The most coveted material is rare, generally dating from the best period, 1981–83.\" Until 2002, the highest amount paid for an original work of Basquiat\\'s was $3.3 million for Self-Portrait (1982), sold at Christie\\'s in 1998. In 2002, Basquiat\\'s Profit I (1982) was sold at Christie\\'s by drummer Lars Ulrich of the heavy metal band Metallica for $5.5 million. The proceedings of the auction were documented in the 2004 film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster.\\nIn June 2002, New York artist Alfredo Martinez was charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with attempting to deceive two art dealers by selling them $185,000 worth of fake Basquiat drawings. The charges against Martinez, which landed him in Manhattan\\'s Metropolitan Correction Center for 21 months, involved a scheme to sell drawings he copied from authentic artworks, accompanied by forged certificates of authenticity. Martinez claimed he got away with selling fake Basquiat drawings for 18 years.\\nIn 2007, Basquiat\\'s painting Hannibal (1982) was seized by federal authorities as part of an embezzlement scheme by convicted Brazilian money launderer and former banker Edemar Cid Ferreira. Ferreira had purchased the painting with illegally acquired funds while he controlled Banco Santos in Brazil. It was shipped to a Manhattan warehouse, via the Netherlands, with a false shipping invoice stating it was worth $100. The painting was later sold at Sotheby\\'s for $13.1 million.\\nBetween 2007 and 2012, the price of Basquiat\\'s work continued to steadily increase up to $16.3 million. The sale of Untitled (1981) for $20.1 million in 2012 elevated his market to a new stratosphere. Soon other works in his oeuvre outpaced that record. Another work, Untitled (1981), depicting a fisherman, sold for $26.4 million in 2012. In 2013, Dustheads (1982) sold for $48.8 million at Christie\\'s. Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa purchased Untitled (1982), depicting a devil-like figure, for $57.3 million at Christie\\'s in 2017. He sold the painting for $85 million at Phillips in 2022. Maezawa also purchased Basquiat\\'s Untitled (1982), a powerful depiction of a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, for a record-setting $110.5 million in May 2017. It is the second highest price ever paid at an auction for artwork by an American artist.\\nIn 2018, Flexible (1984) sold for $45.3 million, becoming Basquiat\\'s first post-1983 painting to surpass the $20 million mark. In June 2020, Untitled (Head) (1982), sold for $15.2 million; a record for a Sotheby\\'s online sale and a record for a Basquiat work on paper. In July 2020, Loïc Gouzer\\'s Fair Warning app announced that an untitled drawing on paper sold for $10.8 million, which is a record high for an in-app purchase. Earlier that year, American businessman Ken Griffin purchased Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump (1982) for upwards of $100 million from art collector Peter Brant. In March 2021, Warrior (1982) sold for $41.8 million at Christie\\'s in Hong Kong, which is the most expensive Western work of art sold at auction in Asia. In May 2021, In This Case (1983) sold for $93.1 million at Christie\\'s in New York. Later that year, Donut Revenge (1982) sold for $20.9 million at Christie\\'s in Hong Kong. In 2022, Sugar Ray Robinson (1982) sold for $32.6 million at Christie\\'s in New York. In 2023, El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile) (1983) sold for $67.1 million at Christie\\'s, and Self-Portrait as a Heel (Part Two) (1982) sold for $42 million at Sotheby\\'s in New York.\\n\\n\\n=== Forgeries ===\\nIn 1994, three paintings displayed as Basquiats at the FIAC were revealed to be fakes. In 2007 Christie\\'s was sued in Manhattan Supreme Court for allegedly selling a fake Basquiat. Christie\\'s rejected the charge but the suit proceeded. In 2020 a Los Angeles man, Philip Bennet Righter, plead guilty to  art fraud after trying to sell forged paintings by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Also in 2020, in France, an exhibition of drawings attributed to Basquiat at the Volcano gallery in Nuits-Saint-Georges was disputed.  \\nIn February 2022, the Orlando Museum of Art mounted the controversial exhibition Heroes & Monsters, which consisted of 25 cardboard works that were claimed to have been sold by Basquiat directly to screenwriter Thad Mumford in 1982, and then placed in storage, where they remained until being rediscovered in 2012. The paintings were seized in a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in June 2022. The New York Times obtained an affidavit that revealed Mumford signed a declaration in the presence of federal agents stating that \"at no time in the 1980s or any other time did I meet with Jean-Michel Basquiat, and at no time did I acquire or purchase any paintings from him.\" Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman confessed to creating a suite of 25 Basquiat forgeries that wound up at the Orlando Museum of Art and was sentenced to community service and probation.\\nIn 2023, Florida art dealer Daniel Elie Bouaziz was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for a money laundering scheme to sell counterfeit contemporary artworks, including pieces purportedly by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Banksy. \\n\\n\\n=== Authentication committee ===\\nThe authentication committee of the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat was formed by the Robert Miller Gallery, the gallery that was assigned to handle Basquiat\\'s estate after his death, in part to wage battle against the growing number of fakes and forgeries in the Basquiat market. The cost of the committee\\'s opinion was $100. The committee was headed by Basquiat\\'s father Gérard Basquiat. Members varied depending on who was available at the time when a piece was being authenticated, but they have included the curators and gallerists Diego Cortez, Jeffrey Deitch, Annina Nosei, John Cheim, Richard Marshall, Fred Hoffman, and publisher Larry Warsh.\\nIn 2008, the authentication committee was sued by collector Gerard De Geer, who claimed the committee breached its contract by refusing to offer an opinion on the authenticity of the painting Fuego Flores (1983). After the lawsuit was dismissed, the committee ruled the work genuine. In January 2012, the committee announced that after eighteen years it would dissolve in September of that year and no longer consider applications.\\n\\n\\n== Sexuality ==\\nBasquiat had romantic relationships with many women, including singer Madonna. Although he never publicly identified as bisexual, a few of his friends have stated that he had sexual relationships with men. Basquiat\\'s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk described his sexual interest as \"not monochromatic. It did not rely on visual stimulation, such as a pretty girl. It was a very rich multichromatic sexuality. He was attracted to people for all different reasons. They could be boys, girls, thin, fat, pretty, ugly ... He was attracted to intelligence more than anything and to pain.\"\\nBiographer Phoebe Hoban wrote on Basquiat\\'s first sexual experiences, which were with men. When Basquiat was a minor in Puerto Rico he was orally raped by a barber dressed in drag, then he got involved with a deejay. Art critic Rene Ricard, who helped launch Basquiat\\'s career, said that Basquiat was into everything and had \"turned tricks\" in Condado when he lived in Puerto Rico. As a teenager, Basquiat told a friend that he worked as a prostitute on 42nd Street in Manhattan when he ran away from home. Andy Warhol said Basquiat had refused to go with him and Keith Haring to Rounds, a gay hustler bar, because it brought back bad memories of when he was hustling.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\nBasquiat\\'s estate was administered by his father, Gerard Basquiat, until his passing in 2013. It is now run by his sisters, Jeanine Heriveaux and Lisane Basquiat. His work had a significant impact on the street art and hip hop scene, and has been noted as an influence on a range of contemporary artists including Banksy, Shepard Fairey, and Halim Flowers.\\nIn 2015, Basquiat was featured on the cover of Vanity Fair\\'s Art and Artists Special Edition. In 2016, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation placed a plaque commemorating Basquiat\\'s life outside his former residence at 57 Great Jones Street in Manhattan. In 2017, Basquiat was posthumously awarded the key to the city of Brooklyn by Borough President Eric Adams and honored on the Celebrity Path at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\\nBefore the exhibition Basquiat: Boom for Real at London\\'s Barbican Centre in 2017, graffiti artist Banksy created two murals inspired by Basquiat on the walls of the Barbican. The first mural depicts Basquiat\\'s painting Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump (1982) being searched by two police officers. The second mural depicts a carousel with the carriages replaced with Basquiat\\'s signature crown motif.\\nIn 2018, a public square in the 13th arrondissement of Paris was named Place Jean-Michel Basquiat in his memory. For the 2020–21 NBA season, the Brooklyn Nets honored Basquiat with their City Edition uniform and a court design inspired by his art. In 2021, the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation funded a Basquiat educational arts program developed in partnership between the Brooklyn Nets, the New York City Department of Education and the Fund for Public Schools. The Nets used a white version of the Basquiat City Edition uniform for the 2022–23 NBA season.\\n\\n\\n=== Fashion ===\\nIn 2007, Basquiat was listed among GQ\\'s 50 Most Stylish Men of the Past 50 Years. Basquiat often painted in expensive Armani suits and he did a photo shoot for Issey Miyake. Comme des Garçons was one of his favorite brands; he was a model for the Spring 1986 fashion show in New York and the Homme Plus Spring/Summer 1987 fashion show in Paris. To commemorate Basquiat\\'s runway appearances, Comme des Garçons featured his prints in the brand\\'s Fall/Winter 2018 collection. In 2015, Basquiat was featured on the cover of T: The New York Times Style Magazine Men\\'s Style issue.\\nValentino\\'s Fall/Winter 2006 collection paid homage to Basquiat. Sean John created a capsule collection for the 30th anniversary of Basquiat\\'s death in 2018. Apparel and accessories companies that have featured Basquiat\\'s work include Uniqlo, Urban Outfitters, Supreme, Herschel Supply Co., Alice + Olivia, Olympia Le-Tan, DAEM, Coach New York, and Saint Laurent. Footwear companies such as Dr. Martens, Reebok, and Vivobarefoot have also collaborated with Basquiat\\'s estate.\\nIn 2021, luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co. partnered with American singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z to promote the company\\'s \"About Love\" campaign. The campaign incorporated Tiffany\\'s recently acquired painting, Equals Pi (1982), by Basquiat. The painting heavily features a color close to the company\\'s signature robin egg blue.The campaign was met with criticism from the artist\\'s friends and colleagues.  \\nIn 2022, Basquiat\\'s estate partnered with Black Fashion Fair for a limited-run capsule collection, which was on view at the exhibition Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure in New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Film, television and theater ===\\nBasquiat starred in Downtown 81, a vérité movie written by Glenn O\\'Brien and shot by Edo Bertoglio in 1980–81, but not released until 2000. \\nWithout Walls: Shooting Star, a British documentary by Geoff Dunlop on Basquiat\\'s life, aired on Channel 4 in 1990. In 1996, painter Julian Schnabel made his filmmaking debut with the biopic Basquiat. It stars Jeffrey Wright as Basquiat and David Bowie as Andy Warhol.\\nJean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, a documentary film directed by Tamra Davis, premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and was shown on the PBS series Independent Lens in 2011. Sara Driver directed the documentary film Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat, which premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2018, PBS aired the documentary Basquiat: Rage to Riches as part of the American Masters series.\\nIn 2022, it was reported that actor Kelvin Harrison Jr. will star as Basquiat in an upcoming biopic titled Samo Lives, which will be written, directed and produced by Julius Onah. It was also announced that actor Stephan James will star and co-produce a limited series about Basquiat.\\nIn 2022, The Collaboration, a play by Anthony McCarten about Basquiat and Warhol debuted at London\\'s Young Vic Theatre with Jeremy Pope portraying Basquiat, and Paul Bettany as Warhol. The play then moved to Broadway, for a limited run from December 2022 through March 2023, again starring Bettany and Pope, produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. The pair have also reprised their roles in a film version.\\n\\n\\n=== Literature ===\\n\\nIn 1991, poet Kevin Young published the book To Repel Ghosts, a compendium of 117 poems relating to Basquiat\\'s life, individual paintings, and social themes found in the artist\\'s work. He published a \"remix\" of the book in 2005. In 1993, a children\\'s book was released titled Life Doesn\\'t Frighten Me, which combines a poem written by Maya Angelou with art made by Basquiat.\\nIn 1998, journalist Phoebe Hoban published the unauthorized biography Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art. In 2000, author Jennifer Clement wrote the memoir Widow Basquiat: A Love Story, based on the narratives told to her by Basquiat\\'s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk.\\nIn 2005, poet M. K. Asante published the poem \"SAMO\", dedicated to Basquiat, in his book Beautiful. And Ugly Too. The children\\'s book Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, written and illustrated by Javaka Steptoe, was released in 2016. The picture book won the Caldecott Medal in 2017. In 2019, illustrator Paolo Parisi wrote the graphic novel Basquiat: A Graphic Novel, following Basquiat\\'s journey from street-art legend SAMO to international art-scene darling, up until his death.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nShortly after Basquiat\\'s death, guitarist Vernon Reid of the funk metal band Living Colour wrote a song called \"Desperate People\", released on their album Vivid. The song primarily addresses the drug scene of New York at that time. Reid was inspired to write the song after receiving a phone call from Greg Tate informing him of Basquiat\\'s death.\\nIn August 2014, Revelation 13:18 released the single \"Old School\" featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat, along with the self-titled album Revelation 13:18 x Basquiat. The release date of \"Old School\" coincided with the anniversary of Basquiat\\'s death. In 2020, New York rock band the Strokes used Basquiat\\'s painting Bird on Money (1981) as the cover art for their album The New Abnormal.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of paintings by Jean-Michel Basquiat\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nAlmiron, J.

       "  'Thomas K. Wesselmann (February 23, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American artist associated with the Pop Art movement who worked in painting, collage and sculpture.\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\nWesselmann was born in Cincinnati.\\nFrom 1949 to 1951 he attended college in Ohio; first at Hiram College, and then transferred to major in Psychology at the University of Cincinnati. He was drafted into the US Army in 1952, but spent his service years stateside. During that time he made his first cartoons, and became interested in pursuing a career in cartooning. After his discharge he completed his psychology degree in 1954, whereupon he began to study drawing at the Art Academy of Cincinnati.  He achieved some initial success when he sold his first cartoon strips to the magazines 1000 Jokes and True.\\nCooper Union accepted him in 1956, and he continued his studies in New York. During a visit to the MoMA he was inspired by the Robert Motherwell painting Elegy to the Spanish Republic: “The first aesthetic experience… He felt a sensation of high visceral excitement in his stomach, and it seemed as though his eyes and stomach were directly connected”.\\nWesselmann also admired the work of Willem de Kooning, but he soon rejected action painting: “He realized he had to find his own passion he felt he had to deny to himself all that he loved in de Kooning, and go in as opposite a direction as possible.\"\\nFor Wesselmann, 1958 was a pivotal year. A landscape painting trip to Cooper Union\\'s Green Camp in rural New Jersey, brought him to the realization that he could pursue painting, rather than cartooning, as a career.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1959–1964 ===\\nAfter graduation, Wesselmann became one of the founding members of the Judson Gallery, along with Marc Ratliff and Jim Dine, also from Cincinnati, who had just arrived in New York.  He and Ratliff showed a number of small collages in a two-man exhibition at Judson Gallery. He began to teach art at a public school in Brooklyn, and later at the High School of Art and Design.\\nWesselmann\\'s series Great American Nude (begun 1961) first brought him to the attention of the art world. After a dream concerning the phrase \"red, white, and blue\", he decided to paint a Great American Nude in a palette limited to those colors and any colors associated with patriotic motifs such as gold and khaki.  The series incorporated representational images with an accordingly patriotic theme, such as American landscape photos and portraits of founding fathers. Often these images were collaged from magazines and discarded posters, which called for a larger format than Wesselmann had used previously. As works began to approach a giant scale he approached advertisers directly to acquire billboards.\\nThrough Henry Geldzahler, Wesselmann met Alex Katz, who offered him a show at the Tanager Gallery. Wesselmann\\'s first solo show was held there later that year, representing both the large and small Great American Nude collages.  In 1962, Richard Bellamy offered him a one-man exhibition at the Green Gallery. About the same time, Ivan Karp of the Leo Castelli Gallery put Wesselmann in touch with several collectors and talked to him about Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist’s works. These Wesselmann viewed without noting any similarities with his own {S. Stealingworth, p. 25}.\\nWhile not a cohesive movement, the idea of Pop Art (a name coined by Lawrence Alloway and others) was gradually spreading among international art critics and the public. In  As Henry Geldzahler observed: \"About a year and a half ago I saw the works of Wesselmann..., Warhol, Rosenquist and Lichtenstein in their studios (it was more or less July 1961). They were working independently, unaware of each other, but drawing on a common source of imagination. In the space of a year and a half they put on exhibitions, created a movement and we are now here discussing the matter in a conference. This is instant history of art, a history of art that became so aware of itself as to make a leap that went beyond art itself\".\\nThe Sidney Janis Gallery held the New Realists exhibition in November 1962, which included works by the American artists Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, George Segal, and Andy Warhol; and Europeans such as Arman, Enrico Baj, Christo, Yves Klein, Tano Festa, Mimmo Rotella, Jean Tinguely, and Mario Schifano. It followed the Nouveau Réalisme exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in Paris, and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called Pop Art in Britain and The United States and Nouveau Réalisme on the European continent.\\nWesselmann took part in the New Realist show with some reservations, exhibiting two 1962 works: Still life #17 and Still life #22.\\nWesselmann never liked his inclusion in American Pop Art, pointing out how he made an aesthetic use of everyday objects and not a criticism of them as consumer objects: “I dislike labels in general and \\'Pop\\' in particular, especially because it overemphasizes the material used. There does seem to be a tendency to use similar materials and images, but the different ways they are used denies any kind of group intention”.\\nThat year, Wesselmann had begun working on a new series of still lifes. experimenting with assemblage as well as collage. In Still Life #28 he included a television set that was turned on, \"interested in the competitive demands that a TV, with moving images and giving off light and sound, can make on painted portions\". He concentrated on the juxtapositions of different elements and depictions, which were at the time truly exciting for him: \"Not just the differences between what they were, but the aura each had with it ... A painted pack of cigarettes next to a painted apple wasn’t enough for me. They are both the same kind of thing. But if one is from a cigarette ad and the other a painted apple, they are two different realities and they trade on each other ... This kind of relationship helps establish a momentum throughout the picture ... At first glance, my pictures seem well behaved, as if – that is a still life, O.K.  But these things have such crazy give-and-take that I feel they get really very wild\". He married Claire Selley in November 1963.\\nIn 1964 Ben Birillo, an artist and business partner of gallery owner Paul Bianchini, contacted Wesselmann and other Pop artists with the goal of organizing The American Supermarket at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. This was an installation of a large supermarket where Pop works (Warhol\\'s Campbell\\'s Soup, Watts\\'s colored wax eggs etc.) were shown among real food and neon signs. In the same year Wesselmann began working on landscapes, including one that includes the noise of a Volkswagen starting up. The first shaped canvas nudes also appeared this year.\\n\\n\\n=== 1965–1970 ===\\nWesselmann\\'s works in these years: Great American Nude #53, Great American Nude #57, show an accentuated, more explicit sensuality, as though celebrating the rediscovered sexual fulfilment of his new relationship. He carried on working on his landscapes, but also made the Great American Nude #82, reworking the nude in a third dimension not defined by drawn lines but by medium: molded Plexiglas modeled on the female figure, then painted.  His compositional focus also became more daring, narrowing down to isolate a single detail: the Mouth series began in 1965, his Seascapes began the following year. Two  other new subjects also appeared: Bedroom Painting and Smoker Study,  the latter of which developed from observation of his model for the Mouth series. The Smoker Study series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s.\\nBeginning in 1965, Wesselmann made several studies for seascapes in oil while vacationing on Cape Cod and in upstate New York. In his New York City studio, he used an old projector to enlarge them into large-format works. These views, called the Drop-Out series were constructed from the negative space around a breast. The breast and torso frame one side of the image while the arm and the leg form the other two sides. This series of works would become one of the most recurrent themes in the 1970s. He started working on shaped canvases and opted for increasingly large formats.\\nHe worked constantly on the Bedroom Painting series, in which elements of the Great American Nude, Still Lifes and Seascapes were juxtaposed. With these works Wesselmann began to concentrate on a few details of the figure such as hands, feet, and breasts, surrounded by flowers and objects. The Bedroom Paintings shifted the focus and scale of the attendant objects around a nude; these objects are small in relation to the nude, but become major, even dominant elements when the central element is a body part. The breast of a woman concealed behind a wall appeared in a box among Wesselmann\\'s sculpted still life elements:\\u200a100\\u200a in a piece entitled Bedroom Tit Box, a key work that “...in its realness and internal scale (the scale relationships between the elements) represents the basic idea of the Bedroom Painting”.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\nWesselmann made Still Life #59, five panels that form a large, complex  dimensional, freestanding painting: here too the elements are enlarged, and part of a telephone can be seen.  A nail-polish bottle is tipped up on one side, and there is a vase of roses with a crumpled handkerchief next to it, and the framed portrait of a woman, actress Mary Tyler Moore, whom Wesselmann considered as the ideal prototype girlfriend. These are works in which he made more recognizable portraits, with a less anonymous feel. In Bedroom painting #12, he inserted a self-portrait. Still Life #60 appeared in 1974: the monumental outline, almost 26 feet (7.9 m) long, of the sunglasses acts as a frame for the lipstick, nail polish and jewelry; a microcosm of contemporary femininity that Wesselmann took to the level of gigantism.\\nHis Smokers continued to change: he introduced the hand, with polished fingernails sparkling in the smoke.\\nIn 1973 he brought to an end the series devoted to the Great American Nude with The Great American Nude #100. But of course the incontrovertible sensuality of Wesselmann\\'s nudes was constantly accompanied by an ironic guiding thread that was clearly revealed in the artist\\'s own words: “Painting, sex, and humor are the most important things in my life.\"\\nIn 1978 Wesselmann started work on a new series of Bedroom Paintings. In these works he revised the formal construction of the composition, which was now cut by a diagonal, with one entire section being taken up by a woman\\'s face in the very near foreground.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nIn 1980 Wesselmann published the monograph Tom Wesselmann, an autobiography written under the pseudonym Slim Stealingworth.\\nHis second daughter, Kate, was born; previous children were Jenny and Lane.\\nIn 1983 Wesselmann was seized by the idea of doing a drawing in steel, as if the lines on paper could be lifted off and placed on a wall.  Once in place the drawings appeared to be drawn directly on the wall.  This idea preceded the available technology for lasers to mechanically cut metal with the accuracy Wesselmann needed.  He had to invest in the development of a system that could accomplish this, but it took another year for that to be ready.\\nThe incorporation of negative space that had begun in the Drop-Out series was continued into a new medium and format. They started out as works in black and white, enabling him to redevelop the theme of the nude and its composition. Wesselmann took his idea further and decided to make them in color as well.\\nAs well as colored metal nudes, in 1984 he started working on rapid landscape sketches that were then enlarged and fabricated in aluminum.\\nObliged by the use of metals to experiment with various techniques, Wesselmann  cut works in aluminum by hand; for steel he researched and developed the first artistic use of laser-cut metal. Computerized imaging had not yet been developed.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nWesselmann\\'s metal works continued to go through a constant metamorphosis: My Black Belt (1990), a seventies subject, acquired a new vivacity that forcefully defined space in the new medium.\\nThe Drawing Society produced a video directed by Paul Cummings, in which Wesselmann makes a portrait of a model and a work in aluminum.\\n“Since 1993 I’ve basically been an abstract painter. This is what happened: in 1984 I started making steel and aluminum cut-out figures... One day I got muddled up with the remnants and I was struck by the infinite variety of abstract possibilities. That was when I understood I was going back to what I had desperately been aiming for in 1959, and I started making abstract three-dimensional images in cut metal. I was happy and free to go back to what I wanted: but this time not on De Kooning’s terms but on mine\". In this new abstract format Wesselmann preferred a random approach, and made compositions in which the metal cut-outs resembled gestural brushstrokes.\\nHis nudes on canvas of this period rework 1960s images. “[They constitute] an unexpected but highly satisfying nostalgic return to a youthful episode in the very midst of one of the most radical changes of style in Wesselmann’s career. Self-contained and complete in themselves, they seem more likely to stand alone rather than to lead to further reinterpretations of Sixties motifs. In other words they should not be taken as a sign that Wesselmann is embarking on an extended re-engagement with his classic Pop phase...”. In 1999 he made his final Smoker work, Smoker #1 (3-D), as a relief in aluminum.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000–2004 ===\\n\\nIn the last ten years, Wesselmann\\'s health was worsened by heart disease, but his studio output remained constant.\\nThe abstract works display firmer lines and a chromatic range that favored primary colors. Wesselmann acknowledged the influence of Mondrian by choosing titles that recall the earlier painter\\'s works: New York City Beauty (2001). In these years, the influence of Matisse diminished the border between Wesselmann\\'s figurative and abstract styles. In 1960 Wesselmann had been able to view the works of the French master in person at the MoMA\\'s Gouaches Découpées (Gouache Cut-outs) exhibition, and forty years later he paid homage in his Sunset Nudes series. In Sunset Nude with Matisse, 2002, he inserted Matisse\\'s painting La Blouse Roumaine (1939–1940). Wesselmann also derived works from Matisse\\'s cut-outs: Blue Nude (2000), initiated a series of blue nude reliefs sculpted in shaped aluminum.\\nFollowing surgery for his heart condition, Tom Wesselmann died of complications on December 17, 2004. His last major paintings of the series Sunset Nudes (2003/2004) were shown after his death at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York in April 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1957 Wesselmann met Claire Selley, another Cooper Union student who was to become his friend, model, and in 1963, his wife. They had two daughters and a son.:\\u200a102\\u200a:\\u200a117\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nThe years following Wesselmann\\'s death were marked by a renewed interest in his work.  Museo d’Arte Contemporanea Roma (MACRO) exhibited a retrospective in 2005, accompanied by a comprehensive catalogue.  The following year L&M Arts in New York held a major exhibition of works from the 1960s.  Two galleries; Maxwell Davidson and Yvon Lambert, jointly showed the Drop-Out series in New York in 2007.  This coincided with the release of a new monograph on the artist, written by John Wilmerding and published by Rizzoli, Tom Wesselmann, His Voice and Vision.\\nWesselmann was a self-described fan of country music,:\\u200a102\\u200a and sometimes incorporated operating radios, TVs, or other sound elements into his works.:\\u200a96\\u200a:\\u200a103\\u200a A retrospective show Tom Wesselmann und die Pop Art : pictures on the wall of your heart (2008–2009) at Städtische Galerie in Ravensburg, Germany featured music recordings of his band, courtesy of his estate.:\\u200a96\\u200a\\nAnother show, in 2010 by Maxwell Davidson, Tom Wesselmann: Plastic Works, was the first ever survey of Wesselmann\\'s work in formed plastic.  A lifetime retrospective of drawings, Tom Wesselmann Draws, was shown at Haunch of Venison Gallery, New York, and then traveled to The Museum of Fine Art, Fort Lauderdale, FL, at Nova Southeastern University, and  The Kreeger Museum in Washington, DC.  A lifetime retrospective, the first in North America, opened at The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in May, 2012, and travelled to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Cincinnati Art Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nShaped canvas\\nPop Art\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nExhibition catalog: Galleria Flora Bigai Venice, Italy, S.

       "  'James T. Nutt (born November 28, 1938) is an American artist who was a founding member of the Chicago surrealist art movement known as the Chicago Imagists, or the Hairy Who.  Though his work is inspired by the same pop culture that inspired Pop Art, journalist Web Behrens says Nutt\\'s \"paintings, particularly his later works, are more accomplished than those of the more celebrated Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.\"  According to Museum of Contemporary Art curator Lynne Warren, Nutt is \"the premier artist of his generation\".

He is married to fellow-artist and Hairy Who member Gladys Nilsson.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJim Nutt was born in 1938 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.  He attended college at the University of Kansas, then the University of Pennsylvania, then Washington University in St. Louis, then the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he met his future wife, fellow artist Gladys Nilsson.\\n\\n\\n== Art career ==\\nIn 1963 Nilsson and Nutt were introduced to School of the Art Institute of Chicago art history professor Whitney Halstead, who became a teacher, mentor, and friend.

In 1964 Nilsson and Nutt became youth instructors at the Hyde Park Art Center.\\n\\n\\n== Hairy Who ==\\nIn 1964, Jim Nutt and Gladys Nilsson began to teach children\\'s classes at the Hyde Park Art Center in Chicago.  They and James Falconer approached the center\\'s exhibitions director, Don Baum, with the idea of a group show consisting of the three of them and Art Green and Suellen Rocca.  Baum agreed, and also suggested they include Karl Wirsum.\\nThe name of the group show, \"Hairy Who?\", became the name of the group.  It was coined by Karl Wirsum as a reference to WFMT art critic Harry Bouras.  There were exhibitions at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969.  The 1968 exhibition traveled to the San Francisco Art Institute, and the last show, in 1969, traveled to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n== Later career ==\\nIn 1969, the influential Chicago gallery owner Phyllis Kind agreed to represent Nutt and Gladys Nilsson, giving both of them their first solo shows.

       "  'Paul Henry Ramirez (born 1963 in El Paso, Texas, U.S.) is an American contemporary artist known for his biomorphic abstractionist paintings. As his figural based paintings evolved to include geometrics, in 2010, Ramirez coined the term \"biogeomorphic abstraction\" to describe his own bold painting style, a fusion of biomorphic and geometric forms. He also gained notability for his site-specific installations as his paintings began to expand outside the confines of the canvas edges onto the walls of the gallery space. These site-specific installations gradually evolved to encompass the whole gallery space, creating a full environmental experience. Donald Kuspit, scholar and art critic, describes Ramirez as “an important new kind of abstract painter . . . an abstractionist playing with color and form to exciting imaginative effect.”\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nRamirez began creating site-specific installations in 1994, combining drawings, paintings, objects, sculpture, music, dance, and furniture in dialogue with architectural space and architectural elements, sometimes in collaboration with sound designers, dance choreographers, costume designers, and furniture designers. His \"total environments\" are intended to invite viewers to experience in addition to observe, to feel as if “they are coming into the belly of a painting” as they enter his world — his installation. These were first featured in New York City alternative exhibition spaces including the Drawing Center (1994), Clock Tower Gallery (1995) and Franklin Furnace (1995); and at Caren Golden Fine Art, New York (1998).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nRamirez moved from his native Texas to New Jersey in 1985, then to New York City a few years later to design window and interior displays for retailers Henri Bendel, Charivari, and Takashimaya. In 1994, he set up a studio in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, later moving his studio to the Motor Arts Building studio complex at the Grounds For Sculpture, Hamilton, New Jersey. He is represented by Ryan Lee Gallery, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nRamirez\\'s work can be found in the permanent collections of the Austin Museum of Art, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Crocker Art Museum, El Paso Museum of Art, Hammer Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, Kresge Art Museum, Newark Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum, Tarble Arts Center, The Hyde Collection, and Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPaul Henry Ramirez official website.\\nRYAN LEE Gallery official website.',\n",
       "  'Peter Howson OBE (born 27 March 1958) is a Scottish painter. He was a British official war artist in 1993 during the Bosnian War.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nPeter Howson was born in London of Scottish parents and moved with his family to Prestwick, Ayrshire, when he was four. His grandmother gave him a small set of oil paints when he was six. He was raised in a religious family and the first ever painting he did was a Crucifixion, when he was 6 years old. At school he was bullied but found solace in art, and was greatly inspired by his art teacher, Helen Lees, who offered him extra tuition. He trained at Glasgow School of Art but was surprised to fail the first year and forced to repeat. He hated the second year in which he was asked to paint still lifes and dropped out, joining the army in 1977. He trained in the army at Glencorse Barracks near Edinburgh. After less than a year in the army he re-enrolled in Glasgow School of Art in 1979 under a Hospitalfield Scholarship, but left again in 1981 without graduating.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nHis work has encompassed a number of themes. His early works are typified by very masculine working-class men, most famously in The Heroic Dosser (1987). Later, in 1993, he was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum of London, to be the official war artist for the Bosnian War. Here he produced some of his most shocking and controversial work detailing the atrocities which were taking place at the time, like Plum Grove (1994). One painting in particular, Croatian and Muslim, detailing a rape created controversy partly because of its explicit subject matter but also because Howson had painted it from the victims\\' accounts. He was the official war painter at the Kosovo War for the London Times. In 1996 the University of Strathclyde awarded him a Doctor of Letters.\\nIn 1999 he returned to Bosnia both to counter public opinion regarding his earlier comments and to purge his own personal demons encountered on his first visit. The second period affected him deeply, seeing many atrocities.\\n\\nIn more recent years his work has exhibited strong religious themes which some say is linked to the treatment of his alcoholism and drug addiction at the Castle Craig Hospital in Peebles in 2000, after which he converted to Christianity. An example of this is  Judas (2002) which \"...is a key work from the series of paintings conveying the artist\\'s decline into and recovery from alcohol and drug addiction and his new found faith in Christianity.\"\\nHis work has appeared in other media, with his widest exposure arguably for a British postage stamp he did in 1999 to celebrate engineering achievements for the millennium. In addition his work has been used on album covers by Live (Throwing Copper), The Beautiful South (Quench) and Jackie Leven (Fairytales for Hardmen). His work features in major collections including Ben Uri Gallery and Museum, Edinburgh City Art Centre, Glasgow Museums Resource Centre, Ferens Art Gallery, Guildhall Art Gallery, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, High Life Highland Exhibitions Unit, Huntarian Art Gallery, Jerwood Collection, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, National Galleries of Scotland, Nottingham City Museums and Galleries, Rozelle House Galleries, The Dick Institute, Fitzwilliam Museum, The Fleming Collection, Ingram Collection of Modern British Art and The Wilson.\\nHowson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in October 2009 as one of the Queen\\'s Birthday Honours. In November 2010, BBC Scotland aired a documentary named \"The Madness of Peter Howson\" which followed the final stages of the completion of a grand commission for show in the renovated St Andrew\\'s Cathedral and also dealt with Howson\\'s struggle with mental illness and Asperger\\'s syndrome.\\nIn September 2014, Howson suggested he would hand back his OBE, predominantly because of his dislike of British foreign policy but it is not clear if he ever did so.\\nThe film Prophecy, directed by Charlie Paul and produced by Lucy Paul, is an intimate exploration of a single oil painting and the first major film to reveal the motive and techniques behind each stroke of paint Peter Howson creates. With a remarkably acute focus, the film follows the creation of Howson\\'s painting Prophecy, its exhibition and sale, as it travels from the artist\\'s studio in Glasgow to New York, before returning to London to enter the collection of a private buyer.\\nIn May 2023 the Edinburgh City Art Centre gave Howson a major retrospective exhibition of over 100 of his paintings after four years of planning.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nMonographs\\n\\nBerkoff, Stephen, Peter Howson, Flowers (2005)\\nHeller, Robert, Peter Howson, Momentum (2003)\\nJackson, Allan, A Different Man, Mainstream Publishing (1997)\\nHeller, Robert, Peter Howson, Mainstream Publishing (1993)\\nExhibition Catalogues\\n\\nHarrowing of Hell, 24 October - 22 November 2008, Flowers East\\nChristos Aneste, 18 March - 7 May 2005, Flowers East\\nInspired by the Bible, 6–20 August 2004, New College, Edinburgh\\nThe Stations of the Cross, 11 April - 18 May 2003, Flowers East\\nThe Third Step, 13 April - 4 June 2002, Flowers East\\nThe Rake\\'s Progress, 12 January - 11 February 1996, Flowers East\\nBlind Leading the Blind, 9 November- 8 December 1991, Flowers East\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPeter Howson profile, FlowersGallery.com\\nPeter Howson.net\\nPeter Howson website\\nGlasgow Print Studio (view Howson works on-line)\\nPeter Howson profile,  Asperger-Syndrome.me.uk\\nDonald Kuspit, Bipolar Paintings: PETER HOWSON, THE SCOTTISH BOSCH, artnet.com\\n41 artworks by or after Peter Howson at the Art UK site\\nPeter Howson at National Portrait Gallery, London (npg.org.uk)\\n\"HOWSON, Peter John\".

       "  'Wu Guanzhong (simplified Chinese: 吴冠中; traditional Chinese: 吳冠中; pinyin: Wú Guànzhōng; 29 August 1919 – 25 June 2010) was a contemporary Chinese painter widely recognized as a founder of modern Chinese painting. He is considered to be one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. Wu\\'s artworks display both Western and Eastern influences, such as the Western style of Fauvism and the Eastern style of Chinese calligraphy. Wu painted various aspects of China, including its architecture, plants, animals, people, as well as many of its landscapes and waterscapes, in a style reminiscent of the impressionist painters of the early 1900s. He was also a writer on contemporary Chinese art.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nWu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province, in 1919. His family wanted him to become a teacher, as his father had been. In 1935, Wu passed the entrance exam and studied electrical engineering at Zhejiang Industrial School (浙江公立工业专门学校, a technical school of Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou. While in engineering school, Wu met an art student named Zhu Dequn who was studying at the National Hangzhou Academy of Art.  During a trip to Zhu’s school, Wu got his first look at art and fell \"madly in love\" with it. Against his father’s wishes, in 1936 he transferred to the art academy, studying both Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897–1971), Fang Ganmin (1906–1984) and Li Chaoshi (1893-1971). \\nWu went through many trials and challenges during his years in college before he could master his craft. In 1937 the Sino-Japanese War began and the campus had to pick up and relocate in order to get out of the way of the invading Japanese army. During the constant movement during the war, Wu was able to see many different locations. He considered the adventures as a necessary journey to becoming a man and building his character. Wu benefitted greatly from the many teachers who taught him to paint and the rough journey to becoming a man.  \\nIn 1942 he graduated from Hangzhou National Academy of Art and tried to find a job. During the war jobs were hard to find and Wu took a part-time job as a substitute teacher. He later found a job as a watercolor and drawing teacher in the Architecture Department of Chongqing University.\\nAfter Wu graduated he continued to hone his craft and studied with some of his old colleagues from school, like Zhu Dequn, Li Lincan and Zheng Wei. Each of these friends continued their art careers and left their mark on the art scene.  \\nIn 1946 Wu applied for one of the two art study abroad spots and was the best applicant who applied; this was in part to his French language studies. 1947 traveled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux Arts on the government scholarship. Even though France was still recovering from World War II, Wu was completely enthralled with the art he saw there. He visited all of the city\\'s major museums within the first few days of his arrival. Wu was always a tremendous fan of French and European art. While in Europe, Wu realized that the many cultural and religious differences between Europe and China made it difficult for him to understand and appreciate some of the art. He took great interest in the modern art of France, especially Post-Impressionists such as van Gogh, Gauguin and Cézanne.  Wu loved van Gogh the most because of van Gogh’s passion for art and the internal torment he endured. He also identified with the hardships that Gauguin felt when he left Paris for a South Pacific island in order to find his own personal ideal. Wu\\'s trip to France helped him grasp the idea of form and the basic meaning of art. The study abroad trip also led to formalism becoming the basic underlying element of his art and studying in France helped him better understand formalism.\\nWu returned to China in the summer of 1950 to the excitement that was brought by the new People’s Republic of China government. The government assigned jobs to all of the returning students who came back after the new government took control. Everyone felt anxious and excited to contribute to the building of a new nation. Wu introduced aspects of Western art to his students at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing, where he taught from 1950 to 1953. He was excited to be the first Chinese artist to return from France with knowledge and theoretical framework for French modernism. While teaching, many peers criticized him because of jealousy over his job and because he was the only painter practicing formalism. The Academy was known to have been dominated by social realism, and Wu was called \"a fortress of bourgeois formalism\". The issues became so bad he could no longer stay at the Central Academy and transferred. Between 1953 and 1964 he taught at Tsinghua University, and then Beijing Fine Arts Normal College. As a professor Wu was able to take many trips around the country and discover the expanse that was the new China.  Wu was full of ambition and energy and travelled to many locations where his peers wouldn’t go. He enjoyed the freedom of travel, which allowed him to paint or sketch wherever and whenever he wanted. This is when Wu made a transition to landscape since he travelled all over the country. He was later appointed a Professor at the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts, Beijing in 1964.\\nIn August 1966, at the outset of Mao Zedong\\'s Cultural Revolution, Wu was prohibited from painting and writing about art, and many of his early works were destroyed. In 1970, at the age of 51, he and his wife were separated and assigned to almost 3 years of hard labor in the countryside as part of the Communist Party\\'s vast re-education program.  Wu stated, “Life was only planting rice, carrying coal, criticizing one another, and fighting one another…The only thing that no one was allowed to do was paint.” \\nFollowing that period, he was only allowed to paint on Sundays (his day off from the fields) or on holidays.  He heard of artists being persecuted and even killed, so he burned his nude paintings since they would be severely criticized and frowned upon. Wu did not suffer too much physical harm, because he had destroyed many of his own paintings, but this caused him much emotional harm. Finally in 1972, he was allowed to return to Beijing to paint hotel murals and decorations.\\nDuring the 1970s, Wu changed his style based on what others were doing at the time. He started painting with oil and watercolor in a Western style until he returned to Beijing and saw other artists using watercolor in the traditional Chinese style. In 1975 a Chinese art association in Japan wanted some traditional Chinese ink paintings to exhibit. Once again Wu changed his style to match the specifications, and his work became a great hit. From here Wu moved on to another phase where he painted with oil and concentrated on the human body and the beauty of form. Wu also realized he could achieve the same beauty and form through landscape while using Chinese ink and color on paper.\\nIt was not until after Mao\\'s death in 1976 that Wu, like many of his peers, was able to return to his art-making. This opened up the door for artists to branch out international.  Unfortunately for most of the artists, there was an immense gap in artistic ideas between China and the rest of the world.  The only one who seemed able to bridge this artistic gap was Wu. With the newfound freedom, Wu was able to break away from the old constraints and get back to the formalism style he originally loved.  Along with being able to paint again, he was able to be more of a public figure in the art scene without fear of retribution.  He wrote an essay for a May 1979 issue of Meishu titled “The Beauty of Form in Painting”. He discussed his theory of formalism in the article as \\n“A vast number of workers in art now hope for the opening of European modern painting to them, to discuss the scientific nature of the beauty of form. It is the microscope and surgical knife of formal art as a means to enrich and develop heritage. Oil painting must be nationalized; Chinese painting must be modernized. It seems that only after we have seen the Japanese painter Higashiyama Kai’s explorations have we come to have a clear understanding about the problems of uniting the East and West.” \\nWu has written many other articles based on his version of form and how it applies to modernism.  He considered himself primarily a painter and not a theorist. He had the approach of going out and looking at nature to find something that piqued his interest. Then he would start with a preliminary sketch of what it was that he saw. Next he spent a great deal of time in the studio trying to figure out the best way to show the power of the form of the object. He would then paint quickly and impulsively with whatever European of Chinese brush felt right. Wu would go on painting for hours until he was too emotionally drained to continue.\\nHe had his first professional solo exhibition in 1979, and his career took off in the 1980s.  He has been the solo exhibitionist in over ten and been part of a joint exhibition in over ten others.\\nIn 1991 Wu was made an Officier de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.\\nEarly in his career Guanzhong adopted the pen name Tu, which he used to sign his work.\\nWu died at the age of 90, during the night of June 25, 2010, in Beijing Hospital.\\n\\n\\n== Paintings ==\\n\\n\\n=== Twin Swallows ===\\nAmong many of Wu Guanzhong’s paintings, Twin Swallows was the most outstanding and representative of his search for a synthesis of Western elements into traditional Chinese painting. It is a painting that captures both the static form of traditional Jiangnan architecture and the motion of two swallows as they fly toward a tree. Geometric shapes, especially rectangles, dominate half of the painting. For example, the front walls of the houses are horizontally placed white rectangles with simple black and gray lines to depict the edges and rooftop of each building. Doorways were painted in the same minimalistic manner, yet the contrast between the darkness inside the building with the lighter door frame is prominent enough to create a sense of depth. Wu’s attention to perspective and depth in Twin Swallow is a factor that distinguishes himself from many other traditional guohua painters. Although the white walls in Twin Swallows may seem like the dominating elements in this painting, it is in fact the pair of swallows that reveals Wu’s intention behind this painting. In the 1950s, Wu returned from France to his homeland. It was also a time when Chinese art entered the phase of socialist realism. This artistic movement had encouraged many artists to create artwork in order to contribute to the Chinese society. Similarly, Wu felt obligated to pass on the knowledge that he had gained in France to the younger generations in China in order to promote the idea of a synthesis among Western and traditional Chinese art.\\n\\n\\n=== Lion Grove Garden ===\\nLion Grove Garden was painted in 1983. The subject of this painting, Lion Grove, is the largest rockery in Suzhou. Wu Guanzhong had successfully incorporated the use of lines, planes, and dots in this painting. The lines were used to express a sense of freedom, which was also what Chinese artists enjoyed after the Cultural Revolution. Unlike traditional guohua artists, Wu’s ink outlines no longer suggest the physical form of the rocks, but instead seem to suggest how Wu perceive this landscape. The forms of the rocks are shaped in diverse ways, some being round, uneven, and hollow. He paid careful attention to the ups and downs, concave and convex, caverns and peaks, and sizes of the rocks. Although the structure of the rockery is hardly identifiable in this painting, this sense of ambiguity further encourages viewers to use their imagination and look beyond what is presented in front of their eyes. About two-thirds of the paintings consist of sinuous lines and splashes of ink and colored dots, of green, yellow, purple and red, that reinforces the spontaneity and fluidity of the painting as each dot sparkles across the painting. Artistic element of planes, such as the rooftop of Suzhou-style pavilion, the bridge, and the cloister add a hint of realistic element. The foreground of this painting is a lightly shaded pale grey water where the fish reside. Although the foreground isn’t as eye-catching as the rockery, it grounds the complex elements in a stable dimension.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nMost of Wu’s early works were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  It is difficult to track down works from his early days.  Wu had an exhibit in 1942 when he was in school and it was hosted by the Sha Ping Youth Palace.\\nWu Guanzhong has had solo exhibitions in major art galleries and museums around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, Korea, France, England and the USA. His paintings were exhibited at the British Museum in 1992; Wu was the first living Chinese artist to have an exhibition there. One of his paintings, Seascape at Beidaihe (1977), was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of an exhibition of paintings from the collection of art dealer Robert H. Ellsworth [1].   His work may also be seen in the collection of the Hong Kong Museum of Art.\\nIn 2008, Wu donated 113 works to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). This donation is the largest Wu Guanzhong donation to a public museum.  In 2010, Wu donated works to the Hong Kong Art Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Quotes by Wu Guanzhong ==\\n“Through painting landscapes I have grown to love my motherland even more and wish to be forever intoxicated in her embrace.” \\nThis particular quote gives us deeper insight to the deep appreciation for China and the land that Wu Guanzhong had.\\n“For people’s hearts to communicate, there must be genuine emotion to strike a chord. Whether the feelings and perceptions of modern Chinese can find resonance in the West depends on the emotions, if they are true or false. Intelligent viewers can discern what is real and what is false.” \\nHere, Wu Guanzhong explains that in order for people (such as those of the East and the West) to communicate there must be real emotions that can strike a chord with the other\\'s audience.\\n“Abstract beauty is the heart of the beauty of figurative art. It is a natural thing to which we all respond. As a child loves to play with a kaleidoscope, so everyone likes pure form and color.” \\nWu Guanzhong explains abstract beauty, which shows his appreciation for abstract art along with his traditional Chinese training.\\n\"So often there is conflict between them, and this is my greatest sorrow....Whatever I have written is to try to help our own people to understand and to get rid of their fear and suspicion of abstraction in Western art. So I can only start talking from a point of semi-abstract art, which is easier to understand.

       "  'Kalev Mark Kostabi (born November 27, 1960) is an American painter, sculptor and composer.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nKostabi was born in Los Angeles on November 27, 1960, to Estonian immigrants Kaljo and Rita Kostabi. He was raised in Whittier, California and studied drawing and painting at California State University, Fullerton. In 1982 he moved to New York and by 1984 he became a prominent figure of the East Village art scene, winning the \"Proliferation Prize\" from the East Village Eye for being in more art exhibitions than any other New York artist.\\n\\n\\n== Artwork ==\\nKostabi is most known for his paintings of faceless figures which often comment on contemporary political, social and psychological issues, and which have visual stylistic roots in the work of Giorgio de Chirico and Fernand Léger.\\nBeyond traditional art world exposure, Kostabi has designed album covers for Guns N\\' Roses (Use Your Illusion) and The Ramones (¡Adios Amigos!), Seether (Holding Onto Strings Better Left to Fray), Jimmy Scott (Holding Back The Years), Glint (Sound in Silence), RK: Roman Klun (Kingsway), Psychotica (Espina) and numerous products including a Swatch watch, Alessi vases, Rosenthal espresso cups, Ritzenhoff milk glasses, and a Giro d\\'Italia pink jersey.\\nKostabi is also known for his many collaborations with other artists including Enzo Cucchi, Arman, Howard Finster, Tadanori Yokoo, Enrico Baj and Paul Kostabi.\\nRetrospective exhibitions of Kostabi\\'s paintings have been held at the Mitsukoshi Museum in Tokyo (1992) and the Art Museum of Estonia in Tallinn (1998). Kostabi\\'s work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery in Washington D.C., the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Yale University Art Gallery the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome and the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands.\\nHis work was published on the cover of the book East Village \\'85 published by Pelham Press and his paintings were included prominently in numerous East Village shows in museums and galleries internationally. Matteo Editore published a book on Kostabi titled Mark Kostabi and the East Village scene 1983–1987 written by Baird Jones. During the mid-1980s he developed a media persona by publishing self-interviews which commented on the commodification of contemporary art, which led to theories on Kostabi\\'s cultural relevance in various sociology books including \"Life: The Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality\" by Neal Gabler and \"Culture or Trash?: A Provocative View of Contemporary Painting, Sculpture, and Other Costly Commodities\" by James Gardner.\\nIn 1986, Kostabi designed the Bloomingdales shopping bag. By 1987 his works were widely exhibited in New York galleries and throughout the United States, in Japan, Germany and Australia.\\nIn 1988, inspiring extensive international press coverage, he founded Kostabi World, his large New York studio known for openly employing numerous painting assistants and idea people. In 1996 he began dividing his time between New York and Rome and consequently his work\\'s already strong presence in the Italian art scene became much more prominent. The influential Italian critic and curator Achille Bonito Oliva included Kostabi in several major exhibitions including at the Galleria Nazionale d\\'Arte di Roma. The critic, curator and TV personality Vittorio Sgarbi curated a 150 painting Kostabi show at the Chiostro del Bramante in Rome in 2006.\\nHis permanent public works include a mural in Palazzo dei Priori in Arezzo, Italy, a large bronze sculpture in the central square of San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy, a bronze portrait of Pope John Paul II in Velletri, Italy and a large bronze sculpture, \"Eternal Embrace,\" in Largo Villa Glori in Terni, Italy.\\nIn Kostabi\\'s works there is an extensive range of citation and self-citation, which are typically postmodern techniques.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\n\\nKostabi has performed his musical compositions as a soloist and with other musicians including Ornette Coleman, Jerry Marotta, Tony Levin, Stefano di Battista, Gene Pritsker, Mark Egan, Lukas Ligeti, Dave Taylor (trombonist),Chris Parker, Tommy Campbell, Lara St. John, John Clark, Adam Holzman, Aaron Comess, John Lee and Paul Kostabi. His compositions have also been performed independently by Kathleen Supové, Rein Rannap, Kristjan Järvi, Mark Berman, Michael Wolff (musician), Marko Martin, Peter Jarvis, Kai Schumacher and the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra.\\nHis debut album, I Did It Steinway, was released on Artists Only Records in October 1998. Produced by Dale Ashley and Charles Coleman, the album features original compositions by Kostabi, and was recorded at Merkin Concert Hall in New York City.\\nKostabi\\'s other releases include: Songs For Sumera, New Alliance, The Spectre Of Modernism, Kostabeat, Grace Notes \"Closer To First\" and \"In Between and Beyond.\"\\n\\n\\n== Media/cable/TV/film ==\\nKostabi has been profiled on 60 Minutes, Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, A Current Affair, Nightwatch (with Charlie Rose), The Oprah Winfrey Show, Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, Nonsolomoda, West 57th, CNN, MTV and numerous television programs throughout Europe and Japan. In print he has been featured in various publications such as The New York Times, People, Vogue, Architectural Digest, The Face, The Sunday Telegraph and Tema Celeste.\\nIn 1989, Kostabi was mentioned in the TV series Miami Vice, in Season 5, episode 14: \"The Lost Madonna\".\\nIn 1991, Kostabi was also mentioned in the controversial novel American Psycho, by Bret Easton Ellis.\\nFrom the year 2000 to 2010 Kostabi wrote an advice column for artists, \"Ask Mark Kostabi\", for Artnet Magazine.\\nKostabi is the subject of numerous documentary films, most notably Bottom Line: The Kostabi Phenomenon directed by Peter Bach, Con Artist directed by Michael Sladek, and Jedermann directed by Paul Tschinkel. Kostabi has a prominent role in the Emmy award-winning documentary The Art of Failure: Chuck Connelly Not for Sale directed by Jeff Stimmel. \"Full Circle: The Kostabi Story\", directed by Sabrina Digregorio.\\nKostabi produces a cable TV show, The Kostabi Show, where noted art critics and celebrities compete to title his paintings for cash awards. The Kostabi Show was previously known as both Name That Painting and Title This. Kostabi received significant backlash for his remarks about gay men during the AIDS crisis. In a 1989 issue of Vanity Fair, Kostabi said, \"These museum curators, that are for the most part homosexual, have controlled the art world in the \\'80s. Now they\\'re all dying of AIDS, and although I think it\\'s sad, I know it\\'s for the better. Because homosexual men are not actively participating in the perpetuation of human life.\" While Kostabi apologized in Newsday, saying, \"I feel terrible for saying something that was an unfair generalization based on a few specific experiences with gay curators and critics that left me very angry,\" he retracted the apology ten days later, stating that he was pressured to apologize by Abbeville Press, the publisher of the then upcoming Kostabi: The Early Years. Kostabi told the Post\\'s Page Six, \"They made me write all these phony apologies.\" He reaffirmed his previously stated opinions on gay men, arguing again that gay men dominate the art world and \"that\\'s why there\\'s so much bad art in the world.\"\\n\\n\\n== Literature ==\\nMark Kostabi (self published), \"Kostabi\", 1980.\\nKostabi, Mark (1985).

       "  'Alighiero Fabrizio Boetti known as Alighiero e Boetti (16 December 1940 – 24 February 1994) was an Italian conceptual artist, considered to be a member of the art movement Arte Povera.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nBoetti is most famous for a series of embroidered maps of the world, Mappa, created between 1971 and his death in 1994. Boetti\\'s work was typified by his notion of \\'twinning\\', leading him to add \\'e\\' (and) between his names, \\'stimulating a dialectic exchange between these two selves\\'.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nAlighiero Boetti was born in Turin, to Corrado Boetti, a lawyer, and Adelina Marchisio, a violinist. Boetti abandoned his studies at the business school of the University of Turin to work as an artist. Already in his early years, he had profound and wide-ranging theoretical interests and studied works on such diverse topics as philosophy, alchemy and esoterics. Among the preferred authors of his youth were the German writer Hermann Hesse and the Swiss-German painter and Bauhaus teacher Paul Klee. Boetti also had a continuing interest in mathematics and music.\\nAt seventeen, Boetti discovered the works of the German painter Wols and the cut canvases of Argentine-Italian artist Lucio Fontana. Boetti\\'s own works of his late teen years, however, are oil paintings somewhat reminiscent of the Russian painter Nicolas de Staël. At age twenty, Boetti moved to Paris to study engraving. In 1962, while in France he met art critic and writer Annemarie Sauzeau, whom he was to marry in 1964 and with whom he had two children, Matteo (1967) and Agata (1972). From 1974 to 1976, he travelled to Guatemala, Ethiopia, Sudan. Boetti was passionate about non-western cultures, particularly of central and southern Asia, and travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan numerous times in the 1970s and 1980s, although Afghanistan became inaccessible to him following the Soviet invasion in 1979. In 1975, he went back to New York.\\nActive as an artist from the early 1960s to his premature death in 1994, Boetti developed a significant body of diverse works that were often both poetic and pleasing to the eye while at the same time steeped in his diverse theoretical interests and influenced by his extensive travels.\\nHe died of a brain tumour in Rome in 1994 at the age of 53.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Arte Povera ===\\nFrom 1963 to 1965, Boetti began to create works out of then unusual materials such as plaster, masonite, plexiglass, light fixtures and other industrial materials. His first solo show was in 1967, at the Turin gallery of Christian Stein. Later that year participated in an exhibition at Galleria La Bertesca in the Italian city of Genoa, with a group of other Italian artists that referred to their works as Arte Povera, or poor art, a term subsequently widely propagated by Italian art critic Germano Celant.\\nBoetti continued to work with a wide array of materials, tools, and techniques, including ball pens (biro) and even the postal system. Some of Boetti\\'s artistic strategies are considered typical for Arte Povera, namely the use of the most modest materials and techniques, to take art off its pedestal of attributed \"dignity\". Boetti also took a keen interest in the relationship between chance and order, in various systems of classification (grids, maps, etc.), and non-Western traditions and cultural practices, influenced by his Afghanistan and Pakistan travels.\\nAn example of his Arte Povera work is Lampada annuale (Yearly Lamp) (1966), a single, outsized light bulb in a mirror-lined wooden box, which randomly switches itself on for eleven seconds each year. This work focuses both on the transformative powers of energy, and on the possibilities and limitations of chance – the likelihood of a viewer being present at the moment of illumination is remote. In 1967, Boetti produced the piece Manifesto, a poster listing the names of artists that make up Boetti\\'s creative background.\\nDossier Postale (1969–70) consists of a series of letters which were sent to 26 well-known recipients, primarily artists (Giulio Paolini, Bruce Nauman), art critics (Lucy Lippard, Arturo Schwarz), dealers (Konrad Fischer, Leo Castelli), and collectors (Giuseppe Panza, Corrado Levi) active at the time. Boetti sent the envelopes to imaginary addresses, thus each letter was returned to the artist undelivered, demonstrating Boetti\\'s preoccupation with improbability and chance.\\n\\n\\n=== 1972–1994 ===\\nBoetti disassociated himself from the Arte Povera movement in 1972 and moved to Rome, without, however, completely abandoning some of its democratic, anti-elitist, strategies. In 1973, he renamed himself as a dual persona Alighiero e Boetti (\"Alighiero and Boetti\") reflecting the opposing factors presented in his work: the individual and society, error and perfection, order and disorder. Already in his double-portrait I Gemelli begun in 1968 and published as a postcard, Boetti had altered photographs so that he appeared to be holding the hand of his identical twin.\\nHe often collaborated with both artists and non-artists, giving them significant freedom in their contributions to his works. For instance, one of the better known types of his works consists of colored letters embroidered in grids (\"arazzi\", meaning wall hangings or tapestries) on canvases of varying sizes, the letters upon closer inspection reading as short phrases in Italian, for instance Ordine e Disordine (\"Order and Disorder\") or Fuso Ma Non Confuso (\"Mixed but not mixed up\"), or similar truisms and wordplays. To create these pictures, Boetti worked with artisan embroiderers in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to whom he gave his designs but increasingly handed over the process of selecting and combining the colors and thus deciding the final aesthetic look of the work.\\nSimilarly, in the lavori biro (ball pen paintings), he would invite friends and acquaintances, to fill large colored sections of the multi-part work by ball pen, typically alternating between a man and a woman from one sheet to another. Boetti made his first ballpoint ink drawings in 1972–73 and continued through the late 1980s. The largest of all Boetti\\'s Biro works are the four versions of Ononimo (1973), with their progressions of eleven separate panels, each hand-coloured in biro (two in blue biro and two in red).\\nHis most ambitious project is a large embroidered piece titled Classificazione dei mille fiumi piu lunghi del mondo (Classification of the thousand longest rivers in the world (1977).\\nFollowing an invitation by Hans Ulrich Obrist,  the artist published six of his watercolour drawings in Austrian Airlines\\' in flight magazine \\'Sky Lines\\'. To accompany this publication, jigsaws of the images were produced, and were available to passengers on the flights at this time.\\nIn 1986 he took part at the Lucio Amelio\\'s exhibition \"Terrae Motus\". After the 1980 Irpinia earthquake the Neapolitan gallerist asked to the major contemporary artists of that time to realize a work of art about the earthquake; so Boetti realized for this occasion Di palo in frasca nell\\'estate dell\\'anno millenovecentottantasei, accanto al Pantheon, a reflection on the concepts of time and thinking: the monkey stands for the human thought\\'s capacity to jump from a think to another.\\n\\n\\n=== Embroideries ===\\n\\nPerhaps best known is Boetti\\'s series of large embroidered maps of the world, called simply Mappa. After the Six-Day War in June 1967 the artist began to collect newspaper covers featuring maps of war zones.  He then asked his wife to embroider the shapes from the June 1967 map. He pondered the idea of the first large-scale Mappa during his second voyage to Afghanistan in 1971, resulting in a series of woven world maps entitled Territori Occupati. Between 1971 and 1979 he set up the One Hotel with his friend and business partner Gholam Dastaghir in Kabul as a kind of artistic commune and created large colourful embroideries, the most famous of these were the Mappa, world maps in which each country features the design of its national flag. In 1971, Boetti commissioned women at an embroidery school in Kabul to embroider his first map. He initially intended to make only one but went on to commission roughly 150 of them in his lifetime, with no two possessing exactly the same dimensions.\\nBoetti\\'s maps reflect a changing geopolitical world from 1971 to 1994, a period that included the collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Embroidered by up to 500 artisans in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the maps were the result of a collaborative process leaving the design to the geopolitical realities of the time, and the choice of colours to the artisans responsible for the embroidery. The maps delineate the political boundaries of the countries. In one map, the sea is unexpectedly coloured pink rather than blue, as landlocked Afghans had no tradition of mapping, certainly not of oceans. The border texts contain dates or details relative to the work\\'s production, Boetti\\'s signature and sayings, as well as excerpts from Sufi poetry. \\n\\n\"For me the work of the embroidered Mappa is the maximum of beauty. For that work I did nothing, chose nothing, in the sense that: the world is made as it is, not as I designed it, the flags are those that exist, and I did not design them; in short I did absolutely nothing; when the basic idea, the concept, emerges everything else requires no choosing.\" Alighiero e Boetti, 1974\\n\\nThe brightly colored Arazzi works are embroidered pieces made in various sizes that depict sentences drawn from poetry, wisdoms from around the world, or sayings invented by Boetti himself. The Arazzi grandi, containing messages in both Italian and Persian, are each distinct, recording the date when they were created, and containing an elaborate internal code that prescribes the order of the sentences on display. They contrast geometric European letters and flowing Persian calligraphy in checkerboard patterns, alternating bands, grids or cruciform shapes. The dates, carefully noted on each Arazzi grandi, mark a point of captivation for Boetti, as he was deeply interested in the concept of time and its inevitable passing.\\nThe embroidery of each map normally took one to two years and, in some cases, much longer due to geopolitical events. Following the closure of the Afghan border, Boetti was forced to abandon this practice and work remotely from Italy. This work began in his studio in Rome, with the artist outlining the countries in felt-tip pen onto linen, before sending the cloth framework to Afghanistan.  The invasion of Afghanistan by Russian troops in 1979 shifted production completely from Kabul to Peshawar in Pakistan, where the group of Afghan women had taken refuge and where Boetti was only able to reconnect with them through middlemen. It also halted production completely until 1982, with only a few maps being made between 1982 and 1985 During the 1980s Boetti visited Pakistan to meet the men organizing the embroidery. As a European male, however, Boetti was not allowed to visit the camps. He therefore asked photographer Randi Malkin Steinberger, with whom he had collaborated on the book Accanto al Pantheon in Rome, to go to Peshawar in 1990 to photograph the craftswomen at work.\\nA chief example of this series, Mappa del Mondo, 1989 (\"Map of the World, 1989\"), is on view in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York (see Key Works).\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHaving shown in Milan and Turin, Boetti was invited by Harald Szeemann to participate in the seminal exhibition \"Live in your Head. When Attitudes Become Form\" in 1969. Boetti had his first US solo exhibition in New York at John Weber Gallery in 1973. In 1978, he held an anthological exhibition curated by Jean-Christophe Ammann at the Kunsthalle Basel that featured historical works alongside more recent ones. He was the subject of a retrospective in 1992 that traveled to Bonn and Münster, Germany, and Lucerne, Switzerland. He was honored with several exhibitions after his death, most notably at the Galleria Nazionale d\\'Arte Moderna, Rome (1996); the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Vienna in 1997; the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt am Main in 1998; Whitechapel Gallery, London (1999); and Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, Vaduz. The artist took part in Documentas 5 (1972) and 7 (1982) and the Venice Biennale (1978, 1980, 1986, 1990, 1995). In 2001, the Venice Pavillon was completely dedicated to Alighiero e Boetti\\'s work. In 2012, for the exhibition Game Plan, a significant number of works have been lent to the MoMA by Tornabuoni art Gallery.\\n\\n\\n=== Select exhibitions ===\\nGalleria Christian Stein, Turin, Italy, 1967\\nArte Povera, Galleria La Bertesca, Genoa, 1967 (group exhibition)\\nShaman Showman, Galleria De Nieubourg, Milan, Italy, 1969\\nWhen Attitude Becomes Form, curated by Harald Szeemann, Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland,  1969 (group exhibition)\\nIo che prendo il sole a Torino il 24 February 1969, Galleria Sperone, Turin, Italy, 1969.\\nJohn Weber Gallery, New York, 1973\\nMettere al mondo il mondo, Sperone-Fischer Gallery, Rome, Italy, 1973\\nKunstmuseum Lucerne, Switzerland, 1975.\\nKunsthalle Basel, curated by Jean-Christophe Amman, Basel, Switzerland, 1978\\nArt Agency Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, 1980.\\n44th Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy, 1990.\\nSynchronizitaet als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhaenge, Kunstverein, Bonn, Germany; Westfalischer Kunstverein, Munster, Germany; Kunstmuseum, Lucerne, Switzerland, 1992–1993\\nAlternando da 1 a 100 e viceversa, Centre National d\\'Art Contemporain de Grenoble, Grenoble, France, 1993\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, California, 1994\\nP.S.1 Museum, Long Island City, New York, 1994.\\nAlighiero e Boetti, part of the project, Origin and Destination, Societe des Expositions du Palais des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, 1994\\nAlighiero Boetti, Galleria Civica d\\'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Turin, Italy; Musee d\\'Art Moderne, Villeneuve d\\'Ascq, France; Museum Moderner Kunst, Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna, Austria, 1996–97\\nAlighiero Boetti: Mettere al mondo il mondo (\"Bringing the World into the World\") – Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and Galerie Jahrhunderthalle Hoechst, Germany, 1998\\nBoetti; the maverick spirit of Arte Povera, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 1999\\nZero to Infinity, Arte Povera 1962–1972 – Tate Modern, London,[1]\\' Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, 2001–2002 [2]\\nWhen 1 is 2: The Art of Alighiero e Boetti – Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, TX, 2002\\nQuasi Tutto, Galleria d\\'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Bergamo, Italy, 2004.\\n2012 Tate Modern retrospective.\\n\"Alighiero Boetti: Game Plan\" MoMA, NY, 2012.\\n\\n\\n== Key works (selection) ==\\nMappa del Mondo, 1989 (\"Map of the World, 1989\"), Afghan embroidery on fabric, Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York [3] (image)\\nTutto (\"Everything\"), 1994, Afghan embroidery on fabric, collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Frankfurt am Main, Germany [4] (image ).\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 1995, the Archivio Alighiero Boetti, based in Rome, was created for the issuance of certificates of authenticity for works by Boetti.\\nIn 2008, lawsuits were filed between Sperone Westwater Gallery (the artist\\'s primary dealer at the time) and the Archivio Alighiero Boetti (and some family members) over the authenticity of 15 works exhibited and sold by the gallery its 2002 show \"Simmetria Asimmetria\".

Sperone Westwater, in return, sued the Boetti Archive in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for what it alleges is a broad scheme to discredit it by capriciously questioning the authenticity of Boetti artworks it has shown and sold in the United States; this included one that was purchased by the Art Institute of Chicago. In the New York suit, Sperone Westwater asked the judge to make a declaratory judgment that the archive has no moral rights claims and also seeks damages \"for the Defendants\\' injuries to the gallery\\'s business and reputation,\" on counts of breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with business relations.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nLa Tartaruga Gallery (ed.), Il teatro delle mostre (Rome, Lerici editore, 1968, in Italian)\\nAlberto Boatto, Alighiero & Boetti (Ravenna, Essegi Ed., 1984, in Italian)\\nRolf Lauter, Alighiero e Boetti: Mettere il mondo al mondo (Hatje Cantz Verlag, 1988, in German, catalogue for the exhibition Mettere al mondo il mondo)\\nGermano Celant, Umberto Allemandi, et al., Arte povera (Turin, 1989, in Italian)\\nCollaboration Parkett No. 24 (art magazine, Parkett Verlag Zurich, Switzerland, 1990, in German and English)\\nAnnelie Pohlen, Alighiero e Boetti – 1965 bis 1991 (Bonner Kunstverein, 1992, in German)\\nJean-Christophe Ammann, M.

       "  'Georgia Totto O\\'Keeffe (November 15, 1887 –  March 6, 1986) was an American modernist painter and draftswoman whose career spanned seven decades and whose work remained largely independent of major art movements. Called the \"Mother of American modernism\", O\\'Keeffe gained international recognition for her meticulous paintings of natural forms, particularly flowers and desert-inspired landscapes, which were often drawn from and related to places and environments in which she lived.\\nFrom 1905, when O\\'Keeffe began her studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, until about 1920, she studied art or earned money as a commercial illustrator or a teacher to pay for further education. Influenced by Arthur Wesley Dow, O\\'Keeffe began to develop her unique style beginning with her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1917. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.\\nShe moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz\\'s request and began working seriously as an artist. They developed a professional and personal relationship that led to their marriage on December 11, 1924. O\\'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including close-ups of flowers, such as the Red Canna paintings, that many found to represent vulvas, though O\\'Keeffe consistently denied that intention. The imputation of the depiction of women\\'s sexuality was also fueled by explicit and sensuous photographs of O\\'Keeffe that Stieglitz had taken and exhibited.\\nO\\'Keeffe and Stieglitz lived together in New York until 1929, when O\\'Keeffe began spending part of the year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of New Mexico landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as Cow\\'s Skull: Red, White, and Blue (1931) and Summer Days (1936). After Stieglitz\\'s death in 1946, she lived in New Mexico for the next 40 years at her home and studio or Ghost Ranch summer home in Abiquiú, and in the last years of her life, in Santa Fe. In 2014, O\\'Keeffe\\'s 1932 painting Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1 sold for $44,405,000—at the time, by far the largest price paid for any painting by a female artist. Her works are in the collections of several museums, and following her death, the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum was established in Santa Fe.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education (1887–1916) ==\\n\\nGeorgia O\\'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O\\'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O\\'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her mother\\'s father, George Victor Totto, for whom O\\'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848.\\nO\\'Keeffe was the second of seven children. She attended Town Hall School in Sun Prairie. By age 10, she had decided to become an artist. With her sisters, Ida and Anita, she received art instruction from local watercolorist Sara Mann. O\\'Keeffe attended high school at Sacred Heart Academy in Madison, Wisconsin, as a boarder between 1901 and 1902. In late 1902, the O\\'Keeffes moved from Wisconsin to the close-knit neighborhood of Peacock Hill in Williamsburg, Virginia, where O\\'Keeffe\\'s father started a business making rusticated cast concrete block in anticipation of a demand for the block in the Virginia Peninsula building trade, but the demand never materialized. O\\'Keeffe stayed in Wisconsin attending Madison Central High School until joining her family in Virginia in 1903. She completed high school as a boarder at Chatham Episcopal Institute in Virginia (now Chatham Hall), graduating in 1905. At Chatham, she was a member of Kappa Delta sorority.\\nO\\'Keeffe taught and headed the art department at West Texas State Normal College, watching over her youngest sibling, Claudia, at her mother\\'s request. In 1917, she visited her brother, Alexis, at a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during World War I. While there, she created the painting The Flag, which expressed her anxiety and depression about the war.\\n\\n\\tEarly works\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Academic training ===\\n\\nFrom 1905 to 1906, O\\'Keeffe was enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied with John Vanderpoel and ranked at the top of her class. As a result of contracting typhoid fever, she had to take a year off from her education. In 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York City, where she studied under William Merritt Chase, Kenyon Cox, and F. Luis Mora. In 1908, she won the League\\'s William Merritt Chase still-life prize for her oil painting Dead Rabbit with Copper Pot. Her prize was a scholarship to attend the League\\'s outdoor summer school in Lake George, New York. While in the New York City, O\\'Keeffe visited galleries, such as 291, co-owned by her future husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz. The gallery promoted the work of avant-garde artists and photographers from the United States and Europe.\\nIn 1908, O\\'Keeffe discovered that she would not be able to finance her studies. Her father had gone bankrupt and her mother was seriously ill with tuberculosis. She was not interested in a career as a painter based on the mimetic tradition that had formed the basis of her art training. She took a job in Chicago as a commercial artist and worked there until 1910, when she returned to Virginia to recuperate from the measles and later moved with her family to Charlottesville, Virginia. She did not paint for four years and said that the smell of turpentine made her ill. She began teaching art in 1911. One of her positions was at her former school, Chatham Episcopal Institute, in Virginia.\\n\\n\\n=== First abstractions ===\\nShe took a summer art class in 1912 at the University of Virginia from Alon Bement, who was a Columbia University Teachers College faculty member. Under Bement, she learned of the innovative ideas of Arthur Wesley Dow, Bement\\'s colleague. Dow\\'s approach was influenced by principles of design and composition in Japanese art. She began to experiment with abstract compositions and develop a personal style that veered away from realism. From 1912 to 1914, she taught art in the public schools in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle, and was a teaching assistant to Bement during the summers. She took classes at the University of Virginia for two more summers. She also took a class in the spring of 1914 at Teachers College of Columbia University with Dow, who further influenced her thinking about the process of making art. Her studies at the University of Virginia, based upon Dow\\'s principles, were pivotal in O\\'Keeffe\\'s development as an artist. Through her exploration and growth as an artist, she helped to establish the American modernism movement.\\n\\n\\tFirst abstractions\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nShe taught at Columbia College in Columbia, South Carolina in late 1915, where she completed a series of highly innovative charcoal abstractions based on her personal sensations. In early 1916, O\\'Keeffe was in New York at Teachers College, Columbia University. She mailed the charcoal drawings to a friend and former classmate at Teachers College, Anita Pollitzer, who took them to Alfred Stieglitz at his 291 gallery early in 1916. Stieglitz found them to be the \"purest, finest, sincerest things that had entered 291 in a long while\" and said that he would like to show them. In April that year, Stieglitz exhibited ten of her drawings at 291.\\nAfter further course work at Columbia in early 1916 and summer teaching for Bement, she became the chair of the art department at West Texas State Normal College, in Canyon, Texas, beginning in the fall of 1916. O\\'Keeffe, who enjoyed sunrises and sunsets, developed a fondness for intense and nocturnal colors. Building upon a practice she began in South Carolina, O\\'Keeffe painted to express her most private sensations and feelings. Rather than sketching out a design before painting, she freely created designs. O\\'Keeffe continued to experiment until she believed she truly captured her feelings in the watercolor, Light Coming on the Plains No. I (1917).\\n\\n\\tAbstractions\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nShe began a series of watercolor paintings based upon the scenery and expansive views during her walks, including vibrant paintings of Palo Duro Canyon. She \"captured a monumental landscape in this simple configuration, fusing blue and green pigments in almost indistinct tonal graduations that simulate the pulsating effect of light on the horizon of the Texas Panhandle,\" according to author Sharyn Rohlfsen Udall.\\n\\n\\tPalo Duro Canyon\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== New York (1918–1930s) ==\\n\\n\\n=== Stieglitz circle ===\\nIn 1918, O\\'Keeffe moved to New York as Stieglitz offered to provide financial support, a residence, and place for her to paint. They developed a close personal relationship, and later married, while he promoted her work. Stieglitz also discouraged her use of watercolor, which was associated with amateur women artists. According to art historian Charles Eldredge, \"the couple enjoyed a prominent position in the ebullient art of New York throughout the 1920s\".\\nO\\'Keeffe came to know the many early American modernists who were part of Stieglitz\\'s circle of artists, including painters Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and photographers Paul Strand and Edward Steichen. Strand\\'s photography, as well as that of Stieglitz, inspired O\\'Keeffe\\'s work. Stieglitz, whose 291 Gallery closed down in 1917, was now able to spend more time on his own photographic practice, producing a series of photographs of natural forms, cloud studies (a series known as Equivalents), and portraits of O\\'Keeffe. Prior to her marriage to Stieglitz, O\\'Keeffe\\'s drawings and paintings were frequently abstract, although she began to expand her visual vocabulary from 1924 onward to include more representational imagery \"usually taken from nature and often painted in series\".\\n\\n\\n=== Flower paintings ===\\n\\nO\\'Keeffe began creating simplified images of natural things, such as leaves, flowers, and rocks. Inspired by Precisionism, The Green Apple, completed in 1922, depicts her notion of simple, meaningful life. O\\'Keeffe said that year, \"it is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things.\" Blue and Green Music expresses O\\'Keeffe\\'s feelings about music through visual art, using bold and subtle colors.\\n\\nAlso in 1922, journalist Paul Rosenfeld commented \"[the] Essence of very womanhood permeates her pictures\", citing her use of color and shapes as metaphors for the female body. This same article also describes her paintings in a sexual manner. O\\'Keeffe, most famous for her depiction of flowers, made about 200 flower paintings, which by the mid-1920s were large-scale depictions of flowers, as if seen through a magnifying lens, such as Oriental Poppies and several Red Canna paintings. She painted her first large-scale flower painting, Petunia, No. 2, in 1924 and it was first exhibited in 1925. Making magnified depictions of objects created a sense of awe and emotional intensity. In 1924, Stieglitz arranged a show displaying O\\'Keeffe\\'s works of art alongside his photographs at Anderson Galleries and helped organized other exhibitions over the next several years.\\n\\tRed Canna (1915–1923)\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== New York Skyscraper paintings ===\\n\\nAfter having moved into a 30th floor apartment in the Shelton Hotel in 1925, O\\'Keeffe began a series of paintings of the New York skyscrapers and skyline. One of her most notable works, which demonstrates her skill at depicting the buildings in the Precisionist style, is the Radiator Building–Night, New York. Other examples are New York Street with Moon (1925), The Shelton with Sunspots, N.Y. (1926), and City Night (1926). She made a cityscape, East River from the Thirtieth Story of the Shelton Hotel in 1928, a painting of her view of the East River and smoke-emitting factories in Queens. The next year she made her final New York City skyline and skyscraper paintings and traveled to New Mexico, which became a source of inspiration for her work.\\nThe Brooklyn Museum held a retrospective of her work in 1927. In 1928, Stieglitz announced that six of her calla lily paintings sold to an anonymous buyer in France for US$25,000, but there is no evidence that this transaction occurred the way Stieglitz reported. As a result of the press attention, O\\'Keeffe\\'s paintings sold at a higher price from that point onward.\\n\\n\\n== New Mexico (1930s–1986) ==\\nBy 1929, she traveled to Santa Fe for the first time, accompanied by her friend Rebecca (Beck) Strand and stayed in Taos with Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided the women with studios. From her room she had a clear view of the Taos Mountains as well as the morada (meetinghouse) of the Hermanos de la Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno, also known as the Penitentes. She subsequently visited New Mexico on near annual basis from 1929 onward, often staying there several months at a time, returning to New York each winter to exhibit her work at Stieglitz\\'s gallery. O\\'Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, The Lawrence Tree, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O\\'Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asís Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it silhouetted against the sky captured it from a unique perspective.\\nIn New Mexico, she collected rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O\\'Keeffe often explored the land she loved in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained, \"Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the \\'Faraway\\'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again.\" O\\'Keeffe did not work from late 1932 until about the mid-1930s due to nervous breakdowns.  She was a popular artist, receiving commissions while her works were being exhibited in New York and other places.\\n\\n\\n=== Skull and desert motifs ===\\nIn 1933 and 1934, O\\'Keeffe recuperated in Bermuda and returned to New Mexico in 1934. In August 1934, she moved to Ghost Ranch, north of Abiquiú. In 1940, she moved into a house on the ranch property. The varicolored cliffs surrounding the ranch inspired some of her most famous landscapes.  Between 1934 and 1936, she completed a series of landscape paintings inspired by the New Mexico desert, often with prominent depictions of animal skulls, including Rams Head with Hollyhock (1935) and Deer\\'s Head with Pedernal (1936) as well as Summer Days (1936). In 1936, she completed what would become one of her best-known paintings, Summer Days. It depicts a desert scene with a deer skull with vibrant wildflowers. Resembling Ram\\'s Head with Hollyhock, it depicted the skull floating above the horizon.\\n\\n\\tSkulls and desert motif\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n \\nIn 1938, the advertising agency N. W. Ayer & Son approached O\\'Keeffe about creating two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company) to use in advertising.  Other artists who produced paintings of Hawaii for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company\\'s advertising include Lloyd Sexton, Jr., Millard Sheets, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Isamu Noguchi, and Miguel Covarrubias. The offer came at a critical time in O\\'Keeffe\\'s life: she was 51, and her career seemed to be stalling (critics were calling her focus on New Mexico limited, and branding her desert images \"a kind of mass production\").\\nShe arrived in Honolulu February 8, 1939, aboard the SS Lurline and spent nine weeks in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the island of Hawaii. By far the most productive and vivid period was on Maui, where she was given complete freedom to explore and paint. She painted flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks. Back in New York, O\\'Keeffe completed a series of 20 sensual, verdant paintings. However, she did not paint the requested pineapple until the Hawaiian Pineapple Company sent a plant to her New York studio.\\nDuring the 1940s, O\\'Keeffe had two one-woman retrospectives, the first at the Art Institute of Chicago (1943). Her second was in 1946, when she was the first woman artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan.  Whitney Museum began an effort to create the first catalogue of her work in the mid-1940s.\\n\\n\\n=== Abiquiú and landscapes ===\\nIn 1945, O\\'Keeffe bought a second house, an abandoned hacienda in Abiquiú, which she renovated into a home and studio. She moved permanently to New Mexico in 1949, spending time at both Ghost Ranch and the Abiquiú house that she made into her studio.\\nTodd Webb, a photographer she met in the 1940s, moved to New Mexico in 1961. He often made photographs of her, as did numerous other important American photographers, who consistently presented O\\'Keeffe as a \"loner, a severe figure and self-made person.\" While O\\'Keeffe was known to have a \"prickly personality,\" Webb\\'s photographs portray her with a kind of \"quietness and calm\" suggesting a relaxed friendship, and revealing new contours of O\\'Keeffe\\'s character.\\nIn the 1940s, O\\'Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the \"Black Place\", about 150 miles (240 km) west of her Ghost Ranch house. O\\'Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled \"a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet.\" She made paintings of the \"White Place\", a white rock formation located near her Abiquiú house. In 1946, she began making the architectural forms of her Abiquiú house—the patio wall and door—subjects in her work. Another distinctive painting was Ladder to the Moon, 1958. In the mid-1960s, O\\'Keeffe produced Sky Above Clouds, a series of cloudscapes inspired by her views from airplane windows. Worcester Art Museum held a retrospective of her work in 1960 and ten years later, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Retrospective Exhibition.\\n\\n\\n=== Late career and death ===\\n\\nBy 1972, O\\'Keeffe had lost much of her eyesight due to macular degeneration, leaving her with only peripheral vision. She stopped oil painting without assistance in 1972. In 1973, O\\'Keeffe hired John Bruce \"Juan\" Hamilton as a live-in assistant and then a caretaker. Hamilton was a potter. Hamilton taught O\\'Keeffe to work with clay, encouraged her to resume painting despite her deteriorating eyesight, and helped her write her autobiography. He worked for her for 13 years. The artist\\'s autobiography, Georgia O\\'Keeffe, published in 1976 by Viking Press, featured Summer Days (1936) on the cover. It became a bestseller. During the 1970s, she made a series of works in watercolor. She continued working in pencil and charcoal until 1984.\\nO\\'Keeffe became increasingly frail in her late nineties. She moved to Santa Fe in 1984, where she died on March 6, 1986, at the age of 98. Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered, as she wished, on the land around Ghost Ranch. Following O\\'Keeffe\\'s death, her family contested her will because codicils added to it in the 1980s had left most of her $65 million estate to Hamilton. The case was ultimately settled out of court in July 1987. The case became a famous precedent in estate planning.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\n\\n\\n=== Awards and honors ===\\n\\nIn 1938, O\\'Keeffe received an honorary degree of \"Doctor of Fine Arts\" from the College of William & Mary.  Later, O\\'Keeffe was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 1966 was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among her awards and honors, O\\'Keeffe received the M. Carey Thomas Award at Bryn Mawr College in 1971 and two years later received an honorary degree from Harvard University.\\nIn 1977, President Gerald Ford presented O\\'Keeffe with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor awarded to American civilians. In 1985, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Ronald Reagan. In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women\\'s Hall of Fame.\\n\\n\\n=== Art criticism and scholarship ===\\nO\\'Keeffe\\'s lotus paintings may have deeper ties to vulvar imagery and symbolism. In Egyptian mythology, lotus flowers are a symbol of the womb, and in Indian mythology, they are direct symbols for vulvas. Feminist art historian Linda Nochlin and the author of the influential 1971 essay titled \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\", also interpreted Black Iris III (1926) as a morphological metaphor for a vulva.\\nArt dealer Samuel Kootz was one of O\\'Keeffe\\'s critics who, although considering her to be \"the only prominent woman artist\" (in the words of Marilyn Hall Mitchell), considered sexual expression in her work (and other artists\\' work) artistically problematic. Kootz stated that \"assertion of sex can only impede the talents of an artist, for it is an act of defiance, of grievance, in which the consciousness of these qualities retards the natural assertions of the painter\".\\nO\\'Keeffe stood her ground against sexual interpretations of her work, and for fifty years maintained that there was no connection between vulvas and her artwork. Firing back against some of the criticism, O\\'Keeffe stated, \"When people read erotic symbols into my paintings, they\\'re really talking about their own affairs.\" She attributed other artists\\' attacks on her work to psychological projection. O\\'Keeffe was also seen as a revolutionary feminist; however, the artist rejected these notions, stating that \"femaleness is irrelevant\" and that \"it has nothing to do with art making or accomplishment.\"\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nIn June 1918, O\\'Keeffe accepted Stieglitz\\'s invitation to move to New York from Texas after he promised he would provide her with a quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took the first of many nude photographs of her at his family\\'s apartment while his wife was away. His wife returned home once while their session was still in progress. She had suspected for a while that something was going on between the two, and told him to stop seeing O\\'Keeffe or get out. Stieglitz left home immediately and found a place in the city where he and O\\'Keeffe could live together. They slept separately for more than two weeks. By the end of the month they were in the same bed together, and by mid-August when they visited Oaklawn, the Stieglitz family summer estate in Lake George in upstate New York, \"they were like two teenagers in love. Several times a day they would run up the stairs to their bedroom, so eager to make love that they would start taking their clothes off as they ran.\" Also around this time, O\\'Keeffe became sick during the 1918 flu pandemic.\\nIn February 1921, Stieglitz\\'s photographs of O\\'Keeffe were included in a retrospective exhibition at the Anderson Galleries. Stieglitz started photographing O\\'Keeffe when she visited him in New York City to see her 1917 exhibition, and continued taking photographs, many of which were in the nude. It created a public sensation. When he retired from photography in 1937, he had made more than 350 portraits and more than 200 nude photos of her. In 1978, she wrote about how distant from them she had become, \"When I look over the photographs Stieglitz took of me—some of them more than sixty years ago—I wonder who that person is. It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives.\"\\n\\nOwing to the legal delays caused by Stieglitz\\'s first wife and her family, it would take six years before he obtained a divorce. O\\'Keeffe and Stieglitz were married on December 11, 1924. For the rest of their lives together, their relationship was, \"a collusion....a system of deals and trade-offs, tacitly agreed to and carried out, for the most part, without the exchange of a word. Preferring avoidance to confrontation on most issues, O\\'Keeffe was the principal agent of collusion in their union,\" according to biographer Benita Eisler. They lived primarily in New York City, but spent their summers at his father\\'s family estate, Oaklawn, in Lake George in upstate New York.\\n\\nO\\'Keeffe and Stieglitz had an open relationship, which could be painful for O\\'Keeffe when Stieglitz had affairs with women. In 1928, Stieglitz began a long-term affair with Dorothy Norman, who was also married, and O\\'Keeffe lost a project to create a mural for Radio City Music Hall. She was hospitalized for depression. At the suggestion of Maria Chabot and Mabel Dodge Luhan, O\\'Keeffe began to spend the summers painting in New Mexico in 1929. She traveled by train with her friend the painter Rebecca Strand, Paul Strand\\'s wife, to Taos, where they lived with their patron who provided them with studios. In 1933, O\\'Keeffe was hospitalized for two months after suffering a nervous breakdown, largely due to Stieglitz\\'s affair with Dorothy Norman. She did not paint again until January 1934.\\nO\\'Keeffe continued to visit New Mexico, without her husband, and created a new body of works based upon the desert. O\\'Keeffe broke free of \"strict gender roles\" and adopted \"gender neutral\" clothing, as did other professional women in Santa Fe and Taos who experienced \"psychological space and sexual freedom\" there.\\nShortly after O\\'Keeffe arrived for the summer in New Mexico in 1946, Stieglitz suffered a cerebral thrombosis (stroke). She immediately flew to New York to be with him. He died on July 13, 1946. She buried his ashes at Lake George. She spent the next three years mostly in New York settling his estate.\\nShe had a close relationship with Beck Strand. They enjoyed spending time together, traveling, and living with \"glee\". Strand said that she was most herself when with O\\'Keeffe. In Foursome—a book about O\\'Keeffe, Stieglitz, and Beck and Paul Strand—Carolyn Burke argues against the notion that the women were sexually or romantically involved, finding such a reading of their correspondence incongruous with their \"passionate ties to their husbands\" and \"strong heterosexual attractions\".\\nFrida Kahlo met O\\'Keeffe in December 1931 in New York City at the opening of Diego Rivera\\'s solo exhibition at the MOMA, after which a friendship developed. They remained friends, staying in touch when O\\'Keeffe recuperated from a nervous breakdown in a hospital and then in Bermuda. Both women visited each other\\'s homes on a couple of occasions in the 1950s.\\nAmong guests to visit her at the ranch over the years were Charles and Anne Lindbergh, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, poet Allen Ginsberg, and photographer Ansel Adams. She traveled and camped at \"Black Place\" often with her friend, Maria Chabot, and later with Eliot Porter.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nMarquette Middle School in Madison, Wisconsin was renamed as Georgia O\\'Keeffe Middle School.\\nIn 2020, Tymberwood Academy (in Gravesend, Kent, England), pupils chose new class names. One of the winning names for a Year 3 class was Georgia O\\'Keeffe.\\n\\n\\n=== Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum ===\\n\\nO\\'Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, \"The most remarkable thing about O\\'Keeffe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.\" At that time, even in Europe, there were few artists exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style.\\nA substantial part of her estate\\'s assets were transferred to the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiú house, library, and property. The Georgia O\\'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiú was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998, and is now owned by the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum. A fossilized species of archosaur was named Effigia okeeffeae (\"O\\'Keeffe\\'s Ghost\") in January 2006, \"in honor of Georgia O\\'Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the Coelophysis Quarry when it was discovered\". In November 2016, the Georgia O\\'Keeffe Museum recognized the importance of her time in Charlottesville by dedicating an exhibition, using watercolors that she had created over three summers. It was entitled, O\\'Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912–1914.\\n\\n\\n=== Popular culture ===\\nIn 1991, PBS aired the American Playhouse production A Marriage: Georgia O\\'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz, starring Jane Alexander as O\\'Keeffe and Christopher Plummer as Alfred Stieglitz. In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp honoring O\\'Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O\\'Keeffe\\'s Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie\\'s II, 1930 as part of their Modern Art in America series.  Lifetime Television produced a biopic of Georgia O\\'Keeffe starring Joan Allen as O\\'Keeffe, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Stieglitz, Henry Simmons as Jean Toomer, Ed Begley Jr. as Stieglitz\\'s brother Lee, and Tyne Daly as Mabel Dodge Luhan. It premiered on September 19, 2009.\\nOn November 20, 2014, O\\'Keeffe\\'s Jimson Weed/White Flower No 1 (1932) sold for $44,405,000 in 2014 at auction to Walmart heiress Alice Walton, more than three times the previous world auction record for any female artist.\\n\\n\\n=== Women\\'s suffrage and feminism ===\\nIn Equal Under the Sky: Georgia O\\'Keeffe and Twentieth Century Feminism, Linda M. Grasso documents O\\'Keeffe\\'s life-long involvement in feminism and women\\'s issues. O\\'Keeffe came of age as a woman and an artist in the 1910s, at the height of the women\\'s suffrage movement and the intense artistic ferment of modernism. Grasso notes that \"Modernists championed rupture, innovation, and daring in art forms, styles, and perspectives,\" and that O\\'Keeffe \"first created herself as an artist when feminism and modernism were interlinked\". As early as 1915, O\\'Keeffe was reading books and articles on women\\'s suffrage and cultural politics with enthusiasm, such as Floyd Dell\\'s Women as World Builders: Studies in Modern Feminism. There was much talk in this era about the \"New Woman,\" liberated from Victorian strictures and mores and pursuing her own life and education and self-expression freely. O\\'Keeffe was in active dialogue with her suffragist friend Anita Pollitzer, with whom she exchanged letters on the subject. Pollitzer, in fact, was the first person to introduce Alfred Stieglitz to O\\'Keeffe\\'s art work. She was also reading Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Olive Schreiner, among others, alongside the radical magazine The Masses, and lecturing on modernist dancer Isadora Duncan. In a debate with Michael Gold in 1930, O\\'Keeffe said she was \"interested in the oppression of women of all classes\". Gross writes: \"She sustained an affiliation with the National Woman\\'s Party and made public statements about gender discrimination and women\\'s rights in interviews, speeches, letters, and articles into the 1970s.\"\\nShe received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest-paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life.\\nMary Beth Edelson\\'s Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci\\'s The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. John the Apostle\\'s head was replaced with Nancy Graves, and Christ\\'s with Georgia O\\'Keeffe. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\" Judy Chicago gave O\\'Keeffe a prominent place in her The Dinner Party (1979) in recognition of what many prominent feminist artists considered groundbreaking introduction of sensual and feminist imagery in her works of art. Although feminists celebrated O\\'Keeffe as the originator of \"female iconography\", she did not consider herself a feminist. She disliked being called a \"woman artist\" and wanted to be considered an \"artist.\"\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nO\\'Keeffe, Georgia (1976). Georgia O\\'Keeffe. New York: Viking Press.

       "  'Hans-Peter Feldmann (17 January 1941 – 24 May 2023) was a German visual artist. Feldmann\\'s approach to art-making was one of collecting, ordering, and re-presenting.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nFeldmann was born on 17 January 1941. In the 1960s, Feldmann studied painting at the University of Arts and Industrial Design Linz in Austria. He began working in 1968, producing the first of the small handmade books that would become a signature part of his work. These modest books, simply entitled Bilde (Picture) or Bilder (Pictures), would include one or more reproductions from a certain type—knees of women, shoes, chairs, film stars, etc.--their subjects isolated in their ubiquity and presented without captions. In 1979 Feldmann decided to pull out of the art world and just make books and pictures for himself. In 1989 the curator Kasper König persuaded Feldmann to exhibit in a gallery again.\\nFeldmann died on 24 May 2023, at the age of 82.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nFeldmann was a figure in the conceptual art movement and practitioner in the artist book and multiple formats. Feldmann\\'s approach to art-making was one of collecting, ordering, and re-presenting amateur snapshots, print photographic reproductions, toys, and trivial works of art. Feldmann reproduced and recontextualized our reading of them in books, postcards, posters or multiples.\\nFeldmann made his first series of books between 1968 and 1971. His works from the early 1970s include 70 snapshots depicting All the Clothes of a Woman and four Time Series projects including, for example, a row of 36 pictures of a ship moving along a river. Feldmann\\'s series Photographs Taken From Hotel Room Windows While Traveling clusters 108 nondescript, unframed snapshots of buildings, streets, and parking lots (like other Feldmann projects, this calls to mind Ed Ruscha\\'s photographic catalogs). 11 Left Shoes presents 11 shoes borrowed from \"303 Gallery\"  employees, in a row on the floor. Que Sera has the words of the song of that title handwritten on the wall. Bed With Photograph simulates part of a hotel room with a slept-in bed, a side table, and a framed photograph of a woman in leopard-print pants.\\nFeldmann\\'s photographic essays might have a more intimate singularity in book form. His book Secret Picturebook (1973) is a thick, densely printed, scholarly tome with little pictures of women\\'s torsos in sexy underwear inserted at intervals. It most pointedly embodies the artist\\'s mischievous relationship to high culture. Another book, “1967-1993 Die Toten” reproduces images from newspapers of all of the lives lost due to the violence and terrorism that permeated that period of contemporary German history.\\nCreating carefully conceived installations from everyday images is what Feldmann is best known for. In 2004–2005 MoMA P.S. 1 showed “100 Years,” an exhibition of work by Feldmann composed of 101 photographic portraits of people ages 8 months to 100 years. And at the International Center of Photography in 2008 he filled a room with the framed front pages of 100 newspapers — from New York, Paris, Dubai, Sydney, Seoul and elsewhere — printed on 12 September 2001.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nFeldmann was named winner of the eighth Biennal Hugo Boss Prize in 2010. This prize included an exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in May 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nFeldmann\\'s work features in prominent private and public collections, such as that of the Fotomuseum Winterthur and the MACBA in Barcelona. In 2012, the artist donated one of his key works, Die Toten (The Dead), to the Berlin State Museums in Berlin.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nFeldmann was represented by Mehdi Chouakri Gallery in Berlin, Simon Lee Gallery in London, Galerie Francesca Pia in Zürich, Galerie Martine Aboucaya in Paris, and the 303 Gallery in New York. He did not limit the number of editions of his works, nor did he sign them.\\n\\n\\n== Publications (selected) ==\\nEine Stadt. Essen. Ausst.-Kat.

       "  \"Thomas Nozkowski (March 23, 1944 – May 9, 2019) was an American contemporary painter. He achieved a place of prominence through his small scale paintings and drawings that push the limits of visual language.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNozkowski was born in Teaneck, New Jersey and raised in Dumont, where he graduated from Dumont High School in 1961. He spent his youth in the New Jersey suburbs, admiring New York culture from afar before moving there after graduating high school. His father worked in an Alcoa Aluminum factory and then as a postman. His mother worked in factories and as a bookkeeper. One of his aunts was a schoolteacher who gave him and his younger sister art supplies. When he was a senior in high school he won a scholarship to attend a painting class at New York University's School of Education, where he studied with Robert Kaupelis and Hale Woodruff. While he earned his BFA at Cooper Union, Nozkowski was making sculptures. He graduated in 1967. He later transitioned to painting, and exhibited some of his earliest works in group shows at the storied Betty Parsons Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn the early 1970s, after several years of making large scale paintings Nozkowski reacted to the macho scale of both Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism, and decided to work small, and on the easel — initially painting on 16-by-22-inch pieces of art-store canvas board.\\nBy 1979, he had found an audience for his work in New York. Through a number of solo exhibitions at 55 Mercer Gallery and Rosa Esman Gallery in the 1980s, along with The Museum of Modern Art acquiring his work in 1982, his reputation for creating evocative drawings, prints, and paintings was solidified.\\nFor more than four decades, Nozkowski painted almost every day, often in his studio in upstate New York. He had over 80 one-person shows of his work, most recently at the Pace Gallery which has represented him since 2008. Among his significant exhibitions were surveys at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1987, Ludwig Museum in 2007 and Fisher Landau Center in 2008. Nozkowski appeared in the main exhibition at the 2007 Venice Biennale curated by Rob Storr. He was the subject of a retrospective of works on paper at the New York Studio School in 2003 and a career retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada in 2009. Other exhibitions include, 70 Years of Abstract Painting - Excerpts, 2011, curated by Stephanie Buhmann at Jason McCoy Gallery, New York.\\nHis work was written about and admired by art critics including Peter Schjeldahl, Marjorie Welish, John Yau and Robert Storr.\\n\\n\\n== Achievements ==\\nNozkowski's long career includes achievements such as a 1993 Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts, a 1999 award for painting from The American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 2008, the President's Citation of Cooper Union. In 2010, Nozkowski was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\nMuseum of Fine Arts Boston,\\nBrooklyn Museum New York,\\nMorgan Library and Museum, New York\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nPhillips Collection, Washington, DC\\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",
       "  'David Hockney  (born 9 July 1937) is an English painter, draughtsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer. As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.\\nHockney has owned residences and studios in Bridlington, England; and London as well as two residences in California, where he has lived intermittently since 1964: one in the Hollywood Hills, one in Malibu. He has an office and stores his archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California.\\nOn 15 November 2018, Hockney\\'s 1972 work Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold at Christie\\'s auction house in New York City for $90 million (£70 million), becoming the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at auction. It broke the previous record which was set by the 2013 sale of Jeff Koons\\' Balloon Dog (Orange) for $58.4 million. Hockney held the record until 15 May 2019 when Koons reclaimed the honour by selling his Rabbit for more than $91 million at Christie\\'s in New York.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nDavid Hockney was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, the fourth of five children of Kenneth Hockney (1904-1978) who was an accountant\\'s clerk who later ran his own accountancy business, and who had been a conscientious objector in the Second World War, and Laura (1900-1999) née Thompson, a devout Methodist and strict vegetarian. He was educated at Wellington Primary School, Bradford Grammar School, Bradford College of Art (his teachers there included Frank Lisle and his fellow students included Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Norman Stevens, David Oxtoby, and John Loker) and the Royal College of Art in London, where he met R. B. Kitaj and Frank Bowling. While at the school Hockney said he felt at home and took pride in his work.\\nAt the Royal College of Art, Hockney featured–alongside Peter Blake–in the exhibition New Contemporaries, which announced the arrival of British Pop art. He was associated with the movement, but his early works display expressionist elements which are similar to some of Francis Bacon\\'s works. \\nWhen the RCA said it would not let him graduate if he did not complete an assignment of a life drawing of a live model in 1962, Hockney painted Life Painting for a Diploma in protest. He had refused to write an essay required for the final examination and said that he should be assessed solely on his artworks. Recognising his talent and growing reputation, the RCA changed its regulations and awarded him a diploma. After leaving the RCA, he taught at Maidstone College of Art for a short time. He taught at the University of Iowa in 1964. Hockney also taught at the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1965. Next he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles  from 1966 to 1967 and then at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn 1964, Hockney moved to Los Angeles, where he was inspired to make a series of paintings of swimming pools in the comparatively new acrylic medium using vibrant colours. He lived at various times in Los Angeles, London, and Paris from the late 1960s to 1970s. In 1974 he began a decade-long personal relationship with Gregory Evans who moved with him to the US in 1976 and as of 2019 remains a business partner. \\nIn 1978 he rented a home in the Hollywood Hills; he later bought and expanded the house to include his studio. He also owned a 1,643-square-foot beach house at 21039 Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, which he sold in 1999 for about $1.5 million. In the 1990s, Hockney returned more often to Yorkshire, usually every three months, to visit his mother who died in 1999. Until 1997, he rarely stayed for more than two weeks, when his friend Jonathan Silver who was terminally ill, encouraged him to capture the local surroundings. At first he did this with paintings based on memory, some from his boyhood. In 1998, he completed his painting of the Yorkshire landmark, Garrowby Hill. Hockney returned to Yorkshire for increasingly longer stays and by 2003 was painting the countryside en plein air in both oils and watercolour. \\nHe set up residence and studio in a converted bed and breakfast, in the seaside town of Bridlington, about 75 mi (121 km) from where he was born. The oil paintings he produced after 2005 were influenced by his intensive studies in watercolour, a series titled Midsummer: East Yorkshire (2003–2004). He created paintings made of multiple smaller canvases—two to fifty—placed together. To help him visualise work at that scale, he used digital photographic reproductions to study the day\\'s work. In spring 2020 he stayed at La Grande Cour, a farmhouse and studio in Normandy, during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since that date he has settled full-time in Normandy.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nHockney has experimented with painting, drawing, printmaking, watercolours, photography, and many other media including a fax machine, paper pulp, computer applications and iPad drawing programs. The subject matter of interest ranges from still lifes to landscapes, portraits of friends, his dogs, and stage designs for the Royal Court Theatre, Glyndebourne, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Portraits ===\\n\\nHockney has returned to painting portraits throughout his career. From 1968, and for the next few years, he painted portraits and double portraits of friends, lovers, and relatives just under life-size in a realistic style that adroitly captured the likenesses of his subjects. Hockney has repeatedly been drawn to the same subjects – his family, employees, artists Mo McDermott and Maurice Payne, various writers he has known, fashion designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark (Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy, 1970–71), curator Henry Geldzahler, art dealer Nicholas Wilder, George Lawson and his ballet dancer lover, Wayne Sleep, and also his romantic interests throughout the years, including Peter Schlesinger and Gregory Evans. Perhaps more than all of these, Hockney has turned to his own figure year after year, creating over 300 self-portraits.\\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Hockney used a camera lucida for his research into art history as well as his own work in the studio. He created over 200 drawings of friends, family, and himself using this antique lens-based device.\\nIn 2016, the Royal Academy exhibited Hockney\\'s series entitled 82 Portraits and 1 Still-life which traveled to Ca\\' Pesaro in Venice, Italy, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in 2017 and to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2018. Hockney calls the paintings started in 2013 \"twenty-hour exposures\" because each sitting took six to seven hours on three consecutive days.\\n\\n\\n=== Printmaking ===\\nHockney experimented with printmaking as early as a lithograph Self-Portrait in 1954 and worked in etchings during his time at RCA. In 1965, the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. approached him to create a series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme. Hockney responded by creating The Hollywood Collection, a series of lithographs recreating the art collection of a Hollywood star, each piece depicting an imagined work of art within a frame. Hockney went on to produce many other portfolios with Gemini G.E.L. including Friends, The Weather Series, and Some New Prints. During the 1960s he produced several series of prints he thought of as \\'graphic tales\\', including A Rake\\'s Progress (1961–63) after Hogarth, Illustrations for Fourteen Poems from C.P. Cavafy (1966) and Illustrations for Six Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm (1969).\\nIn 1973 Hockney began a fruitful collaboration with Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso\\'s preferred printer. In his atelier, he adopted Crommelynck\\'s trademark sugar lift, as well as a system of the master\\'s own devising of imposing a wooden frame onto the plate to ensure colour separation. Their early work together included Artist and Model (1973–74) and Contrejour in the French Style (1974). In 1976–77 Hockney created The Blue Guitar, a suite of 20 etchings, each utilising Crommelynck\\'s techniques and filled with references to Picasso. The frontispiece to the suite mentions Hockney\\'s dual inspiration; \"The Blue Guitar: Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Pablo Picasso\". The etchings refer to themes in a poem by Wallace Stevens, The Man with the Blue Guitar. It was published by Petersburg Press in October 1977. That year, Petersburg also published a book in which the images were accompanied by the poem\\'s text.\\nIn the summer of 1978, David Hockney stayed for six weeks with his friend the printer Ken Tyler at Tyler\\'s studio in New York, Tyler Graphics Ltd. Tyler invited Hockney to try a new technique with liquid paper. The process is painting with the paper itself, so the artist had to do it himself by hand. Each image becomes a unique work between printmaking and painting. In six weeks, Hockney created a total of 29 artworks with a series of 17 sunflowers and swimming pools. Many of the works are very similar, differentiated by changes in colour choice and application of the colour. Some are solely coloured using paper pulp, while some use spray paint to achieve certain details.\\nSome of Hockney\\'s other print portfolios include Home Made Prints (1986), Recent Etchings (1998) and Moving Focus (1984–1986), which contains lithographs related to A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard, Acatlan. A retrospective of his prints, including \\'computer drawings\\' printed on fax machines and inkjet printers, was exhibited at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London 5 February – 11 May 2014 and Bowes Museum, County Durham 7 June – 28 September 2014, with an accompanying publication, Hockney, Printmaker, by Richard Lloyd.\\n\\n\\n=== Photocollages ===\\nIn the early 1980s, Hockney began to produce photo collages—which, in his early explorations within his personal photo albums, he referred to as \"joiners\"—first using Polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm, commercially processed colour prints. Using Polaroid snaps or photolab-prints of a single subject, Hockney arranged a patchwork to make a composite image. Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of Hockney\\'s major aims—discussing the way human vision works. Some pieces are landscapes, such as Pearblossom Highway #2, others portraits including Kasmin 1982; and My Mother, Bolton Abbey, 1982.\\nCreation of the \"joiners\" occurred accidentally. He noticed in the late 1960s that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery, stopping painting for a while to pursue this new technique exclusively.\\nHowever over time, he discovered what he could not capture with a lens, saying: \"Photography seems to be rather good at portraiture, or can be. But, it can\\'t tell you about space, which is the essence of landscape. For me anyway. Even Ansel Adams can\\'t quite prepare you for what Yosemite looks like when you go through that tunnel and you come out the other side.\" Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its \\'one-eyed\\' approach, he returned to painting.\\n\\n\\n=== Other technology ===\\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the Quantel Paintbox, a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen. The resulting work was featured in a BBC series that profiled several artists. In 1999–2001, David\\'s sister, Margaret, began experimenting with digital photography, scanning and computer printing, particularly making images of flowers scanning a small Japanese vase and fresh flowers. In 2003, she was experimenting with Photoshop, scanning summer flowers and building up images in layers which Margaret printed out on an A3 printer. In 2004, David went to stay with Margaret and she helped him scan his sketchbook of Yorkshire landscape and David soon began using a Wacom pad and pen directly into Photoshop.\\nSince 2009, Hockney has painted hundreds of portraits, still lifes and landscapes using the Brushes iPhone and iPad application, often sending them to his friends. In 2010 and 2011, Hockney visited Yosemite National Park to draw its landscape on his iPad. He used an iPad in designing a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey which celebrated the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Unveiled in September 2018, the Queen\\'s Window is located in the north transept of the Abbey and features a hawthorn blossom scene which is set in Yorkshire.\\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Hockney created multi-camera movies using three to eighteen cameras to record a single scene. He filmed the landscape of Yorkshire in various seasons, jugglers and dancers, and his own exhibitions within the de Young Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts. His earlier photo collages influenced his shift to another medium, digital photography. He combined hundreds of photographs to create multi-viewpoint \"photographic drawings\" of groups of his friends in 2014. Hockney picked the process back up in 2017, this time using the more advanced Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetric software which allowed him to stitch together and rearrange thousands of photos. The resulting images were printed out as massive photomurals and were exhibited at Pace Gallery and LACMA in 2018.\\n\\n\\n=== Plein air landscapes ===\\nIn June 2007, Hockney\\'s largest painting, Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique, which measures 15 by 40 feet (4.6 by 12.2 m), was hung in the Royal Academy\\'s largest gallery in its annual Summer Exhibition. This work \"is a monumental-scale view of a coppice in Hockney\\'s native Yorkshire, between Bridlington and York. It was painted on 50 individual canvases, mostly working in situ, over five weeks last winter.\" In 2008, he donated it to Tate in London, saying: \"I thought if I\\'m going to give something to the Tate I want to give them something really good. It\\'s going to be here for a while. I don\\'t want to give things I\\'m not too proud of... I thought this was a good painting because it\\'s of England... it seems like a good thing to do.\" The painting was the subject of a BBC1 Imagine film documentary by Bruno Wollheim called David Hockney: A Bigger Picture (2009) which followed Hockney as he worked outdoors over the preceding two years.\\n\\n\\n=== Theatre works ===\\nHockney\\'s first stage designs were for Ubu Roi at London\\'s Royal Court Theatre in 1966, Stravinsky\\'s The Rake\\'s Progress at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England in 1975, and The Magic Flute for Glyndebourne in 1978. In 1980, he agreed to design sets and costumes for a 20th-century French triple bill at the Metropolitan Opera House with the title Parade. The works were Parade, a ballet with music by Erik Satie; Les mamelles de Tirésias, an opera with libretto by Guillaume Apollinaire and music by Francis Poulenc, and L\\'enfant et les sortilèges, an opera with libretto by Colette and music by Maurice Ravel. The reimagined set of L\\'enfant et les sortilèges from the 1983 exhibition Hockney Paints the Stage is a permanent installation at the Spalding House branch of the Honolulu Museum of Art. He designed sets for another triple bill of Stravinsky\\'s Le sacre du printemps, Le rossignol, and Oedipus Rex for the Metropolitan Opera in 1981 as well as Richard Wagner\\'s Tristan und Isolde for the Los Angeles Music Center Opera in 1987, Puccini\\'s Turandot in 1991 at the Chicago Lyric Opera, and Richard Strauss\\'s Die Frau ohne Schatten in 1992 at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1994, he designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Plácido Domingo\\'s Operalia in Mexico City. Technical advances allowed him to become increasingly complex in model-making. At his studio he had a proscenium opening 6 feet (1.8 m) by 4 feet (1.2 m) in which he built sets in 1:8 scale. He also used a computerised setup that let him punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronise them to a soundtrack of the music.\\nIn 2017, Hockney was awarded the San Francisco Opera Medal on the occasion of the revival and restoration of his production for Turandot. The majority of his theatre works and stage design studies are found in the collection of The David Hockney Foundation.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nDavid Hockney has been featured in over 400 solo exhibitions and over 500 group exhibitions. He had his first one-man show at Kasmin Limited when he was 26 in 1963, and by 1970 the Whitechapel Gallery in London had organised the first of several major retrospectives, which subsequently travelled to three European institutions. LACMA also hosted a retrospective exhibition in 1988 which travelled to The Met, New York, and Tate, London. In 2004, he was included in the cross-generational Whitney Biennial, where his portraits appeared in a gallery with those of a younger artist he had inspired, Elizabeth Peyton.\\nIn October 2006, the National Portrait Gallery in London organised one of the largest ever displays of Hockney\\'s portraiture work, including 150 paintings, drawings, prints, sketchbooks, and photocollages from over five decades. The collection ranged from his earliest self-portraits to work he completed in 2005. Hockney assisted in displaying the works and the exhibition, which ran until January 2007, was one of the gallery\\'s most successful. In 2009, \"David Hockney: Just Nature\" attracted some 100,000 visitors at the Kunsthalle Würth in Schwäbisch Hall, Germany.\\n\\nFrom 21 January 2012 to 9 April 2012, the Royal Academy presented A Bigger Picture, which included more than 150 works, many of which take entire walls in the gallery\\'s brightly lit rooms. The exhibition is dedicated to landscapes, especially trees and tree tunnels of his native Yorkshire. Works included oil paintings, watercolours, and drawings created on an iPad and printed on paper. Hockney said, in a 2012 interview, \"It\\'s about big things. You can make paintings bigger. We\\'re also making photographs bigger, videos bigger, all to do with drawing.\" The exhibition drew more than 600,000 visitors in under 3 months. The exhibition moved to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain from 15 May to 30 September, and from there to the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany, between 27 October 2012 and 3 February 2013.\\nFrom 26 October 2013 to 30 January 2014 David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition was presented at the de Young Museum, one of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The largest solo exhibition Hockney has had, with 397 works of art in more than 18,000 square feet, was curated by Gregory Evans and included the only public showing of The Great Wall, developed during research for Secret Knowledge, and works from 1999 to 2013 in a variety of media from camera lucida drawings to watercolours, oil paintings, and digital works.\\nFrom 9 February to 29 May 2017 David Hockney was presented at the Tate Britain, becoming the most-visited exhibition in the gallery\\'s history. The exhibition marked Hockney\\'s 80th year and gathered together \"an extensive selection of David Hockney\\'s most famous works celebrating his achievements in painting, drawing, print, photography and video across six decades\". The show then travelled to Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The wildly popular retrospective landed among the top ten ticketed exhibitions in London and Paris for 2017 with over 4,000 visitors per day at the Tate and over 5,000 visitors per day in Paris.\\nAfter the blockbuster exhibitions in 2017 of the works of decades past, Hockney went on to display his newest paintings on hexagonal canvases and mural-size 3D photographic drawings at Pace Gallery in 2018. He revisited paintings of Garrowby Hill, the Grand Canyon, and Nichols Canyon Road, this time painting them on hexagonal canvases to enhance aspects of reverse perspective. In 2019, his early work featured in his native Yorkshire at The Hepworth Wakefield.\\nIn April–June 2022 an exhibition \"Hockney\\'s Eye: The Art and Technology of Depiction\" was held at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge and at the city\\'s Heong Gallery.  In 2023 the Honolulu Museum of Art (HoMA) presented \"David Hockney: Perspective Should Be Reversed, Prints from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation.\" The exhibition is the largest retrospective print exhibition of Hockney\\'s career, with more than 100 colourful prints, collages and photographic and iPad drawings, in a variety of media, spanning six decades of the artist\\'s career.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nHockney came out as gay when he was 23, while studying at the Royal College of Art in London. Britain decriminalised homosexual acts seven years later in the Sexual Offences Act 1967. Hockney has explored the nature of gay love in his work, such in as the painting We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), named after a poem by Walt Whitman. In 1963 he painted two men together in the painting Domestic Scene, Los Angeles, one showering while the other washes his back. In the summer of 1966, while teaching at UCLA, he met Peter Schlesinger, an art student who posed for paintings and drawings, and with whom he became romantically involved. Another of Hockney\\'s romantic partners who was the subject of his work was Gregory Evans; the two met in 1971 and began a relationship in 1974. While no longer romantically involved, they still work together, with Evans managing the David Hockney Studio. Hockney\\'s current partner is longtime companion Jean-Pierre Gonçalves de Lima. Also known as JP, he also works with Hockney in his studio as his chief assistant.\\nIn March 2013, Hockney\\'s 23-year-old assistant, Dominic Elliott, died as a result of drinking drain cleaner at Hockney\\'s Bridlington studio; he had earlier taken both drugs and alcohol. Hockney\\'s partner drove Elliott to Scarborough General Hospital where he later died. The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure. In November 2015 Hockney sold his house in Bridlington ending his connections with the town.\\nNext he moved to Normandy and now lives near the village of Beuvron-en-Auge. He holds a California Medical Marijuana Verification Card, which enables him to buy cannabis for medical purposes. He has used hearing aids since 1979, but realised he was going deaf long before then. As of 2018, he has been keeping fit by spending a half hour in the swimming pool every morning; he has been able to stand for six hours at the easel.\\nHockney has synaesthetic associations between sound, colour and shape.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMany of Hockney\\'s works are housed in the 1853 Gallery at Salts Mill in Saltaire, near his hometown of Bradford. Another large group of works are held by The David Hockney Foundation. His work is in numerous public and private collections worldwide, including:\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 1967, Hockney\\'s painting, Peter Getting Out of Nick\\'s Pool, won the John Moores Painting Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. He was offered a knighthood in 1990 but declined it, before accepting an Order of Merit in January 2012. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society\\'s Progress medal in 1988 and the Special 150th Anniversary Medal and Honorary Fellowship in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2003. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1997 and awarded The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh). He is a Royal Academician. \\nIn 2012, he was appointed to the Order of Merit, an honour restricted to 24 members at any one time for their contributions to the arts and sciences. He was a Distinguished Honoree of the National Arts Association, Los Angeles, in 1991 and received the First Annual Award of Achievement from the Archives of American Art, Los Angeles, in 1993. He was appointed to the board of trustees of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust, New York in 1992 and was given a Foreign Honorary Membership to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1997. In 2003, Hockney was awarded the Lorenzo de\\' Medici Lifetime Career Award of the Florence Biennale, Italy. Commissioned by The Other Art Fair, a November 2011 poll of 1,000 British painters and sculptors declared him Britain\\'s most influential artist of all time. In 2012, Hockney was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork–the Beatles\\' Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover–to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\\nHe is an honorary member of the Printmakers Council.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nOn 21 June 2006, Hockney\\'s painting The Splash sold for £2.6 million. It was offered for auction again on 11 February 2020, with an estimate of £20–30 million and sold, to an unknown buyer, for £23.1 million.\\nHis A Bigger Grand Canyon, a series of 60 canvases that combined to produce one enormous picture, was bought by the National Gallery of Australia for $4.6 million.\\n\\nBeverly Hills Housewife (1966–67), a 12-foot-long acrylic that depicts the collector Betty Freeman standing by her pool in a long hot-pink dress, sold for $7.9 million at Christie\\'s in New York in 2008, the top lot of the sale and a record price for a Hockney. This was topped in 2016 when his Woldgate Woods landscape made £9.4 million at auction. The record was broken again in 2018 with the sale of Piscine de Medianoche (Paper Pool 30) for $11.74 million and then doubled in the same Sotheby\\'s auction when Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica sold for $28.5 million.\\nOn 15 November 2018, David Hockney\\'s 1972 painting Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) sold at Christie\\'s for $90.3 million with fees, surpassing the previous auction record for a living artist of $58.4 million, held by Jeff Koons for one of his Balloon Dog sculptures. He had originally sold this painting for $20,000 in 1972.\\n\\n\\n== The Hockney–Falco thesis ==\\n\\nIn the 2001 television programme and book Secret Knowledge, Hockney posited that the Old Masters used camera obscura as well as camera lucida and lens techniques that projected the image of the subject onto the surface of the painting. Hockney argues that this technique migrated gradually from Northern Europe to Italy, and is the reason for the photographic style of painting seen in the Renaissance and later periods of art. He published his conclusions in the 2001 book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters, which was revised in 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Public life ==\\nLike his father, Hockney was a conscientious objector and worked as a medical orderly in hospitals during his National Service, 1957–1959. David Hockney was a founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1979. He was on the advisory board of the political magazine Standpoint; he contributed original sketches for its launch edition in June 2008, as well as agreeing to allow Standpoint to publish his previous views and pictures over the years.\\nHe is a staunch pro-tobacco campaigner. In 2005 he fought to stop the ban on smoking in pubs and restaurants. At the Labour Party conference he held up a card saying \"DEATH awaits you all even if you do smoke\". He was invited to guest-edit BBC Radio\\'s Today programme on 29 December 2009 in which he aired his views on the subject. In 2013 he wrote a foreword and provided illustrations for a book by John Staddon, Unlucky Strike.\\nIn October 2010, he and a hundred other artists signed an open letter to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, protesting against cutbacks in the arts.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\n\\nIn 1966, while working on a series of etchings based on love poems by the Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy, Hockney starred in a documentary by filmmaker James Scott, entitled Love\\'s Presentation. He was the subject of Jack Hazan\\'s 1974 biopic, A Bigger Splash, named after Hockney\\'s 1967 pool painting of the same name. Hockney was also the inspiration of artist Billy Pappas in the documentary film Waiting for Hockney (2008), which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008.\\nHockney was inducted into Vanity Fair\\'s International Best-Dressed Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2005, Burberry creative director Christopher Bailey centred his entire spring/summer menswear collection around the artist and in 2012, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, a close friend, named a checked jacket after Hockney. In 2011, British GQ named him one of the 50 Most Stylish Men in Britain and in March 2013, he was listed as one of the Fifty Best-dressed Over-50s by The Guardian.\\nHockney was commissioned to design the cover and pages for the December 1985 issue of the French edition of Vogue. Consistent with his interest in cubism and admiration for Pablo Picasso, Hockney chose to paint Celia Birtwell (who appears in several of his works) from different views for the cover, as if the eye had scanned her face diagonally. David Hockney: A Rake\\'s Progress (2012) is a biography of Hockney covering the years 1937–1975, by writer/photographer Christopher Simon Sykes.\\nIn 2012, Hockney featured in BBC Radio 4\\'s list of The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Hockney among the group of people in the UK \"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character\". The 2015 Luca Guadagnino\\'s film A Bigger Splash was named after Hockney\\'s painting. In 2022, he was portrayed by Laurence Fuller in the 7th episode of the 1st season of Minx.\\nIn BoJack Horseman, a caricature of Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) hangs on the wall of the title character\\'s home office. In this version, horses replace the two human figures of the original.\\n\\n\\n== David Hockney Foundation ==\\nThe David Hockney Foundation—both the UK registered charity 1127262 and the US 501(c)(3) private operating foundation—was created by the artist in 2008. In 2012, Hockney, worth an estimated $55.2 million (approx. £36.1 m), transferred paintings valued at $124.2 million (approx. £81.5 m) to the David Hockney Foundation, and gave an additional $1.2 million (approx. £0.79 m) in cash to help fund the foundation\\'s operations.\\nThe foundation\\'s mission is to advance appreciation and understanding of visual art and culture through the exhibition, preservation, and publication of David Hockney\\'s work. Richard Benefield, who organised David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition in 2013–2014 at the de Young Museum in San Francisco, became the first executive director in January 2017.\\nThe foundation owns over 8,000 works–paintings, drawings, watercolours, complete editioned prints, stage design, multi-camera movies, and other media.  They also hold 203 sketchbooks and Hockney\\'s personal photo albums from 1961 to 1990. The foundation manages various loans to museums and exhibitions around the world, including Happy Birthday, Mr. Hockney! at the Getty celebrating his 80th birthday, and the retrospective exhibitions of 2017–2018 at the Metropolitan Museum, Centre Georges Pompidou, and Tate Britain.\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\n\\n\\n=== By Hockney ===\\n— (1971). 72 Drawings.

       "  'Ellen Gallagher (born December 16, 1965) is an American artist. Her work has been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions and is held in the permanent collections of many major museums. Her media include painting, works on paper, film and video. Some of her pieces refer to issues of race, and may combine formality with racial stereotypes and depict \"ordering principles\" society imposes.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nGallagher was born on December 16, 1965, in Providence, Rhode Island. Referred to as African American, she is of biracial ethnicity; her father\\'s heritage was from Cape Verde, in Western Africa (but he was born in the United States), and her mother\\'s background was Caucasian Irish Catholic. Gallagher\\'s mother was a working-class Irish-American and her father was a professional boxer.\\nIn Rhode Island, Gallagher attended Moses Brown, an elite, Quaker college preparatory school. At sixteen, Gallagher entered her first year at Oberlin College in Ohio (1982–1984) and studied writing. Gallagher did not finish her education at Oberlin College and ended up joining a carpenters\\' union in Seattle. Before her art career, Gallagher worked as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and Maine. In 1989 she attended Studio 70 in Fort Thomas, Kentucky, before earning a degree in fine arts from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in 1992. Her art education further continued in 1993 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nGallagher gained recognition as an artist in 1995. Prior to her Gagosian showing, Gallagher had solo shows at Mary Boone in Soho, New York, and Anthony D\\'Offay in London. As her first solo show in New York, Gallagher chose Mary Boone\\'s space because of its neutrality, in which she stated, \"because there the abstract qualities of my work stand out first\".\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nGallagher is an abstract painter and multimedia artist creating minimalist work with subject narratives. Gallagher\\'s influences include the paintings of Agnes Martin and the repetitive writings of Gertrude Stein. Some of Gallagher\\'s work involves repetitively modifying advertising found in African American focused publications such as Ebony, Sepia, and Our World, including images from Valmor Products ads, as in her DeLuxe series. Her most famous pieces are her grid-like collages of magazines grouped together into larger pieces. Examples of these are eXelento (2004), Afrylic (2004), and DeLuxe (2005). The series DeLuxe showed multiple creative methods, from photogravure to digital printing. Gallagher used oils to combine different sheets together and add texture. Gallagher pushed the limit between two and three dimensions in her series. She used new technologies to create plates in many layers. Each of these works contains as many as or more than 60 prints employing techniques of photogravure, spit-bite, collage, cutting, scratching, silkscreen, offset lithography and hand-building. Gallagher also glues notebook paper drawings onto her canvas to create textured surfaces.\\nIn her artwork, she combines different traits of three art movements. Two of them mentioned by her are Abstract expressionism and Minimalism., but by observing her use of specific materials like magazines, newspapers, etc. The use of patterns and repetition series as well as the many printing techniques she uses can relate to her work with Pop-art. With stylized allusions to cartoons and childhood toys or via transformed and manipulated advertisements Gallagher\\'s work “seduces the viewer into visceral engagement with images about which we have learned to feel numb.\\nEven though Gallagher does not describe her artwork as any of these art styles individually, not only her but other art-related individuals and regular audiences describe Gallagher\\'s work as singular and interesting. Very contrasting styles combined to give life to meticulously unique Pop-abstract-minimalist artworks\\nSome of Gallagher\\'s early influences while attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston were the Darkroom Collective, a group of poets living and working out of Inman Square in Cambridge, MA and would go on to become the art coordinator of the collective. The Darkroom collective allowed Gallagher to explore her talent and apply her culture as an African-American woman to her work. One of her first exhibits took place at the Dark Room in 1989. Some other influences at the Museum School were Susan Denker, Ann Hamilton, Kiki Smith and Laylah Ali.\\n\\nThemes related to race are often evident in Gallagher\\'s work, sometimes using pictographs, symbols, codes and repetitions. \"Sambo lips\" and \"bug eyes,\" references to the Black minstrel shows, are often scattered throughout Gallagher\\'s works. Additionally, Gallagher would use these symbols in her collage pieces, inspired by lined yellow paper schoolchildren use. Certain characters are also used repeatedly, such as the image of the nurse or the \"Pegleg\" character that sometimes populate her page\\'s iconography. Gallagher made Wiglette from Deluxe 2004 to 2005, which contains a collection of vintage beauty ads from the 1930s to 70s intended for black American women. Through this art piece Ellen Gallagher is once again exploring the intersection of identity, race and culture. When asked about Wiglette in an interview Gallagher said, “The wig ladies are fugitives. Conscripts from another time and place, liberated from the \\'race\\' magazines of the past. But I transformed them-here on the pages that once held them captive.”  Some of her pieces may explicitly reference the issue of race while also having a more subtle undercurrent related to race. She was inspired by the New Negro movement as well as modernist abstraction. Gallagher also uses found historical images in her work. She combines formality (grid lines, ruled paper) with the racial stereotypes to depict the \"ordering principles\" society imposes.\"Blackface minstrel is a ghost story, \" Gallagher has noted. \"It\\'s about loss; there\\'s a black mask and sublimation...[B]lackface minstrel was the first great American abstraction, even before jazz. It\\'s the literal recording of the African body into American public culture. Disembodied eyes and lips float, hostage, in the electric black of the minstrel stage, distorting the African body into American blackface.\" As well as using racially charged imagery, Gallagher is known to portray bodies and include elements of poetry and pop culture in her work. She uses golden tones to portray the racial binary in society. Her media includes paintings, works on paper, film and video. She has made innovative use of materials, such as creating a unique variation on scrimshaw by carving images into the surface of thick sheets of watercolor paper and drawing with ink, watercolor and pencil. Her extensive ongoing series begun in 2001 and titled, Watery Ecstatic, consists of paintings, sculptural objects, and animations to depict sea life through Afrofuturist aesthetics. Gallagher creates different sea creatures to symbolize slave ancestors who died during the transatlantic slave trade across the Atlantic Ocean. These works depict sea creatures, of the mythical undersea world of Drexciya, which were the progeny of slaves who had drowned. This mythology had been conceived by a musical duo of that name, from Detroit. Gallagher commented upon the process of creating these pieces: \"The way that these drawings are made is my version of scrimshaw, the carving into bone that sailors did when they were out whaling. I imagine them in this overwhelming, scary expanse of sea where this kind of cutting would give a focus, a sense of being in control of something.\" Some of Gallagher\\'s work would also consist of codes made from cut out letters. In some of her early pieces, she painted and drew on sheets of penmanship paper (ruled paper used for handwriting practice) she had pasted onto canvas. Her choice of penmanship paper is significant, in an interview with Jessica Morgan, she says \"the sense of a neutral surface that can accommodate any mark seems an ideal way of communicating freedom,\" which is described by her as \"idiosyncratic\" and \"inscrutable\". As her previous work has been critiqued for being too racially charged, her newer work contains less explicit racial images to challenge viewers.\\nIn 1995, Gallagher\\'s work was exhibited at the Whitney Biennial and the Venice Biennale in 2003. Artist Chuck Close created a 2009 tapestry portrait of Gallagher. Gallagher is represented by Gagosian Gallery (New York) and Hauser & Wirth (London). She is based in the United States (New York City) and the Netherlands (Rotterdam).\\n\\n\\n== Awards and fellowships ==\\nAmong the honors that Gallagher has earned are:\\n\\nAnn Gund Scholarship, Skowhegan School of Art, Skowhegan, ME (1993)\\nTraveling Scholar Award, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA (1993)\\nProvincetown Fine Arts Work Center Fellow (1995)\\nMacDowell Colony, New Hampshire (1996)\\nJoan Mitchell Fellowship (1997)\\nAmerican Academy Award in Art (2000)\\nMedal of Honor, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2001)\\nElected Honorary Royal Academician (HonRA) (2021)\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\nEllen Gallagher\\'s work has been featured in solo exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions including:\\n\\nDrawing Center, New York City, Preserve (2001)\\nInstitute of Contemporary Art, Boston USA, \"Watery Ecstatic\" (2001)\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nMurmur.

       "  'Sir Anthony Alfred Caro  (8 March 1924 – 23 October 2013) was an English abstract sculptor whose work is characterised by assemblages of metal using \\'found\\' industrial objects. He began as a member of the modernist school, having worked with Henry Moore early in his career. He was lauded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCaro was born in New Malden, Surrey, England to a Jewish family and was the youngest of three children. \\nWhen Caro was three, his father, a stockbroker, moved the family to a farm in Churt, Surrey. Caro was educated at Charterhouse School, where his housemaster introduced him to Charles Wheeler. During holidays, he studied at the Farnham School of Art (now the University for the Creative Arts) worked in Wheeler\\'s studio. He later earned a degree in engineering at Christ\\'s College, Cambridge. \\nIn 1946, after time in the Royal Navy, he studied sculpture at the Regent Street Polytechnic before pursuing further studies at the Royal Academy Schools from 1947 until 1952.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nAnthony Caro encountered modernism when working as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. After being introduced to the American sculptor David Smith in the early 1960s, he abandoned his earlier figurative work and started constructing sculptures by welding or bolting together pieces of steel such as I-beams, steel plates and meshes. Twenty Four Hours (1960), in Tate Britain since 1975, is one of his earliest abstract sculptures in painted steel. Often the finished piece was then painted in a bold flat colour.\\nCaro found international success in the late 1950s. He is often credited with the significant innovation of removing the sculpture from its plinth, although Smith and Brâncuși had both previously taken steps in the same direction. Caro\\'s sculptures are usually self-supporting and sit directly on the floor. In doing so, they remove a barrier between the work and the viewer, who is invited to approach and interact with the sculpture from all sides.\\nIn 1980, Caro was trying to organise an exhibition of British abstract art in South African townships when he met Robert Loder. In 1981, when staying in New York State, the pair developed the idea of running workshops for professional artists, which became the Triangle Arts Trust. They held the first Triangle workshop in 1982 for thirty sculptors and painters from the US, the UK and Canada at Pine Plains, New York.\\nCaro\\'s work changed direction in the 1980s with the introduction of more literal elements, with a series of figures drawn from classical Greece. After visiting Greece in 1985, and closely studying classical friezes, he embarked on a series of large-scale narrative works, including After Olympia, a panorama more than 23 metres (75 ft) long, inspired by the temple to Zeus at Olympia. Latterly he has attempted large scale installation pieces, one of which, Sea Music, stands on the quay at Poole, Dorset.\\nIn the early 2000s, his work featured nearly life-size equestrian figures built from fragments of wood and terra cotta on gymnasts\\' vaulting horses. In 2008, Caro opened his \"Chapel of Light\" installation in the Saint Jean-Baptiste Church of Bourbourg (France), and exhibited four figurative head sculptures at the National Portrait Gallery, London. In 2011 the Metropolitan Museum of Art installed five works by Caro on their rooftop. As of 2012, Caro was working on an immense, multipart sculpture that would occupy three blocks of Midtown Park Avenue.\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\n\\nCaro was also a tutor at Saint Martin\\'s School of Art in London, inspiring a younger generation of British abstract sculptors, led by former students and assistants including Phillip King, Tim Scott, William G. Tucker, Peter Hide, and Richard Deacon; as well as a reaction group including Bruce McLean, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long, David Hall and Gilbert & George. He and several former students were asked to join the seminal 1966 show at the Jewish Museum in New York entitled, Primary Structures representing the British influence on the \"New Art\". Caro taught at Bennington College from 1963 to 1965, along with painter Jules Olitski and sculptor David Smith.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture and design ===\\nCaro also collaborated with celebrated architects, notably Frank Gehry, with whom he constructed a wooden village in New York in 1987. With Norman Foster and the engineer Chris Wise, he designed the London Millennium Footbridge spanning the Thames between St. Paul\\'s Cathedral and the Tate Modern.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nSince the 1950s, Caro\\'s work has been shown in museums and galleries worldwide.\\nHis first solo exhibition was at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan in 1956, and his first solo show in London was at the Gimpel Fils Gallery the next year. Another solo show was at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1963. In 1967 Caro began exhibiting regularly with Kasmin in London, and in 1969, he began showing with André Emmerich in New York. In the same year he showed at the São Paulo Biennale with John Hoyland. In 2004, to honour his 80th birthday, Tate Britain and Kenwood House held exhibitions of his work.\\nCaro\\'s museum exhibitions include \"Anthony Caro: A Retrospective\" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1975, travelled to Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston); \"Anthony Caro\", Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (1995); \"Anthony Caro\", Tate Britain, London (2005); three museums in Pas-de-Calais, France (2008), to accompany the opening of his Chapel of Light at Bourbourg; and \"Anthony Caro on the Roof\", Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2011). In 2012 the Yale Center for British Art presented \"Caro: Close Up\".\\nFrom 1 June to 27 October 2013 in connection with the 55th Venice Biennale, he exhibited at the Museo Correr, Venice, Italy. The exhibit was on at the time of his death.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nCaro was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1969 New Year Honours. He was knighted in the 1987 Birthday Honours and received the Order of Merit in May 2000. He was awarded many prizes, including the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1949, Caro married the painter Sheila Girling  and they had two sons together: Timothy (born 1951), a zoologist; and Paul (born 1958, a painter.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nCaro was 89 when he died of a heart attack on 23 October 2013. He was lauded as a \"gentle man with a pioneering spirit\" by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz and \"one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century\" by Royal Academy of Arts chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith. He is buried in the churchyard of Worth Matravers, Dorset.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBarker, Ian, Anthony Caro: Quest for the New Sculpture (Aldershot: Lund Humphries, 2004) ISBN 978-0-85331-910-8.\\nReid, Mary, Anthony Caro: Drawing in Space (Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2009) ISBN 978-1-84822-030-0.\\nWilkin, Karen, Anthony Caro: Interior and Exterior (Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2009) ISBN 978-1-84822-031-7.\\nJulius Bryant, Julius, Anthony Caro: Figurative and Narrative Sculpture (Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2009) ISBN 978-1-84822-032-4.\\nWestley Smith, H.F., Anthony Caro: Small Sculptures (Farnham, Lund Humphries, 2010) ISBN 978-1-84822-051-5.\\nMoorhouse, Paul, Anthony Caro: Presence (Farnham, Lund Humphries, 2010) ISBN 978-1-84822-053-9.\\nSaunders, Wade, Anthony Caro Recent Sculptures (Baltimore, C.

       "  'Félix González-Torres or Felix Gonzalez-Torres (November 26, 1957 – January 9, 1996) was a Cuban-born American visual artist. He lived and worked primarily in New York City between 1979 and 1995 after attending university in Puerto Rico. González-Torres’s practice incorporates a minimalist visual vocabulary and certain artworks that are composed of everyday materials such as strings of light bulbs, paired wall clocks, stacks of paper, and individually wrapped candies. González-Torres is known for having made significant contributions to the field of conceptual art in the 1980s and 1990s. His practice continues to influence and be influenced by present-day cultural discourses. González-Torres died in Miami in 1996 from AIDS-related illness.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nGonzález-Torres was trained as a photographer and his oeuvre incorporates this medium in varying ways. He is well known for works that transform commonplace materials into installations that foster meaningful responses from audiences, as well as works with which audiences can choose to physically interact, and works that may be manifested anew and can change each time they are exhibited. González-Torres stated “the only thing permanent is change,” always questioning the stability of the art object.\\nThroughout much of González-Torres\\'s practices, he purposefully incorporated dissonant information and formats. Examples of these contradictions include the way he structured courses as a professor, wrote press releases and texts, gave lectures, participated in interviews, and created varying strategies for each body of work. One particular example is the way Gonzalez-Torres structured a lecture on the occasion of a solo-exhibition of his work at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago in 1994. Following a slide show of various artworks and exhibitions in which his work was included, Gonzalez-Torres proceeded to read a prepared statement reflecting on the current national deficit, government budget allocations for public housing versus military spending, incarceration and poverty rates, and inequitable wealth distribution. He closed the lecture with a quote from a New York Times article that establishes a legacy of contention around the separation of church and state. This methodology was intended to foster individuals’ right and responsibility to have their own point of view.\\nOver time the work has been interpreted through varying critical lenses, including: the subjective construction of histories, questions of monumentality and attachment to permanency; the profoundness of love and partnership, codes and resilience of queer love; the role of ownership; perceptions of value and authority; discourse around death, loss, and the potentiality of renewal; questions of display and conditions of reception, notions of disidentification; the role and subversiveness of beauty; the rewards and consequences of generosity; arbitrary delineations between private and public selves/places; social, political, and personal dimensions of the AIDS epidemic; questions of established economic and political structures; occupation of the margins and infiltration of centers of power; the instability of language and what is connoted vs. denoted; somatic responses/forms of knowledge; etc. At the core of so many of the artist’s works is the physical experience of the works and their capacity to be manifest in perpetually changing circumstances. \\nGonzalez-Torres stated that his work requires an audience, following Bertolt Brecht’s theory of Epic Theatre. This is a theory that means an audience member is primed to have an individualized response to a performance that leads them to effect change in the world. Gonzalez-Torres maintained that his work should always remain open to new and changing interpretations. While Gonzalez-Torres’s work is conceptual, the formal qualities of the work are especially powerful in their ability to elicit individualized emotional responses from each viewer. “My work is about the daily dealing with events, and objects that form, transform, and affect my positioning.”\\n\\n\\n=== Categories and bodies of work ===\\nCategories and Bodies of Work most often reflect the way that Gonzalez-Torres commonly referred to works in his lifetime. Certain works may fit into more than one category/body of work. Some bodies of work by González-Torres\\'s are accompanied by Certificates of Authenticity and Ownership. The certificate includes information about the parameters for installing or exhibiting the work, the conceptual nature of the work, as well as the owner\\'s integral role in the artwork.\\n\\n\\n==== Billboards ====\\nThe billboard works date from 1989 to 1995. The billboard works consist of specific images or texts that are installed at billboard scale. It is essential to 14 of the 17 billboard works that they must be installed in multiple, diverse, public/outdoor sets of locations (ideally 24 locations at a time). Documentation of each billboard location is an essential aspect of these works.\\n\\n\\n==== Birds in sky ====\\nThe ‘birds in sky’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Images of birds in the sky are featured across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice, including billboards, doubles, framed photographs, paper stack, pedestals/platforms, and puzzles.\\n\\n\\n==== Candy works ====\\nThe ‘candy works’ date from 1990 to 1993. The dimensions for the majority of the candy works include an “ideal weight.” (In total there are 20 candy works. Fifteen of the candy works have ideal ‘weights’, four of these ‘ideal weights’ may correlate to an average body weight of an adult male, and three may correlate to a combined average body weight of two adult men.) The medium for each candy work includes “endless supply” as well as “dimensions vary with installation.” When candies are present in a manifestation of a candy work, it is integral that viewers must be permitted to choose to take individual pieces of candy from the work. The candies may or may not be replenished at any time. Candy works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. Each of the candy works are unique.\\n\\n\\n==== Curtains ====\\nThe ‘curtain’ works date from 1989 to 1995. The fabric curtain work is intended to be installed on existing windows as standard curtains would typically appear. There are five beaded curtain works, each with a specific bead pattern, and one fabric curtain work. Beaded curtain works must be installed in locations where individuals would naturally have the choice to pass through them and the work’s dimensions vary with installation. Curtain works can exist in more than one place at a time.\\n\\n\\n==== Doubles ====\\nThe ‘doubles’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Doubled objects, images, and motifs feature across the majority of the bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Framed photographs ====\\nThe framed photographic works date from 1986 to 1995. The artist considered the frame to be an essential element of these works. This is one of many bodies of Gonzalez-Torres’s works that incorporate photographic methodologies. Many of the artist’s framed photographs were purposefully analog, developed and processed by hand, as opposed to other photographic works by Gonzalez-Torres which emphasized mechanical reproducibility and the overt removal of the artist’s hand.\\n\\n\\n==== Graphs ====\\nThe ‘graph’ works date from 1988 to 1994. With the exception of one photograph, the ‘graph’ works are the only works that have hand drawn elements. The ‘graph’ works consist of both painting and drawings. While some of these works have been contextualized as representations of individuals’ medical charts, the graph works are intentionally non-specific and are also referential to other graphed data.\\n\\n\\n==== Image transfers ====\\nThe ‘image transfers’ date from 1987 to 1992. All three of these works are made in editions. Two of these works are intended to be permanently installed directly on the wall and the third is intended to be permanently tattooed.\\n\\n\\n==== Light strings ====\\nThe ‘light string’ works date from 1992 to 1994. The light strings were produced by an electrician in conversation with the artist and consist of commonplace electrical components. Each light string work can only exist in one place at a time; which is in contrast to Gonzalez-Torres’s manifestable works that are also made of commonplace materials. The dimensions of a light string work vary with each installation; the exhibitor’s choice of configuration for each installation completes the work. There are 24 individual light string works; 22 are unique and two are editioned works. The light strings works are intended to be displayed either with all the bulbs on or all the bulbs off; light bulbs are replaced promptly as necessary. The relative brightness of the lightbulbs for each light string work is specified but the actual brightness may vary from one installation to the next.\\n\\n\\n==== Mirrors ====\\nThere are four individual mirror works dating from 1992 to 1994. Three of these works consist of mirrors of a specific size that are either hung on or embedded in the wall. One of the mirror works consists of a mirrored box that is displayed on the ground.\\n\\n\\n==== Multiples ====\\nThe category of multiples represents those works made in edition sizes ranging from six to unlimited. There are 18 individual multiples in various mediums, dating from 1987 to 1995. Many of the works in this category purposefully resemble unique works, questioning notions of value and the power of the language of categorization.\\n\\n\\n==== Newspaper and magazine clippings ====\\nImagery sourced from ‘newspaper and magazine clippings’ features across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice including paper stacks, puzzles, framed works and paintings. These works include images and texts that pertain to politics, violence, consumerism, mass culture, and religion. Images of crowds are especially prominent in this category of works, and this motif carries its own diverse scope of meanings in the artist’s work. \\n\\n\\n==== Paintings ====\\nThe ‘paintings’ date from 1992 to 1994. There are 15 individual paintings, and each of the works is unique. Five of the works are circular canvases painted black with circular newspaper/magazine clippings of crowd imagery adhered to the canvases. Seven of the paintings are graph works. Nine of the painting works include multiple components of the same or similar sizes and shapes.\\n\\n\\n==== Paper stacks ====\\nThe ‘paper stacks’ date from 1988 to 1993. The paper stack works consist of a stack (or stacks) of paper. It is integral to the manifestable paper stack works that individuals must be permitted to choose to take individual sheets of paper from the work. Each paper stack work has a specific text, design, image, and/or paper color that is integral to the work. There are 45 individual paper stack works; three of the paper stack works are static (the sheets are not intended to be replenished) and four of the paper stack works have additional installation elements. The sheets used to manifest a paper stack work may or may not be replenished at any time. Manifestable paper stack works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. There are 42 unique paper stack works; four were made in an edition.\\n\\n\\n==== Pedestals / platforms ====\\nThe ‘pedestals/platforms’ date from 1987 to 1992. There are seven individual pedestal/platform works, and each is unique. Two early sculpture works were presented on platforms, the first of the paper stack works includes a platform, one puzzle is presented on a platform, the one video work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice includes a platform. Two works consist of platforms, one work that includes an optional performer and one of the mirror works. Strategies that identify and question the significance of modes of presentation for artworks can be traced throughout the artist’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Photostats ====\\nThe ‘photostats’ date from 1987 to 1992. The photostats were made in small edition sizes ranging from one to four, typically with a single artist’s proof. The photostats consist of lines of white text reproduced on a solid black background. Each of the photostats are framed in simple black metal frames and the glazing reflects the viewer in the work. There are thirteen individual photostats. (These works have sometimes been referred to as ‘date pieces.’)\\n\\n\\n==== Portraits ====\\nThe portrait works date from 1989 to 1994. The portrait works consist of a horizontal line (or lines) of textual entries installed directly on the wall just below the point where the wall meets the ceiling. It is essential to the portrait works that the owner has the right to change the content of the portrait at any time, which may include: adding, subtracting, editing and sequencing entries. Portrait works can exist in more than one place at a time and dimensions vary with installation. The typeface of the text for portrait works is Trump Medieval Bold Italic. The color of the text, and in some cases the optional band of background color, is specified for each work.\\n\\n\\n==== Puzzles ====\\nThe 59 puzzle works date from 1987 to 1992. In the process of making these works, Gonzalez-Torres sent snapshots to commercial photo labs that produced novelty items, such as puzzles, from personal photos. The imagery for the puzzle works ranges from photographs of Gonzalez-Torres’s personal life to re-photographed newspaper/magazine clippings. Most consist of one individual puzzle, although four works consist of multiple components. Most puzzle works are made in editions of three with one AP (55 puzzles). There are three unique puzzle works. Those puzzles that were made in an edition may not have been produced at the same time or by the same commercial photo lab; which resulted in variations in cropping and color tone within the same edition. This body of work illustrates Gonzalez-Torres’s interest in varying modes of photographic reproduction, the effects of commercial production processes on the form of the works, and his utilization of commonplace consumer products in his practice. The puzzles were received from the photo lab fully assembled with a piece of cardboard backing and sealed inside a fitted plastic bag. For the majority of the puzzle works (56 puzzles), the artist considered the plastic bags to be an important part of the works and he described a specific method of installation using map pins (originally pushed through and eventually positioned against the plastic bags). For owner’s who requested to frame these works, the artist provided a separate methodology for framing.\\n\\n\\n===== Dateline installations =====\\n\\nAcross several bodies of work, starting as early as 1987, González-Torres employed a strategy, described by some as a “dateline,” wherein he included lists of various events/dates in a purposeful but non-chronological order. The lists included the names of social and political figures and references to cultural phenomena or world events, many of which had political and cultural historical significance. In the body of photostat works, the events/dates are printed in white type on black sheets of photographic paper presented in basic frames with reflective glazing. The viewer’s reflection was visible when reading the line of text. These lists of seeming non sequiturs prompted viewers to consider the relationships and gaps between the diverse references as well the construction of individual and collective identities and memories. González-Torres also employed this strategy for the portraits, as in \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Jennifer Flay) (1993), which includes, \"A New Dress 1971 Vote for Women, NZ 1893 JFK 1963\" as well as for the billboards, as in “Untitled” (1989), which includes, “People With AIDS Coalition 1985 Police Harassment 1969 Oscar Wilde 1895.”\\n\\n\\n=== Various Installations and Interpretations ===\\n\\nAll of González-Torres\\'s works, with few exceptions, are titled \"Untitled\" in quotation marks, sometimes followed by a parenthetical portion of the title. This was an intentional titling scheme by the artist. Rather than limiting the artworks by ascribing any singular title, the artist titled his works in this way to allow for open-ended interpretations to unfold over time. In a 1991 interview with Robert Nickas, González-Torres reflected on the titles of his artworks: “things are suggested or alluded to discreetly. The work is untitled because “meaning” is always shifting in time and place.”\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s manifestable works incorporate the process of change. A 1991 installation of \"Untitled\" (Placebo), a candy work, consisted of a carpet (roughly 20 x 30 feet) of shiny silver wrapped candies. The candies covered the floor from one side of the room to the other and extended all the way to the back wall opposite the visitor. In 2011, the same candy work, \"Untitled\" (Placebo), was installed at the Museum of Modern Art in two large rectangles divided by a walkway for visitors. A borrower/exhibitor may choose to install the work in any configuration and can also choose to use amounts of candies that differ from the \"ideal weight\". Like other candy pieces in his oeuvre, this work has an \"ideal weight\" that remains constant while the actual weight of the installed candy may fluctuate during the course of an exhibition and also from one exhibition to the next.  \\nIn 1989 González-Torres presented \"Untitled\" (Memorial Day Weekend) and \"Untitled\" (Veterans Day Sale), exhibited together as \"Untitled\" (Monuments): block-like stacks of paper printed with ambiguous content, from which the viewer is allowed to choose to take a sheet. Rather than constituting a solid, immovable monument, the stacks can be dispersed, depleted, and renewed over time. \\nAt Roni Horn\\'s 1990 solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, González-Torres encountered her sculpture \"Forms from the Gold Field\" (1980–82). González-Torres later wrote about his experience of Horn\\'s work in \"1990: L.A., The Gold Field.\" which was first published in Horn\\'s catalogue \"Roni Horn. Earths Grow Thick.\" González-Torres and Horn became acquaintances in the early 1990s, and he later created \"Untitled\" (Placebo – Landscape – for Roni) (1993). \\n\\nOne of his most recognizable works, \"Untitled\" (1991), a billboard work which features a black-and-white photograph of an unmade bed, was installed in twenty-four outdoor public locations all over New York City in 1992. Viewers would come upon the work unexpectedly while walking the streets in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Manhattan. The billboards were installed in the same manner, scale, and location as existing commercial advertising billboards. The installation, Projects 34: Felix Gonzalez-Torres, was curated and organized by Anne Umland in her role as Curatorial Assistant at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The work is dated 1991, the same year as the death of his long-time partner, Ross Laycock, from AIDS-related illness.  \\n\"Untitled\" (It\\'s Just a Matter of Time) is a billboard originally exhibited in 1992 in Hamburg, reading \"Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit.\" Whereas the general phrase It\\'s Just a Matter of Time remains constant from one installation to the next, the language the phrase is presented in may change depending on the local languages where the work is being installed.\\nIn 1993, González-Torres mounted two simultaneous gallery exhibitions in Paris entitled Travel #1 (at Galerie Ghislaine Hussenot) and Travel #2 at Galerie Jennifer Flay.\\n\\nIn addition to his manifestable “candy works” and “paper stacks”, González-Torres created other malleable works referred to as \"light strings\", which consist of generally lower-wattage/dimmer light bulbs on extension cords, installed however the exhibitor chooses; eg. hung on the wall, piled on floor, strung across a doorway, etc. The body of light strings includes fifteen physically identical light strings, each has 42 light bulbs in white porcelain light sockets, the works are differentiated only by their parenthetical titles and the types of display/installation chosen by each work\\'s owner on an ongoing basis, as well as the display/installation that authorized borrowers chose in the context of loans. Each sculpture can be arranged in any way a particular installer wishes, and thus holds the potential for unlimited variations. Over the course of any given installation, some of the bulbs may burn out but the parameters of the work specify that they have to be replaced.\\nIn 1991 González-Torres began producing sculptures consisting of strands of plastic beads strung on metal rods, which some have interpreted to include references to the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.\\n\\n\\n=== Legacy ===\\nIn May 2002, the Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation was created. The Foundation \"maintains, builds, and facilitates knowledge and understanding around the work of Gonzalez-Torres.\" The Foundation fields exhibition requests that include Felix Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work or respond to the artist\\'s practice in some way and offers ongoing guidance and support for these exhibitions. The Foundation maintains extensive exhibition and image archives and makes them accessible to anyone interested in learning about Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. The Foundation also facilitates publication projects and licenses copyright in Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. \\nThe Foundation assisted the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in the organization of the Felix González-Torres Community Art Project, a three-year initiative that sponsors visits of internationally renowned contemporary artists to the campus of the school. The Foundation initiated and funded the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Felix González-Torres Travel Grant Program, a five-year initiative that funds travel based projects for CalArts students.\\nSince 1990, González-Torres\\'s  work has been represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery, which exhibited his work both before and after his death. Starting in 2017, the estate of Felix Gonzalez-Torres has been co-represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery and David Zwirner gallery, New York.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century the critical legacy of González-Torres\\'s  work has continued to be expanded and challenged. In 2010 Artforum published an article by artist and critic Joe Scanlan titled \"The Uses of Disorder\" that took a darker look at the soft power and neoliberal economics at play in González-Torres\\'s  work. In 2017 there was public outcry over the fact that David Zwirner Gallery mounted an extensive exhibition of González-Torres\\'s  work but made no mention of the role that AIDS played in the works\\' conceptual formation, either in the exhibition proper or its press release.\\n\\n\\n=== Art market ===\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s candy work \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Marcel Brient) (1992) sold for $4.6 million at Phillips de Pury & Company in 2010, a record for the artist at auction at the time. In November 2015 González-Torres\\'s \"Untitled\" (L.A.) (1991), a 50 lb. installation of green hard candies, sold for $7.7 million at Christie\\'s, New York, a new record at the time. In 2024 his light-string work \"Untitled\" (America #3) (1992) sold for $13.6 million, also at Christie\\'s, a new record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and education ==\\nIn January 1970, González-Torres fled Cuba for Madrid, Spain when he was 12 with his older sister. Later that same year, he relocated to Puerto Rico.\\nGonzález-Torres attended the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan from 1975-1979. He moved to New York on academic scholarship to study photography at Pratt Institute in 1979, attending the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1981 and 1983. He received a BFA in photography from Pratt Institute in 1983 and obtained an MFA from the International Center of Photography and New York University in 1987.\\nHe was an adjunct Art Instructor at New York University, New York from 1987-1989 and in 1992. In 1990, Gonzalez-Torres lived in Los Angeles and taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Gonzalez-Torres was a member of Group Material from 1987-1994. In 1992 González-Torres was granted a DAAD fellowship to work in Berlin, and in 1993 a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\\nHe became an American citizen by applying for naturalization as a refugee and he chose to refer to himself as American. His name has appeared as Félix González; professionally, he chose to style his name as Felix Gonzalez-Torres and also as Félix González-Torres in languages that include diacritics.\\nThe artist met his long-term partner Ross Laycock in 1983 in New York. González-Torres and Laycock were in a relationship from 1983 – 1991; for the majority of their relationship they lived in different cities except for a period when they lived together in Los Angeles in 1990. In January 1991, Laycock died of AIDS-related causes in Toronto. Félix González\\'s partner towards the end of his life was Rafael Vasquez.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\nGonzález-Torres staged many solo exhibitions, installations, and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally during his lifetime. His notable solo shows include Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1988), New Museum, New York; Untitled: An Installation by Félix González-Torres as part of the Visual Aids Program (1989-1990), Brooklyn Museum, New York; Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1993), Magasin III Museum for Contemporary Art, Stockholm; Felix Gonzalez-Torres: Traveling (1994), originating at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1995-1996), originating at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, exhibited as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (A Possible Landscape) at Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Girlfriend in a Coma) at Musée d\\'Art Moderne de Paris.\\nThe artist also participated in numerous group shows during his lifetime, including the Whitney Biennial (1991); the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); and the Biennale of Sydney (1996).\\n\\n\\n=== Selected posthumous exhibitions ===\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1997) ====\\nImmediately following the artist\\'s death in 1996, the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, organized a career retrospective of his work, in conjunction with the publication of a two-volume catalogue raisonné covering nearly all of the artist\\'s output.\\n\\n\\n==== U.S. Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) ====\\n\\nIn 2007, González-Torres was selected as the United States\\' official representative at the Venice Biennale, curated by Nancy Spector. The artist\\'s previously controversial status influenced the 1995 decision to reject him for the Venice pavilion in favor of Bill Viola. His posthumous show (the only other posthumous representative from the United States was Robert Smithson in 1982) at the U.S. Pavilion featured, among others, \"Untitled\" (1992–1995).\\n\\n\\n==== Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form (2010–2011) ====\\nBetween 2010 and 2011, a traveling retrospective, Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form, was shown at Wiels Contemporary Art Centre in Brussels, the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, and the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt. At each of the stages of the exhibition tour, the show was initially installed by the exhibition\\'s curator Elena Filipovic and, halfway through its duration, is completely reinstalled by a different selected artist whose own practice has been influenced by González-Torres. Artists Carol Bove, Danh Vo, and Tino Sehgal were chosen to curate the show\\'s second half.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation (2021) ====\\nIn 2021, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art presented Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation. The exhibition was curated by Tanya Barson.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (2023) ====\\nIn 2023, David Zwirner Gallery in New York staged its second posthumous solo exhibition of work by González-Torres, including two works that had never been executed as the artist envisioned. The first, \"Untitled\" (Sagitario) (1994-1995), is a variant of the double pools of water the artist had sketched before his death: two large pools of water were embedded in the gallery floor directly adjacent to one another. This work had first been executed posthumously as two outdoor pools embedded in the ground at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, in 2001 in conjunction with the group exhibition No es sólo lo que ves: pervirtiendo el minimalismo, but the artist had originally envisioned the pools to be installed indoors. The second newly exhibited work, \"Untitled\" (1994-1995), consists of a series of indoor billboard installations that the artist had originally designed for his unrealized exhibition at the Musée d\\'Art Contemporain in Bordeaux.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n1988 Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Cintas Foundation Fellowship Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n1991 Gordon Matta-Clark Foundation Award\\n1992 Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst Fellowship (DAAD) Artists-in-Residence Program, Berlin\\n1993 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAult, Julie, and Andrea Rosen.

       "  'Joe Stefanelli (March 20, 1921 – September 27, 2017), also known as Joseph J. Stefanelli, belonged to the New York School Abstract Expressionist artists whose influence and artistic innovation by the 1950s had been recognized around the world. New York School Abstract Expressionism, represented by Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and others became a leading art movement of the  era that followed World War II.

       "  'Larry Rivers (born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg; August 17, 1923 – August 14, 2002) was an American artist, musician, filmmaker, and occasional actor. Considered by many scholars to be the \"Godfather\" and \"Grandfather\" of Pop art, he was one of the first artists to merge non-objective, non-narrative art with narrative and objective abstraction.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nLarry Rivers was born as Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg in the Bronx, New York, in the family of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. Rivers took up painting in 1945 and studied at the Hans Hofmann School from 1947 through 1948. He earned a BA in art education from New York University in 1951.\\nHis work was quickly acquired by the Museum of Modern Art. A 1953 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware was damaged in fire at the museum five years later.\\nHe was a pop artist of the New York School, reproducing everyday objects of American popular culture as art. He was one of eleven New York artists featured in the opening exhibition at the Terrain Gallery in 1955.\\nHe has been contextualised as working out of the Abstract expressionist legacy of Willem de Kooning, \"adapting the freedom of the Abstract Expressionist technique towards figurative ends.\"\\nDuring the early 1960s Rivers lived in Manhattan\\'s Hotel Chelsea, notable for its artistic residents such as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Arthur C. Clarke, Dylan Thomas, Sid Vicious and multiple people associated with Andy Warhol\\'s Factory and where he brought several of his French nouveau réalistes friends like Yves Klein who wrote there in April 1961 his Manifeste de l\\'hôtel Chelsea, Arman, Martial Raysse, Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint-Phalle, Christo, Daniel Spoerri or Alain Jacquet, several of whom, like Rivers, left some pieces of art in the lobby of the hotel for payment of their rooms. In 1965, Rivers had his first comprehensive retrospective in five important American museums. \\nHis final work for the exhibition was The History of the Russian Revolution, which was later on extended permanent display at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC. He spent 1967 in London collaborating with the American painter Howard Kanovitz.\\nIn 1967, Rivers traveled to Africa for a second time with Pierre Dominique Gaisseau to finish their documentary Africa and I, which was a part of the groundbreaking NBC series Experiments in Television. During this trip they narrowly escaped execution as suspected mercenaries.\\nDuring the 1970s, Rivers worked closely with Diana Molinari and Michel Auder on many video tape projects, including the infamous Tits, and also worked in neon.\\nRivers\\'s legs appeared in John Lennon and Yoko Ono\\'s 1971 film Up Your Legs Forever.\\nIn 1971, he curated Some American History at the Institute for the Arts at Rice University in Houston, where his own work was exhibited alongside that of Ellsworth Ausby, Peter Bradley, Frank Bowling, Daniel LaRue Johnson, Joe Overstreet, and William T. Williams.\\n\\n\\n== Music ==\\nBetween 1940 and 1945, he worked as a jazz saxophonist in New York City; he changed his name to Larry Rivers in 1940 after being introduced as \"Larry Rivers and the Mudcats\". He studied at the Juilliard School of Music in 1945–46, along with Miles Davis, with whom he remained friends until Davis\\'s death in 1991.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nLarry Rivers was born in the Bronx to Samuel and Sonya Grossberg, Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He changed his name to Rivers in 1940 at the start of his career as jazz saxophonist.\\nIn 1945, he married Augusta Berger, and they had one son, Steven. Rivers also adopted Joseph, Berger\\'s son from a previous relationship, and reared both children after the couple divorced. He lived with his mother-in-law, Berdie Burger, who was a favorite model of his, in Southampton, Long Island, from 1953 through 1957.\\nIn 1961, he married Clarice Price, a Welsh school teacher, who cared for his two sons. The couple had two daughters together, Gwynne and Emma, but the telationship lasted only six years before Larry and Clarice separated. \\nShortly after, he lived and collaborated with Diana Molinari, who featured in many of his works of the 1970s.\\nRivers then lived with Sheila Lanham, a Baltimore artist and poet.\\nIn the early 1980s, Rivers and East Village figurative painter Daria Deshuk (1956–2017) lived together and, in 1985, they produced a son, Sam Deshuk Rivers. They remained good friends until Rivers\\'s death.\\nRivers also maintained a relationship with poet Frank O\\'Hara in the late 1950s and delivered the eulogy at O\\'Hara\\'s funeral, in 1966.\\nThroughout his career, the artist maintained studios in New York City; Southampton, Long Island; and Zihuatanejo, Mexico.\\nRivers died in 2002, leaving behind his five children and then companion, poet Jeni Olin.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nHis primary gallery was the Marlborough Gallery in New York City. In 2002, a major retrospective of Rivers\\'s work was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. New York University bought correspondences and other documents from the Larry Rivers Foundation to house in their archive. However, his daughters Gwynne and Emma objected to one particular film being displayed, as it depicts them naked as children and adolescents. The film\\'s purpose is supposedly the documentation of their growth through puberty, but it was made when they were not consenting adults. The matter was addressed in the December 2010 issue of the magazine Vanity Fair, and the October 2010 issue of Grazia. The film will never be publicly displayed as requested by both children. \\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBodley Gallery\\nLGBT culture in New York City\\nList of LGBT people from New York City\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBaskind, Samantha, Jewish Artists and the Bible in Twentieth-Century America,Philadelphia, PA, Penn State University Press, 2014, ISBN 978-0-271-05983-9\\nMarika Herskovic, New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.)

       "  'Miodrag Đurić (Montenegrin: Миодраг Ђурић; 4 October 1933 – 27 November 2010), known as Dado (Montenegrin: Дадо), was a Montenegrin-born artist who spent most of his life and creative career in France. He is particularly known as a painter but was also active as an engraver, draftsman, book illustrator and sculptor.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education (1933–1955) ==\\nĐurić was born on 4 October 1933, in Cetinje, the historic capital of Montenegro, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and grew up in a middle-class family. His mother, Vjera Đurić (née Kujačić), was a biology teacher, and his father, Ranko Đurić, belonged to a family of entrepreneurs.\\nHis childhood years were affected by world events and by personal tragedies. During World War II, Yugoslavia endured Italian and German occupation, while the local Partisans initiated a resistance that led to the emergence of Tito\\'s Yugoslavia.\\nAt the age of 11, Đurić lost his mother in a country still coping with the wounds of war. He then temporarily moved to Slovenia to be put up by a maternal uncle. Although uninterested in general education, Đurić developed a strong interest in art and displayed early creative skills. His family supported him to develop his talent and he started studying fine arts in the maritime town of Herceg Novi between 1947 and 1951.\\nFrom 1951, Đurić moved to Serbia to carry on his education in the fine arts school of Belgrade.\\n\\n\\n== Arrival in France and first exhibitions in Paris (1956–1961) ==\\nEncouraged by one of his teachers in Belgrade, Đurić moved to Paris, France, in 1956 in the hope to work there as an artist. He survived thanks to small jobs and eventually was hired in a lithography workshop run by Gérard Patrice. In the meantime and through his professional environment, he learned French fast enough to be able to meet and interact with well-established artists such as Kalinowski and Jean Dubuffet. These meetings and his showing some of his drawings and paintings raised the curiosity of artists and art dealers alike.\\nArt dealer and former resistant Daniel Cordier discovered the young Đurić and offered him the unique opportunity to show his work in his art gallery in 1958: Dado\\'s professional career was launched. Dado quickly moved from Paris to the countryside of Vexin. In 1960, he settled in a former water mill in Hérouval, Oise. This place was a haven of creation and social life until his death. During these first years in France, he developed a particularly strong friendship with Bernard Réquichot, a French artist who died in 1961.\\n\\n\\n== Active years in France (1962–2010) ==\\n\\n\\n=== Painting and drawing ===\\nDado\\'s painting and drawing activities extended across almost six decades. His paintings are mainly oil painting on linen but he also used acrylic paint and wood or even metal plates as supports.\\n\\nThough his creative world is highly recognizable, his style and painting technique evolved along the years. While painting, he conducted a permanent search for the essence of energy, progressively abandoning details and fine techniques in favour of more colourful and dynamic compositions.\\nAn illustration of this evolution can be seen in large paintings such as Les Limbes or Le Massacre des Innocents (1958–1959), La Grande Ferme. Hommage à Bernard Réquichot (1962–1963), Le Diptyque d\\'Hérouval (1975–1976) and L\\'École de Prescillia (2001–2002), in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, Musée national d\\'art moderne, Paris.\\nFrom the 1990s, Dado also involved himself in several ambitious fresco projects. The four most noticeable achievements are a blockhaus in Fécamp (Normandy), the embassy of the IVth International in Montjavoult (near Hérouval), a set of frescos in a former vine industry building in Domaine des Orpellières, Hérault and a Last Judgment fresco in the former chapel of a leper colony in the town of Gisors, Eure.\\nDrawing had been present in Dado\\'s creative means of expression since his beginnings. The artist initially used pencils and India ink. He also resorted to mixed techniques using gouache, pencils and India ink, realising impressive collages.\\n\\n\\n=== Engravings ===\\nDado realised his first engraving (a dry-point) in 1966 in Georges Visat\\'s workshop. He was also interested in lithography. Dado started exploring the techniques of engraving (copper-plate engraving and etching) with the help of Alain Controu in Normandy in 1967. Their collaboration continued until the 1990s.\\n\\nHe continued a substantial work in this domain, including several years in the 1980s in the Lacourière-Frélaut Engraving workshop in Paris and in an engraving workshop close to Hérouval (collaboration with engraver Biel Genty). A part of his engraving work features in the collections of the Département des estampes et de la Photographie of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (in English: The Department of Stamps and Photography of the National Library of France).\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture and ceramics ===\\nSculpture played a particular role in Dado\\'s creation, as premises can be seen as early as in 1962 but most works were made in the 2000s until his death. In 1962, Dado\\'s first achievement in sculpture was a pole using cattle bones collected in a knacker\\'s yard.\\nIn 1968, Dado exhibited a Citroën Traction Avant car in the CNAC, Paris. The car wreck appearance was totally changed by a profusion of bones. Dado returned mainly to sculpture in his last decade of creation. In 2009 and under the auspices of Montenegro, a set of 27 sculptures Les Elégies Zorzi was exhibited in the Zorzi palace during the Venice Art Biennale.\\n\\nFrom the mid-1990s to 2000, the artist also explored the use of ceramics as a medium for his creation. A most noticeable achievement in this field is a set of ceramics tiles in tribute to French writer Irène Némirovsky.\\n\\n\\n=== Collection books ===\\nA fervent books collector and reader, Dado found opportunities to work with writers, poets or essayists, who most of time were friends of him. Having met French writer Georges Perec, Dado illustrated Alphabets, a book dedicated to word play (1976). After Georges Perec\\'s death, Dado would work on a second version of the book, mainly consisting in enriched illustrations of the first version.\\nIn 1985, he worked on a series of 9 dry-point engravings to illustrate Le Terrier by Franz Kafka, at the Lacourière-Frélaut workshop.\\nIn 1989, he illustrated Le Bonheur dans le crime by Barbey d\\'Aurevilly published with the Imprimerie nationale. Two important collaborators of Dado were the writers Claude Louis-Combet and Pierre Bettencourt. Bettencourt and Dado produced illustrated versions of Les plus belles Phrases de la Langue française (1990), Voyage sur la Planète innommée (1990) and Les Négriers jaunes (1995).\\nTheir collaboration started in 1984 when Pierre Bettencourt wrote a text for an exhibition catalogue of paintings inspired by Buffon\\'s work. As a son of the teacher of biology, Dado was fascinated by natural science.\\nClaude Louis-Combet, a long-time friend, and Dado produced several books. Some of those texts were specifically written in order to be published with illustrations of Dado. Including those is Les Oiseaux d\\'Irène (2007), a personal tribute of both artists to writer Irène Némirovsky and Dadomorphes & Dadopathes, with 5 engravings by Dado, published with Deyrolles in 1992.\\nIn the 2000s, Dado worked with Jean-Marc Rouillan with the publishing of Les Viscères polychromes de la Peste brune, 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Production design ===\\nIn 1993, Dado took part to the production design of Handel\\'s Tamerlano for the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, direction Jean-Louis Martinoty, conductor Roy Goodman.\\nIn 1996, Dado renewed his experience in production design with the world premiere of Llanto por Ignacio Sanchez of Stavros Xarchakos, based on a poem by Lorca, direction Pierre Jourdan, in the Théatre Impérial de Compiègne, France.\\n\\n\\n=== Digital works ===\\nDado realizes his first digital collages from 1996 in the printing workshop of his sister, Marija. Some of these works will be reproduced later in the Swiss art review Trou.\\nSeveral digital collages based on photographs by Domingo Đurić were shown at the Venice Biennale in 2009. From 2007, Dado devoted himself to the creation of a website with the help of his son-in-law, a virtual antimuseum, The Dado Syndrome.\\nIn 2010, as a virtual museum, for its English version, the website was granted by ICOM permission to use the top-level domain .museum which was limited exclusively to museums until 2018, when AFNIC was designated by ICOM as the world registry operator for .museum and relaxed eligibility rules. The site is trilingual: French/Montenegrin/English.\\n\\n\\n== Dado in public collections ==\\nCentre Pompidou, Musée national d\\'art moderne, Paris, France\\nMusée des Abattoirs, Toulouse, France\\nMusée régional d\\'Art contemporain de la Région Languedoc-Roussillon\\nMOMA, New York, United States\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nDado met his wife Hessie, a Cuban artist, during a trip to New York in 1962. Originally native of the Caribbean, she moved to Hérouval and married him. They raised five children together.\\nThough staying most of the time in his secluded home, Dado occasionally left his place to feed his interest in the outer world. In 1984, he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\\nBesides travelling several times to New York, he had a unique experience joining a team of medical researchers in Central Africa in 1974, spending a month with the Pygmies of the Central African Republic rainforest. Other noticeable experiences were a discovery of India in 1992 and a trip to Guatemala in 1997.\\nInfluence of these trips is reflected in paintings such as the Boukoko triptyque (1974) and Tikal (1998).\\nDado died at the age of 77 in Pontoise near Paris on November 27, 2010.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nJean-Louis Andral, Donations Daniel Cordier.

       "  'Christopher Lee Burden (April 11, 1946 – May 10, 2015) was an American artist working in performance art, sculpture and installation art. Burden became known in the 1970s for his performance art works, including Shoot (1971), where he arranged for a friend to shoot him in the arm with a small-caliber rifle. A prolific artist, Burden created many well-known installations, public artworks and sculptures before his death in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nBurden was born in Boston in 1946 to Robert Burden, an engineer, and Rhoda Burden, a biologist.  He grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, France and Italy.\\nAt the age of 12, Burden had emergency surgery, performed without anesthesia, on his left foot after he was severely injured in a motor-scooter crash on the island of Elba. During the long convalescence that followed, he became deeply interested in visual art, particularly photography.\\nHe studied for his B.A. in visual arts, physics and architecture at Pomona College in 1965–1969 and received his MFA at the University of California, Irvine—where his teachers included Robert Irwin—from 1969 to 1971.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early performance art ===\\nBurden began to work in performance art in the early 1970s. He made a series of controversial performances in which the idea of personal danger as artistic expression was central. His first significant performance work, Five Day Locker Piece (1971), was created for his master\\'s thesis at the University of California, Irvine, and involved his being locked in a locker for five days.\\nHis 1973 work 747 involved the artist firing several pistol shots directly at a Boeing 747 passenger jet plane while it took off from Los Angeles International Airport.  The piece had a single witness, photographer Terry McDonnell, who filmed the act.\\nHis best-known work from that time is perhaps the 1971 performance piece Shoot, in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about sixteen feet (5 m) with a .22 rifle.\\nOther performances from the 1970s included Deadman (1972), in which Burden lay on the ground covered with a canvas sheet and a set of road flares until bystanders assumed he was dead and called emergency services (leading to his arrest); Match Piece (1972) (also known as Match), in which Burden launched lit matches at a naked woman lying between him and a set of two televisions in a room covered with butcher paper (1972); B.C. Mexico (1973), in which he kayaked to a desolate beach in Baja Mexico where he lived for 11 days with no food and only water; Fire Roll (1973), in which he set a pair of pants on fire and then rolled on them to extinguish them; Prelude to 220, or 110, in which he had himself bolted to a concrete floor by copper bands, next to two buckets of water that also contained live 110-volt wires; Honest Labor (1979), in which he dug a large ditch; Velvet Water (1974), in which he spent five minutes attempting to breathe water as a live audience watched; Do You Believe in Television (1976), in which he sent an audience to the third floor of a building — where television monitors showed them the ground floor — and then lit a fire on the ground floor (sources differ as to whether the monitors showed the fire, forcing the audience to realize that the screens represented reality, or showed an intact ground floor, forcing them to realize that the screens did not represent reality); and TV Hijack (1972) wherein, during a live television interview to which he had brought his own camera crew, he held interviewer Phyllis Lutjeans at knifepoint and threatened to kill her if the station stopped live transmission (when asked about the incident in 2015, Lutjeans stated that Burden was a \\'gentle soul\\', that she knew it was an art piece, and that the incident did not damage their pre-existing friendship); to conclude the piece, he demanded to be given the station\\'s recording of the incident, which he then destroyed.\\n\\nOne of Burden\\'s most reproduced and cited pieces, Trans-Fixed took place on April 23, 1974, at Speedway Avenue in Venice, California. For this performance, Burden lay face up on a Volkswagen Beetle and had nails hammered into both of his hands, as if he were being crucified on the car. The car was pushed out of the garage and the engine revved for two minutes before being pushed back into the garage.\\nLater that year, Burden performed his piece White Light/White Heat at the Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York City. For this work of experiment performance and self-inflicting danger, Burden spent twenty-two days lying on a triangular platform in the corner of the gallery. He was out of sight from all viewers and he could not see them either. According to Burden, he did not eat, talk, or come down the entire time.\\nSeveral of Burden\\'s other performance pieces were considered controversial at the time: another \"danger piece\" was Doomed (1975), in which Burden lay motionless in a gallery at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago under a 5 ft × 8 ft (1.5 m × 2.4 m) slanted sheet of glass near a running wall clock. Burden planned to remain in that position until a museum employee prioritized his well-being over the artistic integrity of the piece. After 40 hours, the museum staff consulted physicians. 5 hours and 10 minutes after that, museum employee Dennis O\\'Shea placed a pitcher of water within Burden\\'s reach, at which point Burden rose, smashed the glass, and took a hammer to the clock, thus ending the piece.\\nBy the end of the 1970s, Burden turned instead to vast engineered sculptural installations. In 1975, he created the fully operational B-Car, a lightweight four-wheeled vehicle that he described as being \"able to travel 100 miles per hour and achieve 100 miles per gallon\" (160 km/h and 43 km/L). Some of his other works from that period are DIECIMILA (1977), a facsimile of an Italian 10,000 Lira note, possibly the first fine art print that (like paper money) is printed on both sides of the paper; The Speed of Light Machine (1983), in which he reconstructed a scientific experiment with which to \"see\" the speed of light; and the installation C.B.T.V. (1977), a reconstruction of the first ever made Mechanical television.\\nIn 1978, he became a professor at University of California, Los Angeles, a position from which he resigned in 2005 due to a controversy over the university\\'s alleged mishandling of a student\\'s classroom performance piece that echoed one of Burden\\'s own performance pieces. Burden cited the performance in his letter of resignation, saying that the student should have been suspended during the investigation into whether school safety rules had been violated. The performance allegedly involved a loaded gun, but authorities were unable to substantiate this.\\nIn 1979, Burden first exhibited his notable Big Wheel exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. It was later exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\\nIn 1980, he produced The Atomic Alphabet – a giant, poster-sized hand-colored lithograph – and performed the text dressed in leather and punctuating each letter with an angry stomp. Twenty editions of the work were produced and are largely in the possession of museums, including SFMOMA and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n1988\\'s Samson was a 100-ton hydraulic jack which was connected to a turnstile such that, with each guest who entered the Newport Harbor Art Museum, timbers were rammed into the museum\\'s supporting walls, meaning that \"if enough people entered the museum, it would collapse\". The exhibit was forcibly disassembled by the local fire department after a complaint that it was blocking a fire exit. In 2008, Burden reported having subsequently sold Samson to \"a collector in Brazil\".\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\n\\nMany of Chris Burden\\'s later sculptures are intricate installations and structures consisting of many small parts. A Tale of Two Cities (1981) was inspired by the artist\\'s fascination with war toys, bullets, model buildings, antique soldiers, and a fantasy about the twenty-fifth century – a time when he imagines the world will have returned to a system of feudal states. The room-filling miniature reconstruction of two such city-states, poised for war, incorporates 5,000 war toys from the United States, Japan, and Europe – on a 1,100-square-foot (100 m2), 20-short-ton (18 t) sand base surrounded by a \"jungle\" made of houseplants. The gallery-sized installation All the Submarines of the United States of America (1987) consists of 625 identical, small, handmade, painted-cardboard models that represent the entire United States submarine fleet dating from the late 1890s, when submarines entered the navy\\'s arsenal, to the late 1980s. He suspended the cardboard models on monofilaments from the ceiling, placing them at various heights so that as a group they appear to be a school of fish swimming through the ocean of the gallery space. In 1992, he exhibited his Fist of Light during the Whitney Biennial exhibition in New York. It consisted of a sealed kitchen-sized metal box with hundreds of metal halide lamps burning inside. It required an industrial air conditioner to cool the room.\\nHell Gate (1998), is a 28-foot-long (8.5 m) scale model, in Erector and Meccano pieces and wood, of the dramatic steel-and-concrete railroad bridge that crosses the Hell Gate segment of the East River, between Queens and Wards Island. In 1999, Burden\\'s sculpture When Robots Rule: The Two Minute Airplane Factory was shown at the Tate Gallery in London. It was a \"factory-like assembly line which manufactures rubber-band-powered model aeroplanes from tissue paper, plastic and balsa wood\". Each plane had a propeller powered by a rubber band, and when each was completed, at a rate of one every 2 minutes, the machine launched it to fly up and circle around the gallery. Unfortunately, the machine was non-functional for at least two months of the installation, leading World Sculpture News to question the intent of the piece and remark that \"the work illustrated that robots, in fact, don\\'t rule everything, and for the time being, are still subjected to individual and groups shortcomings\".\\nFirst presented at the Istanbul Biennial in 2001, Nomadic Folly (2001) consists of a large wooden deck made of Turkish cypress and four huge umbrellas. Visitors can relax and linger in this tent-like structure, replete with opulent handmade carpets, braided ropes, hanging glass and metal lamps, and wedding fabrics embroidered with sparkling threads and traditional patterns.\\nIn 2005, Burden released Ghost Ship, his crewless, self-navigating yacht which docked at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 28 July after a 330-mile (530 km) 5-day trip from Fair Isle, near Shetland. The project was commissioned by the company Locus+ at a cost of £150,000, and was funded with a significant grant from Arts Council England, being designed and constructed with the help of the Marine Engineering Department of the University of Southampton. It is said to be controlled via onboard computers and a GPS system; however, in case of emergency the ship is \\'shadowed\\' by an accompanying support boat.\\nIn 2008, Burden created Urban Light, a sculptural work consisting of 202 found antique street lights that had once stood around Los Angeles. He bought the lights from the contractor who installed Urban Light, Anna Justice. The work is on view outside of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the solar-powered lights are illuminated at dusk.\\nIn the summer of 2011, Burden finished his kinetic sculpture, Metropolis II, which took four years to build. It was installed at LACMA in Fall 2011. \"Chris Burden\\'s Metropolis II is an intense kinetic sculpture, modeled after a fast paced, frenetic modern city.\"\\nSuspended from opposite ends of a telescoping balance beam of velvety rusted steel are a restored bright yellow 1974 Porsche sports car and a small meteorite. Porsche With Meteorite (2013) balances perfectly, with the heavier car much closer to the vertical support.\\nLight of Reason was commissioned by Brandeis University in 2014 and stands outside the Rose Art Museum on campus. The sculpture consists of three rows of 24 Victorian lamp posts which point away from the museum\\'s entrance. The sculpture serves as a gateway and outdoor event space, and has become a campus landmark.\\nBurden\\'s last completed project – a working dirigible that flies in perfect circles called Ode to Santos Dumont after the pioneering Brazilian aviator – was unveiled at a private Gagosian Gallery event outside of Los Angeles shortly before his death and later installed as a tribute at LACMA. Also, the New Museum decided to have Twin Quasi-Legal Skyscrapers (2013), two 36-foot-tall towers created for the museum\\'s retrospective on Burden, remain on the institution\\'s roof for several months in tribute. At the time of his death, Burden was also working on a watermill next to Frank Gehry\\'s not then yet completed aluminum tower at LUMA Arles, which was finished in 2021.  Burden\\'s work remained unfinished at the time of his passing as well.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 2013, the New Museum presented \"Chris Burden: Extreme Measures\", an expansive presentation of Burden\\'s work that marked the first New York survey of the artist and his first major exhibition in the United States in over twenty-five years. Burden has also had major retrospectives at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach, California (1988), and the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna (1996). Other solo exhibitions include \"14 Magnolia Doubles\" at the South London Gallery, London (2006); \"Chris Burden\" at the Baltic Center of Contemporary Art, Gateshead (2002); and \"Tower of Power\" at the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna (2002). In 1999 Burden exhibited at the 48th Venice Biennale and the Tate Gallery in London. In the summer of 2008, Burden\\'s 65-foot-tall (20 m) skyscraper made of one million erector set parts, titled What My Dad Gave Me, stood in front of Rockefeller Center, New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nBurden\\'s work is featured in prominent museum collections such as the LACMA and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; the Middelheimmuseum, Antwerp, Belgium; the Inhotim Centro de Arte Contemporanea, Brazil; the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, among others.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nBurden was represented by Gagosian Gallery from 1991 until his death. In 2009, a deal that Gagosian Gallery had struck to buy $3 million in gold bricks for Burden\\'s work One Ton, One Kilo was frozen when it turned out that the bricks had been acquired from a Houston-based company owned by financier Allen Stanford, who was later charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sentenced to 110 years in prison for cheating investors out of more than $7 billion over 20 years in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history. As of 2013, the gallery\\'s gold has been frozen while the SEC investigates Stanford and One Ton One Kilo cannot be mounted until the gold bullion is released.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nDavid Bowie\\'s 1977 song \"Joe the Lion\" was inspired by Burden\\'s 1974 Trans-Fixed, where Burden crucified himself on the roof of a Volkswagen Beetle. Laurie Anderson titled her 1977 song \"It\\'s Not the Bullet that Kills You – It\\'s the Hole (for Chris Burden)\". Burden was also mentioned in the Jeff Lindsay book Dexter by Design, and in Norman Mailer\\'s book The Faith of Graffiti. The poem \"Doomed (1975)\" by David Hernandez in his 2011 collection Hoodwinked describes the Burden installation of the same name in Chicago. In poet Jason Schneiderman\\'s 2020 collection Hold Me Tight there is a sequence about Burden.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nBurden was married to multi-media artist Nancy Rubins. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, California. His studio was located in Topanga Canyon. From 1967 to 1976, Burden was married to Barbara Burden, who documented and participated in several of his early artworks.\\nBurden died on May 10, 2015, 18 months after having been diagnosed with melanoma.

       "  'Jacobus Hermanus Pieters Geers, commonly known as Kendell Geers, is a South African conceptual artist. Geers lives and works in Brussels, Belgium.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nKendell Geers was born in Leondale, a working-class suburb on the East Rand outside Johannesburg, South Africa, into an Afrikaans family during the time of apartheid. \\nAt the age of 15, Geers ran away from home due to an abusive, alcoholic father, and joined the anti-apartheid movement. The apartheid government had a policy of compulsory conscription for white males as young as 16 years old. Geers applied to the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in order to avoid conscription into the South African Defence Force.\\nWhile at art school, Geers met fellow artist Neil Goedhals, and they formed the Performance Art group KOOS with Marcel van Heerden, Gys de Villiers, Megan Kruskal, and Velile Nxazonke. KOOS sang post-punk / industrial music ballads based on Afrikaans protest poetry by poets like Ryk Hattingh and Christopher can Wyk. Although they were included on the Voëlvry compilation album and performed at Die Eerste Afrikaanse Rockfees, KOOS performed only one concert, at the University of the Witwatersrand, as part of The Voëlvry Movement tour. KOOS disbanded in 1990 following the suicide of Neil Goedhals on 16 August, 1990.\\nAt Wits University Geers became an activist working with National Union of South African Students and the End Conscription Campaign. In 1988, he was one of 143 young men who publicly refused to serve in the South African Defense Force and faced a six-year prison sentence as a direct consequence. He left South Africa and went into exile as a refugee in the United Kingdom. From there, he moved to New York City, where he worked as an assistant to artist Richard Prince in 1989.\\nWith the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners Geers returned to South Africa as soon as possible in 1990. He began working as an art critic and curator whilst practicing as an artist. The first work of art he created back on South African soil was called \"Bloody Hell\", a ritual washing of his white Afrikaaner Boer body with his own fresh blood. The essay begins with the words \"I am guilty! I cannot hide my guilt, as it is written all over my face. I was born guilty, without being given the option\" an acknowledgment that one of the artist\\'s ancestors (Carel Frederik Christoffel Geers) was a Boer at the Battle of Blood River. The blood that he washed himself with symbolized an exorcism of his ancestral, cultural and religious heritage. \\nChallenging his Afrikaans family and Boer culture, he changed his date of birth to May 1968 as a political act, reclaiming his identity by destroying the person he was born as (named Jacobus Hermanus Pieter), in order to give birth to himself as the artist Kendell Geers. The act of washing his skin in his own blood was a reference to the line \"My head is bloody, but unbowed\" from the poem Invictus. Whilst incarcerated on Robben Island prison, Nelson Mandela recited this poem to other prisoners. Geers chose May 1968 in recognition of the world’s last great utopian revolution and numerous anti-apartheid protests at the Venice Biennial, which resulted in a boycott that lasted until 1993. The date also refers to the Situationist International movement, and the concept of Détournement in which \"Ultimately, any sign or word is susceptible to being converted into something else, even into its opposite\"\\nShortly after his return from exile, Albie Sachs wrote a seminal essay called “Preparing Ourselves for Freedom” in which he calling on his fellow ANC members to desist from \"saying that culture is a weapon of struggle.\" In response Geers wrote an article for the Star Newspaper in which Geers reversed the challenge by \"saying that the struggle is a weapon of culture.\" He wrote \"All good art is political in the sense that it challenges the ideologies and cultural prejudices of both the viewer and the artist. Political art must be perceived less as a set of predictable subjects and more as a critique of social representations\" Believing that there can be \"No Poetry after Apartheid\" Geers used the alienation he felt in relation to his cultural heritage to create a new practice that he called \"Relational Ethics\" in which he used his experiences as an activist as a weapon to challenge the minimalist aesthetics of Conceptual art. In this period he began using police batons, razormesh, broken glass, gunshots, danger tape and punk style xeroxes in his art. In 1995 he created \"Self Portrait,\" an iconic work that consists of no more than a broken Heineken beer bottleneck. The label remains attached to the broken glass and reads \"Imported from Holland. The Superior Quality.\"\\nIn 1999 Geers took up a one year residence at Solitude Palace in Stuttgart and from there moved to Leipzig, Berlin, Vienna and finally settled in London. Following a deep sense of disillusionment in the art system he decided to take a 12 month sabbatical in which he did not create a single work of art. His plan was to instead read and think about art, life, politics in search of a justification to continue making art. He was however already committed to a solo exhibition curated by Nicolas Bourriaud and Jérôme Sans so he promised that he would exhibit the conclusion of his year long research driven sabbatical at the Palais de Tokyo. The resulting exhibition was called \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and consisted of a single matchstick titled \"The Terrorists Apprentice\" installed in the empty museum. During the opening on the 1 June 2002, a vandal destroyed the matchstick, but it was replaced the following day\\nGeers moved to Brussels in 2003\\n\\n\\n== Methodology ==\\nCurator Clive Kellner described the 1988 - 2000 period of Geers work as political but the artist does not like this label. Instead of declaring what he believes in he prefers to create art that embodies a moral ambiguity that invites the viewer to confront what they believe in and this way there is a dialogue and a transformation. He refers to this as TerroRealism which he defines as \"artists who had grown up in countries that had been torn apart by war, revolution, conflict, crime and genocide created work according to an entirely different set of aesthetic principles. In place of the cool detached passive showroom aesthetics of the white cube shrine, their work was invested with a Reality Principle that sought to disrupt the viewer’s pleasure more than satisfy it.\"\\nGeers is known best for using a variety of images, objects, colors and materials that signal danger in an attempt to examine power structures, social injustices, and establishment values. Geers also uses words as a means to explore the power relations and coding of language the borders of semantics in communicating complex contradictory emotions and states of being. Geers creates disarmingly simple situations, like a single matchstick in an empty museum or a broken bottle of beer, but the simple reading quickly disintegrates within a complex forest of signs. He often compares his work to the scene of a crime in which the viewer must reconstruct what has happened and then try to find their own connection to that understanding.  \"The working process is defined by risk and experiment and yes sometimes I have glorious failures but sometimes what remains is something like the scene of a crime, both attractive and repulsive and the viewer is the detective that must put all the pieces together and decode my intentions.\"\\nMost of Geers\\' artwork showcases in visceral, raw emotion where words fail. He tries to \"create pieces in which viewers have to accept responsibility for their presence in the work of art. They are always free to walk away or move on, but if they decide to engage with work then the process becomes an active one\". Geers\\' works create a physical presence and about performing a specific effect rather than depicting it.\\nGeers centres his work around the limits of experience like ecstasy, fear, desire, love, beauty, sexuality, violence and death because he believes that these extreme experiences are beyond our ability to express in words. The knowledge, fear and theories of that experience are central to most cultures around the world. He is drawn to the taboos that govern our lives because they are beyond our abilities to control, no matter who we presume ourselves to be, rich, poor, illiterate, educated.\\n\\n\\n=== Lost Object ===\\nLost object is an Art Historical term coined by artist Geers to set apart his practice of using existing objects, images or materials. The term is a protest against the term Found Object popularised by Marcel Duchamp. The play on words contrasting Lost with Found is a semantic strategy often used by the artist.\\nAccording to Columbia University Professor Z.S. Strother “He rightfully rejects the use of the term Found Object since it grants megalomaniac power to the last person in a chain of hands contributing to a work\\'s biography: \\'I prefer the concept of the LOST OBJECT because it suggests that there is a history and a context to the object, image or thing BEFORE it is reduced to a work of art.”\\nIn his 1996 essay “The Perversity of my Birth, the Birth of my Perversity” the artist wrote that “Modernism was built upon precisely the same essentialist Christian philosophies and beliefs as Colonialism” and that “In rejecting Colonialism and its protégé Apartheid, I thus have no option but to also reject every element of its ideological and hegemonic machinery including its morality, art and the culture” and so therefore the concept of Found Object is rejected as flawed in a moral association with Colonialism.\\nGeers compares the Modernist concept of the Found Object with the Colonial act of “DISCOVERING” a country, or a continent, that effectively erases centuries of history by disregarding the indigenous people who live there. By the very same logic Duchamp’s act of finding erases the history, ownership, provenance, use, value and context of an object, whereas the designation “Lost Object” implies all former histories and context in the spirit of Guy Debord\\'s concept of Détournement\\nThe Lost Object releases the work of art from the Artist’s ego with an open source participation in the history of the design manufacture, use, ownership and function of the object through symbolic Upcycling. Geers argues that the Found Object cannot exist outside of the quarantine of a White Cube Gallery so Duchamp literally transformed the gallery into an aesthetic zone comparable to hospitals and toilets in which every form of reality is purged like the contaminant of a virus.”\\n\\n\\n== Body of work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early work ===\\nHis early work was influenced by the ideas expressed in his response to Albie Sachs and the idea that \"The Struggle is a Weapon of Art.\" Strongly influenced by the ideas of Léopold Sédar Senghor Geers used his experiences as an anti-apartheid activist to interrogate the reading of Conceptual art from an Afro-Centric perspective. Writing about African Conceptualism for the ground breaking exhibition \"Global conceptualism: points of origin, 1950s-1980s\" at Queens Museum, Okwui Enwezor wrote \"In African art, two things are constantly in operation: the work and the idea of the work. These are not autonomous systems. One needs the other and vice versa. A paraphrase of an Igbo idea will clarify this relationship: where there is something standing which can be seen, there is something else standing next to it which cannot be seen but which accompanies the object. In its material basis, African art is object-bound, but in its meaning and intention it is paradoxically anti-object and anti perceptual, bound by the many ways of conveying ideas whereby speech or oral communication are highly valued\"\\nGeers’ art is an activity located not inside the solitude of the studio but in the rough and tumble world of actions, of political, social, and cultural engagement in what he called a dialogue between art and life. His early work was marked with political violence and the violence of politics. His weaponised art by charging conceptual aesthetics with the ethics of political structures of control that explored the moral and ethical contradictions of the apartheid. He developed a visual vocabulary characterized by provocation using a refined black humour that upcycled charged materials like concrete, security fencing, danger tape, broken glass shards, police batons, handcuffs, profanity, pornography into works of art. By appropriating historical events and ideas, he focused on questions of relationship between individual and society. It was in this context that Geers joined every political party in the period before South Africa’s first democratic elections, from the extreme right-wing to the Communist party. In this way, he expressed his doubts about the fetishization of party politics.\\nHe invented the system of calling his work \"Title Withheld\" in order to politically shift the convention of calling art \"Untitled.\" \"Title Withheld (Refuse)\" was a 1993 sculpture that consisted of black refuse bags in which the political verb to refuse was transformed into the aesthetic garbage (refuse). The 1995 work \"Title Withheld (Boycott)\" was a room in the Johannesburg Art Gallery designed by Colonial architect Sir Edwin Lutyens that had been emptied of its apartheid collection and the bare room exhibited in the spirit of \"The Void\" by Yves Klein. \"With this attack on the institution (and by extension, some of his fellow artists), Geers asserted that art could refuse and resist the ideology of museological practice. Thus, the seemingly empty room questioned the pervasive modernist hunger for market-oriented postcolonial objects. As an amplification of this debate, Title Withheld (Boycott) returns us to the vault of the museum, to its ethnographic storage rooms and holding docks, where art and cultural objects await dispersal into the myriad networks of institutional recontextualization. It is precisely what has been cleared and evacuated from the gallery’s walls that is the subject of this intensely aware intervention.\"\\nHe was one of 27 artists that represented South Africa at the 1993 Venice Biennale curated by Achille Bonito Oliva, the first time since the 1968 anti-Apartheid boycotts that South African artists had been invited. Whilst in Venice, he rose to Infamy as the first artist to urinate into Marcel Duchamp\\'s Fountain (Duchamp).\\n\\n\\n=== Self Portrait ===\\n\"Self Portrait\" is an iconic work created in 1995 that consists of no more than a broken Heineken beer bottleneck. The label remains attached to the broken glass and reads \"Imported from Holland. The Superior Quality.\" Geers believes that every object is more than the sum of its physical parts and is instead the embodiment of an ideology, and a portrait both of its maker and its consumer. The broken bottle of Dutch beer represents the values, and morality of the Boers, convinced that apartheid was a legitimate political system. In rejecting his own ancestors and their totalitarian ideologies, Geers symbolically breaks open the beer bottle in order to set himself free.  Like his ancestors the Boers, Heineken beer was imported into South Africa. The work was exhibited in New York on an exhibition called \"Simunye\\' (\\'We Are One\\')\" in 1996 and happened to be in the cargo hold of TWA Flight 800 that exploded as it was taking off on 17 July 1996 so Geers transformed the unique original into an edition of 12, comparing himself to two six packs of beer. Geers describes the work \"Many people think that I chose Heineken because I actually like beer and more than that, drink Heineken and I have to correct them. Identity is very complex, especially if you are a White African and self-loathing is part of your cultural inheritance. In 1990, when Mandela was released and Apartheid de-legislated, our identity as South Africans was up for grabs. Our history, culture, morality, faith, values and everything that one might normally take for granted, as “identity” was in my case illegitimate. As an African I consider myself an animist and respect my ancestors, but those ancestors are Dutch. The broken bottle of beer speaks of identity as violence, the self as broken, the spirit the bottle once contained has been drunk and all that remains is the garbage of history\" Holland Cotter\\'s The New York Times review said \"Every now and then, political art delivers the kind of epiphany it\\'s supposed to: the one-liner idea that sends out unexpected ripples. Such is the case with a piece by the South African artist Kendell Geers in this stimulating show. He simply places an art-book caption for Marcel Duchamp\\'s Conceptual joke \"Air of Paris\" beside a news photo of police administering oxygen to a victim of a terrorist attack. In the face of this simple reality check, Duchamp\\'s academic gamesmanship collapses into irrelevancy.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\nFollowing his year long sabbatical in 2001/2002 his work increasingly took on a spiritual dimension influenced by Alchemy, Kabbalah, Esoterism, Animism, Tarot and Tantra, whilst maintaining his commitment to Activism. He would later define this evolution as \"AniMystikAktivist\". The shift has been misinterpreted by some as a more poetic phase. Here, Geers transferred his incendiary practice into a post-colonial and increasingly global context, suggesting more universal themes like terrorism, spirituality, and mortality. As such, the artist’s life and work can be said to constitute a living archive composed of political events, photographs, letters, and literary texts that serve as a source of inspiration and represent a continuation of his oeuvre.\\n\\n\\n== Selected work in public collections ==\\n\"Brick\" 1988, Johannesburg Art Gallery, Johannesburg, South Africa\\n\"Hanging Piece\" 1993, Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, Cape Town, South Africa\\n\"T.

The project was conceived as a newspaper exhibition in which artists were invited to create a work of art specifically for the double page centre fold of the weekly newspaper. The exhibition was published on 14 December 1990\\nIn 1992 Geers curated \"A.I.D.S. The Exhibition\" at the Johannesburg ICA inviting 17 artists all under the age of 30 to respond to the AIDS pandemic. Artists included C.J. Morkel, Wayne Barker, Belinda Blignaut, Joachim Schönfeldt, Mallory de Cock, Julie Wajs, Diana Victor\\nBetween 1993 and 1999 Geers worked as the curator and art consult for Gencor which was later bought out by BHP. The collection focused on artists and works of art that were central to the Anti-Apartheid Movement spirit dating from historical artists like Gladys Mgudlandlu, Gerard Sekoto, Walter Battiss, Robert Hodgins, Ezrom Legae and Durant Sihlali to contemporaries like Sam Nhlengethwa, William Kentridge and Penny Siopis. In his introduction essay to the book \"Contemporary South African Art: The Gencor Collection\" Geers explains \"The core of the collection (installed in the lift lobbies) consists of a group of ten works that have been curated thematically to embody the spirit of the time between Nelson Mandela’s release from prison on 11 February 1990 and his eventual election as president on 27 April 1994. This period is unique and will in all likelihood never be matched in South African history again. It was a moment during which the old Nationalist government acknowledged that after 46 years of illegitimate rule, their presence in power would soon be over, together with everything they had stood for. At the same time the African National Congress (ANC) refused to accept responsibility for the country until they had been democratically elected to do so. Finding itself between opposing governments, together with the destabilising efforts of covert governmental organisations, the country fell apart socially, politically, economically and culturally. The legitimacy of the old laws was challenged and contested without new laws having yet been written to replace them. The period was characterised by widespread violence, the proliferation of pornography, prostitution, drugs, gangs, confessions, denials, accusations, murders, abductions and assassinations. Yet at the same time the air was filled with the spirit of renewal, euphoria and optimistic hope concerning the prospect of the first democratic election\" The book included essays by Okwui Enwezor, Olu Oguibe, Colin Richards, Elza Miles, Ashraf Jamal and others.\\nIn 1995 Geers resigned from the curatorial committee of the first Johannesburg Biennale in order to make an application to curate his own exhibition. His choice of title \"Volatile Colonies\" was an amalgamation of the two main themes \"Volatile Alliances\" and \"Decolonising our Minds\" The exhibition positioned itself in opposition to the curatorial concept of Magiciens de la terre on which the Biennial was based. The artists which included Janine Antoni, Hany Armanious, Carlos Capelán, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Philippe Parreno, Paul Ramirez Jonas and Rirkrit Tiravanija were selected \"by their experiences and relationships with the languages of art rather than by their ethnicity. Although able to survive in the centre, they are always aware of their own intrinsic differences in relation to that position. No longer content to be tolerated as victims, they are seizing control of their lives and art by setting trends rather than following. Their ethnic origins and experiences are transformed from an initial disadvantage into a weapon against the languages of art.\"\\n\\n\\n== Social sculptures ==\\nStrongly influenced by the Social sculpture concept of Joseph Beuys and the African art principle of \"African Art as Philosophy\" based on the ideas of Leopold Senghor Geers conception of art evolved with the logic of an expanded field. He believes that Art is he result of Life and Life is the source of Art. \"It’s very important for me that life comes before art, that living and exposing myself to things is a process that happens in my life and in my\\nworld. This process is absolutely necessary, because I don’t believe that I can make art if I have not experienced those things.\"\\nOn the 25 April 2003 he launched RED SNIPER, a performance art music collaboration with Front 242 musician Patrick Codenys. The project was an attempt to find a hybrid space between image and music, working from video clips that were looped, remixed and composed simultaneously from both visual and audio points of view. The sound was composed at the same time the image was edited, creating an audio-visual mix as much about music as it was about video.\\nIn 2009 whilst preparing the work \"Stripped Bare\" for his exhibition \"A Guest Plus a Host = A Ghost\" Geers was struck by the violent beauty of the lead bullets as they opened up like flowers when they hit the glass. He cast one of the exploded bullets into 18kt yellow gold earrings for Elisabetta Cipriani Wearable Art and called the Social Sculpture \"Within Earshot\"\\nIn 2020 Geers designed the A.S. Velasca kits for the season 2020/21.\\n\\n\\n== Manifesto ==\\nIn the preparations for a retrospective that would begin at the South African National Gallery and travel to Haus der Kunst Geers fell out with the curators. He fell into \"a deep depression at the time brought about by the injustices of an art system that cares only about market ranking and price tags. The art system has no use or value for vision, integrity or consequence.\". For a second time in his life, he found himself unable to create, so instead of making art he decided to use his time in search of a reason to justify being an artist. He began a list of reasons that eventually evolved into a manifesto. In trying to come to terms with the illegitimacy of his identity as a working-class Afrikaans white man, Geers authored the Political-Erotical-Mystical Manifesto, bringing together his early political activism with a spiritual consciousness.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nKendell Geers has participated in many international exhibitions and biennials including the Johannesburg Biennale (1995, 1997), Havana Biennale (1994), Istanbul Biennale (2003), Taipei Biennale (2000) Lyon Biennale (2005) Venice Biennale (1993, 2007, 2011, 2017, 2019) Dakar Biennial (2018) Shanghai Biennale (2016) Sao Paolo Biennial (2010) Carnegie International (1999) and Documenta (2002 and 2017). His first retrospective exhibition was called “Irrespektiv” and toured in 2007 from BPS22 (Charleroi Belgium) to SMAK (Gent Belgium), BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art (Newcastle), Musée d\\'art contemporain de Lyon (Lyon France), DA2 Domus Artium (Salamanca, Spain) and MART (Trento, Italy). The second retrospective was organised by Okwui Enwezor in 2013 at the Haus der Kunst (Munich Germany)\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\"Argot\" Chalkham Hill Press, 1993.

       "  'Edward Joseph Ruscha IV (, roo-SHAY; born December 16, 1937) is an American artist associated with the pop art movement. He has worked in the media of painting, printmaking, drawing, photography, and film. He is also noted for creating several artist\\'s books. Ruscha lives and works in Culver City, California.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nRuscha was born into a Roman Catholic family in Omaha, Nebraska, with an older sister, Shelby, and a younger brother, Paul. Edward Ruscha, Sr. was an auditor for Hartford Insurance Company. Ruscha\\'s mother was supportive of her son\\'s early signs of artistic skill and interests. Young Ruscha was attracted to cartooning and would sustain this interest throughout his adolescent years. Though born in Nebraska, Ruscha lived some 15 years in Oklahoma City before moving to Los Angeles in 1956 where he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now known as the California Institute of the Arts) under Robert Irwin and Emerson Woelffer from 1956 through 1960. While at Chouinard, Ruscha edited and produced the journal Orb (1959–60) together with Joe Goode, Emerson Woelffer, Stephan von Huene, Jerry McMillan, and others. As a result, Orb became one of the U.S.\\' first recorded alternative newspapers.\\nIn 1961, Ruscha spent seven months traveling through Europe. After graduation, Ruscha took a job as a layout artist for the Carson-Roberts advertising agency in Los Angeles.\\nBy the early 1960s he was well known for his paintings, collages, and photographs, and for his association with the Ferus Gallery group, which also included artists Robert Irwin, John Altoon, John McCracken, Larry Bell, Ken Price, and Edward Kienholz. He worked as layout designer for Artforum magazine under the pseudonym “Eddie Russia” from 1965 to 1969 and taught at UCLA as a visiting professor for printing and drawing in 1969. He is also a lifelong friend of guitarist Mason Williams.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nRuscha achieved recognition for paintings incorporating words and phrases and for his many photographic books, all influenced by the deadpan irreverence of the Pop Art movement. His textual, flat paintings have been linked with both the Pop Art movement and the beat generation.\\n\\n\\n=== Early influences ===\\nWhile in school in 1957, Ruscha chanced upon then unknown Jasper Johns’ Target with Four Faces in the magazine Print and was greatly moved. Ruscha has credited this artist\\'s work as a source of inspiration for his change of interest from graphic arts to painting. He was also impacted by John McLaughlin\\'s paintings, the work of H.C. Westermann, Arthur Dove’s 1925 painting Goin’ Fishin’, Alvin Lustig\\'s cover illustrations for New Directions Press, and much of Marcel Duchamp’s work. In a 1961 tour of Europe, Ruscha came upon more works by Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, R. A. Bertelli’s Head of Mussolini, and Ophelia by Sir John Everett Millais. Some critics are quick to see the influence of Edward Hopper\\'s Gas (1940) in Ruscha\\'s 1963 oil painting, Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas. In any case, \"Art has to be something that makes you scratch your head,\" Ruscha said.\\n\\n\\n=== Southern California ===\\n\\nAlthough Ruscha denies this in interviews, the vernacular of Los Angeles and Southern California landscapes contributes to the themes and styles central to much of Ruscha\\'s paintings, drawings, and books. Examples of this include the publication Every Building on the Sunset Strip (1966), a book of continuous photographs of a two and one half mile stretch of the 24 mile boulevard. In 1973, following the model of Every Building on the Sunset Strip, he photographed the entire length of Hollywood Boulevard with a motorized camera. Also, paintings like Standard Station (1966), Large Trademark (1962), and Hollywood (1982) exemplify Ruscha\\'s kinship with the Southern California visual language. Two of these paintings, Standard and Large Trademark were emulated out of car parts in 2008 by Brazilian photographer Vik Muniz as a commentary on Los Angeles and its car culture.\\nHis work is also strongly influenced by the Hollywood film industry: the mountain in his Mountain Series is a play on the Paramount Pictures logo; Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights (1962) depicts the 20th Century Fox logo, while the dimensions of this work are reminiscent of a movie screen; in his painting The End (1991) these two words, which comprised the final shot in all black-and-white films, are surrounded by scratches and streaks reminiscent of damaged celluloid. Also, the proportions of the Hollywood print seems to mimic the Cinemascope screen (however, to make the word \"Hollywood\", Ruscha transposed the letters of the sign from their actual location on the slope of the Santa Monica Mountains to the crest of the ridge).\\nRuscha completed Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights in 1961, one year after graduating from college. Among his first paintings (SU (1958–1960), Sweetwater (1959)) this is the most widely known, and exemplifies Ruscha\\'s interests in popular culture, word depictions, and commercial graphics that would continue to inform his work throughout his career. Large Trademark was quickly followed by Standard Station (1963) and Wonder Bread (1962). In Norm’s, La Cienega, on Fire (1964), Burning Gas Station (1965–66), and Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Fire (1965–68), Ruscha brought flames into play. In 1966, Ruscha reproduced Standard Station in a silkscreen print using a split-fountain printing technique, introducing a gradation of tone in the background of the print, with variations following in 1969 (Mocha Standard, Cheese Mold Standard with Olive, and Double Standard).\\nIn 1985, Ruscha begins a series of \"City Lights\" paintings, where grids of bright spots on dark grounds suggest aerial views of the city at night. More recently, his \"Metro Plots\" series chart the various routes that transverse the city of Los Angeles by rendering schematized street maps and blow-ups of its neighborhood sections, such as in Alvarado to Doheny (1998). The paintings are grey and vary in their degrees of light and dark, therefore appearing as they were done by pencil in the stippling technique. A 2003 portfolio of prints called Los Francisco San Angeles shows street intersections from San Francisco and LA juxtaposed one over the other.\\n\\n\\n=== Word paintings ===\\nAs with Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, his East Coast counterparts, Ruscha\\'s artistic training was rooted in commercial art. His interest in words and typography ultimately provided the primary subject of his paintings, prints and photographs. The very first of Ruscha\\'s word paintings were created as oil paintings on paper in Paris in 1961. He began to isolate monosyllables — ACE, BOSS, HONK, OOF — without additional imagery against solid backgrounds.\\nSince 1964, Ruscha has been experimenting regularly with painting and drawing words and phrases, often oddly comic and satirical sayings alluding to popular culture and life in LA. When asked where he got his inspiration for his paintings, Ruscha responded, “Well, they just occur to me; sometimes people say them and I write down and then I paint them. Sometimes I use a dictionary.” From 1966 to 1969, Ruscha painted his “liquid word” paintings: Words such as Adios (1967), Steel (1967–9) and Desire (1969) were written as if with liquid spilled, dribbled or sprayed over a flat monochromatic surface. His gunpowder and graphite drawings (made during a period of self-imposed exile from painting from 1967 to 1970) feature single words depicted in a trompe l’oeil technique, as if the words are formed from ribbons of curling paper. Experimenting with humorous sounds and rhyming word plays, Ruscha made a portfolio of seven mixed-media lithographs with the rhyming words, News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues, News (1970).\\nIn the 1970s, Ruscha, with Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer, among others, began using entire phrases in their works, thereby making it a distinctive characteristic of the post-Pop Art generation. During the mid-1970s, he made a series of drawings in pastel using pithy phrases against a field of color. He also congreagated with artists including George Condo. In the early 1980s he produced a series of paintings of words over sunsets, night skies and wheat fields. In the photo-realist painting Brave Men Run In My Family (1988), part of the artist\\'s \"Dysfuntional Family\" series, Ruscha runs the text over the silhouetted image of a great, listing tall ship; the piece was a collaboration with fellow Los Angeles artist Nancy Reese (she did the painting, he the lettering). In a series of insidious small abstract paintings from 1994 to 1995, words forming threats are rendered as blank widths of contrasting color like Morse code. Later, words appeared on a photorealist mountain-range series which Ruscha started producing in 1998. For these acrylic-on-canvas works, Ruscha pulled his mountain images either from photographs, commercial logos, or from his imagination.\\nFrom 1980, Ruscha started using an all-caps typeface of his own invention named ”Boy Scout Utility Modern” in which curved letter forms are squared-off (as in the Hollywood Sign) This simple font is radically different from the style he used in works such as Honk (1962). Beginning in the mid-1980s, in many of his paintings black or white ‘blanks’ or ‘censor strips’ are included, to suggest where the ‘missing’ words would have been placed. The ‘blanks’ would also feature in his series of Silhouette, Cityscapes or ‘censored’ word works, often made in bleach on canvas, rayon or linen.\\n\\n\\n=== Surrealism ===\\nPaintings like Angry Because It’s Plaster, Not Milk (1965) and Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish (1965) are exemplary works from Ruscha\\'s group of paintings from the mid-1960s that take the strict idea of literal representation into the realm of the absurd. This body of work is characterized by what the artist termed “bouncing objects, floating things,” such as a radically oversized red bird and glass hovering in front of a simple background in the work and have a strong affinity to Surrealism, a recurring theme in the artist\\'s career.  The fish plays a prominent role throughout the series and appears in nearly half of the paintings. Another frequent element is Ruscha\\'s continuous depiction of a graphite pencil – broken, splintered, melted, transformed.\\n\\n\\n=== Odd media ===\\n\\nIn his drawings, prints, and paintings throughout the 1970s, Ruscha experimented with a range of materials including gunpowder, vinyl, blood, red wine, fruit and vegetable juices, axle grease, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, bolognese sauce, cherry pie, coffee, caviar, daffodils, tulips, raw eggs and grass stains. Stains, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in edible substances such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like A Blvd. Called Sunset (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colorings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio Insects (1972) consists of six screen prints – three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine\\'s title in a salad of squashed foods. Ruscha\\'s Fruit Metrecal Hollywood (1971) is an example of the artist\\'s use of unusual materials, this silkscreen of the \"Hollywood\" sign is rendered in apricot and grape jam and the diet drink Metrecal on paper.\\n\\n\\n=== Motifs in light ===\\nNotably different from many of Ruscha\\'s works of the same period, most obviously in its exclusion of text, his series of Miracle pastel drawings from in the mid-1970s show bright beams of light burst forth from skies with dark clouds. An overall glow is created by the black pastel not being completely opaque, allowing the paper to shine through. In the 1980s, a more subtle motif began to appear, again in a series of drawings, some incorporating dried vegetable pigments: a mysterious patch of light cast by an unseen window that serves as background for phrases such as WONDER SICKNESS (1984) and 99% DEVIL, 1% ANGEL (1983). By the 1990s, Ruscha was creating larger paintings of light projected into empty rooms, some with ironic titles such as An Exhibition of Gasoline Powered Engines (1993).\\n\\n\\n=== Commissioned works ===\\nRuscha\\'s first major public commissions include a monumental mural at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (1966) and a seventy-panel, 360-degree work for the Great Hall of Denver Public Library in Colorado (1995). Created as part of a public-art commission, The Back of Hollywood (1976–77) was made from a large sheet of sateen on a billboard and situated opposite the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, designed to be read in the rear-view mirror of a moving car. In 1985 Ruscha was commissioned to design a series of fifty murals, WORDS WITHOUT THOUGHTS NEVER TO HEAVEN GO (a quotation from Hamlet), for the rotunda of Miami–Dade Public Library (now the Miami Art Museum) in Florida, designed by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee.\\nIn 1989, Ruscha decorated a pool for his brother Paul at his house in Studio City, Los Angeles, with a supersized luggage label: on a black tiled background are the words Name, Address and Phone, complete with dotted lines.\\nIn 1998, Ruscha was commissioned to produce a nearly thirty-foot high vertical painting entitled PICTURE WITHOUT WORDS, for the lobby of the Harold M. Williams Auditorium of the Getty Center. He produced another site-specific piece, three 13-by-23-foot panels proclaiming Words In Their Best Order, for the offices of Gannett Company publishers in Tysons Corner, Virginia, in 2002. The artist was later asked by the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum to create two large-scale paintings that flank his A Particular Kind of Heaven (1983), which is in the museum\\'s collection, to form a spectacular, monumental triptych. For his first public commission in New York in 2014, Ruscha created the hand-painted mural Honey, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today for a temporary installation at the High Line.\\nIn 2008, Ruscha was among four text-based artists that were invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to write scripts to be performed by leading actors; Ruscha\\'s contribution was Public Notice (2007). To celebrate the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)\\'s 75th anniversary, Ruscha was one of the artists invited to collaborate with the museum on a limited-edition of artist-designed T-shirts. Ruscha is regularly commissioned with works for private persons, among them James Frey (Public Stoning, 2007), Lauren Hutton (Boy Meets Girl, 1987), and Stella McCartney (Stella, 2001). In 1987, collector Frederick Weisman had Ruscha paint the exterior of his private plane, a Lockheed JetStar. The summer 2012 campaign of L.A.-based fashion label Band of Outsiders featured Polaroid shots of Ruscha. In 2020, Ruscha produced the cover art and typography of Paul McCartney\\'s album McCartney III. In 2022, he teamed up with (RED) and Gagosian Gallery to create a limited-edition silk twill scarf—featuring his drawing Science Is Truth Found (1986)—to help provide more equitable access to COVID-19 relief. In 2023 he created the cover art for the Beatles single \"Now and Then.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\n\\nBetween 1962 and 1978, Ruscha produced sixteen small artist\\'s books:\\n\\nTwentysix Gasoline Stations, 1963\\nVarious Small Fires, 1964\\nSome Los Angeles Apartments, 1965\\nEvery Building on the Sunset Strip, 1966\\nThirtyfour Parking Lots, 1967\\nRoyal Road Test, 1967 (with Mason Williams and Patrick Blackwell)\\nBusiness Cards, 1968 (with Billy Al Bengston)\\nNine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass, 1968\\nCrackers, 1969 (with Mason Williams)\\nReal Estate Opportunities, 1970\\nBabycakes with Weights, 1970\\nA Few Palm Trees, 1971\\nRecords, 1971\\nDutch Details, 1971\\nColored People, 1972\\nHard Light, 1978 (with Lawrence Weiner)\\nLater book projects include:\\n\\nCountry Cityscapes, 2001\\nME and THE, 2002\\nEd Ruscha and Photography, 2004 (with Sylvia Wolf)\\nOH / NO, 2008\\nDirty Baby, 2010 (with Nels Cline and David Breskin)\\nIn 1968, Ruscha created the cover design for the catalogue accompanying a Billy Al Bengston exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For the “Documenta 5\" catalogue in 1972, he designed an orange vinyl cover, featuring a “5” made up of scurrying black ants. In 1978, he designed the catalogue \"Stella Since 1970\" for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Leave Any Information at the Signal, a volume of Ruscha\\'s writings, was published by MIT Press in 2002. In 2010, Gagosian Gallery and Steidl published Ruscha\\'s version of Jack Kerouac\\'s novel On the Road in an edition of 350.\\nRuscha\\'s artist books have proved to be deeply influential, beginning with Bruce Nauman’s Burning Small Fires (1968), for which Nauman burned Ruscha\\'s Various Small Fires and Milk (1964) and photographed the process. More than forty years later, photographer Charles Johnstone relocated Ruscha\\'s Twentysix Gasoline Stations in Cuba, producing the portfolio Twentysix Havana Gasoline Stations (2008). A recent homage is One Swimming Pool (2013) by Dutch artist Elisabeth Tonnard, who re-photographed one of the photographs from Ruscha\\'s Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass (1968) and enlarged it to the size of a small swimming pool, consisting of 3164 pages the same size as the pages in Ruscha\\'s original book. The pages of this ‘pool on a shelf’ can be detached to create the life-size installation.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nPhotography has played a crucial role throughout Ruscha\\'s career, beginning with images he made during a trip to Europe with his mother and brother in 1961, and most memorably as the imagery for more than a dozen books that present precisely what their titles describe. His photographs are straightforward, even deadpan, in their depiction of subjects that are not generally thought of as having aesthetic qualities. His \"Products\" pictures, for example, feature boxes of Sunmaid raisins and Oxydol detergent and a can of Sherwin Williams turpentine in relatively formal still lifes. Mostly devoid of human presence, these photographs emphasize the essential form of the structure and its placement within the built environment. Ruscha\\'s photographic editions are most often based on his conceptual art-books of same or similar name. Ruscha re-worked the negatives of six of the images from his book Every Building on Sunset Strip. The artist then cut and painted directly on the negatives, resulting in photographs that have the appearance of a faded black-and-white film. The Tropical Fish series (1974–75) represents the first instance where the photographic image has been directly used in his graphic work, where Ruscha had Gemini G.E.L.\\'s house photographer Malcolm Lubliner make photographs of a range of common domestic objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Films and documentaries ===\\nIn the 1970s, Ruscha also made a series of largely unknown short movies, such as Premium (1971) and Miracle (1975). With the assistance of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Ruscha arranged in Premium a scenario which he first projected in his photo-book Crackers from 1969 and subsequently transformed into a film which features Larry Bell, Leon Bing, Rudi Gernreich, and Tommy Smothers. Miracle contains the essence of the artist\\'s same-named painting, inasmuch as the story is told of a strange day in the life of an auto mechanic, who is magically transformed as he rebuilds the carburetor on a 1965 Ford Mustang. The movie features Jim Ganzer and  Michelle Phillips. In 1984, he accepted a small role in the film Choose Me directed by his friend Alan Rudolph, and in 2010, he starred in Doug Aitken\\'s film Sleepwalkers. Artist Tom Sachs\\' 2018 short film Paradox Bullets stars Ruscha in the role of a hiker lost in the desert and guided only by the voice of Werner Herzog.\\nRuscha was featured in Michael Blackwood\\'s film documentary American Art in the Sixties. He appeared in L.A. Suggested by the Art of Edward Ruscha, a 1981 documentary by Gary Conklin shot at the artist\\'s studio and desert home. Interviews with Ruscha are included in the documentaries Dennis Hopper: The Decisive Moments (2002), Sketches of Frank Gehry (2005), The Cool School (2008), Iconoclasts (2008), and How to Make a Book with Steidl (2010), among others.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Birth of \"Pop Art\" ===\\nIn 1962 Ruscha\\'s work was included, along with Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Dowd, Phillip Hefferton, Joe Goode, Jim Dine, and Wayne Thiebaud, in the historically important and ground-breaking \"New Painting of Common Objects,\" curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. This exhibition is historically considered one of the first \"Pop Art\" exhibitions in America.\\nRuscha had his first solo exhibition in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1966, Ruscha was included in \"Los Angeles Now\" at the Robert Fraser Gallery in London, his first European exhibition. In 1968, he had his first European solo show in Cologne, Germany, at Galerie Rudolf Zwirner. Ruscha joined the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1970 and had his first solo exhibition there in 1973.\\n\\n\\n=== Retrospectives ===\\nIn 1970 Ruscha represented the United States at the Venice Biennale as part of a survey of American printmaking with an on-site workshop. He constructed Chocolate Room, a visual and sensory experience where the visitor saw 360 pieces of paper permeated with chocolate and hung like shingles on the gallery walls. The pavilion in Venice smelled like a chocolate factory. For the Venice Biennale in 1976, Ruscha created an installation entitled Vanishing Cream, consisting of letters written in Vaseline petroleum jelly on a black wall. Ruscha was the United States representative at the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005, showing the site- and occasion-specific a painting cycle Course of Empire. He was interviewed about the pavilion and its curation by Linda Norden and Donna De Salvo in Sarah Thornton\\'s Seven Days in the Art World.\\nHe has been the subject of numerous museum retrospectives, beginning in 1983 with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (traveling to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the San Antonio Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1989, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2000, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in 2001. In 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney mounted a selection of the artist\\'s photographs, paintings, books and drawings that traveled to the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo, Rome and to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.\\nIn 1998, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles organized a retrospective solely devoted to Ruscha\\'s works on paper. In 2004, The Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited a second Ruscha drawing retrospective, which traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and then to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nIn 1999, the Walker Art Center mounted Edward Ruscha: Editions 1959-1999, a major retrospective of the artist\\'s prints, books, and graphic works, which number well over 300. The show travelled to the LACMA in 2000. Ruscha coauthored the catalogue raisonné with Walker curator Siri Engberg. In July 2012, Reading Ed Ruscha opened at the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria.\\nIn 2006, an exhibition of Ruscha\\'s photographs was organized for the Jeu de Paume in Paris, the Kunsthaus Zürich, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.\\nIn October 2009, London\\'s Hayward Gallery featured the first retrospective to focus exclusively on Ruscha\\'s canvases. Entitled \"Ed Ruscha: Fifty Years of Painting,\" the exhibition sheds light on his influences, such as comics, graphic design, and hitchhiking. The exhibition travelled to Haus der Kunst, Munich, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. “Ed Ruscha: Road Tested,” opened at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas in January 2011. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles prepared an exhibition with Ruscha inspired by Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, which opened in mid-2011 (traveled to Denver Art Museum, Colorado in December 2011 and Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, Florida in May 2012).\\nIn 2016, there was a large 99 piece exhibit of Ruscha\\'s paintings and prints in San Francisco\\'s M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. The exhibit, \"Ed Ruscha and the Great American West,\" focuses primarily on how the artist drew inspiration from the American West. In 1956, Ruscha drove from his home in Oklahoma to Los Angeles where he hoped to attend art school. While driving in a 1950 Ford sedan, the 18 year old artist drew inspiration from dilapidated gas stations, billboards, and telephone poles cross the great expanse of the land. This inspiration from the American West across Route 66 stuck with Ruscha his whole life. The artists paintings of the West reflect both symbolic and ironic renditions of how we imagine the West.\\nIn 2018, The Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas presented \"Ed Ruscha: Archaeology and Romance,\" featuring more than 150 objects drawn from the Ransom Center\\'s Edward Ruscha Papers and Art Collection.\\nFrom September 2023 to January 2024, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City exhibited the retrospective “ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN” featuring over 200 works across mediums, including The Chocolate Room. \\n\\n\\n=== Curating ===\\nIn 2003, Ed Ruscha curated \"Emerson Woelffer: A Solo Flight\", a survey of the work of the late Los Angeles-based Abstract Expressionist, for the inaugural exhibition of the Gallery at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater). In 2012, Ruscha was invited to curate “The Ancients Stole All Our Great Ideas” at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the first exhibition in a series for which internationally renowned artists were invited to work with the national art and natural history collections.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nIn 2000, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, a branch of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, acquired Ruscha\\'s complete graphic archive of 325 prints and 800 working proofs. The museum bought the archive and negotiated for impressions of future prints for $10 million, with funds provided by San Francisco philanthropist Phyllis Wattis. Another major collection of Ruscha\\'s prints was compiled by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2003, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles acquired the Chocolate Room, then worth about $1.5 million. In 2004, the Whitney Museum acquired more than 300 photographs through a purchase and gift from the artist, making it the principal repository of Ruscha\\'s photographic oevre. The gift, purchased from Larry Gagosian, includes vintage photographs that Ruscha took on a seven-month European tour in 1961. In 2005, Leonard A. Lauder purchased The Old Tool & Die Building (2004) and The Old Trade School Building (2005) for the Whitney, both of which were part of \"The Course of Empire: Paintings by Ed Ruscha\" at the Venice Biennale. Ruscha is represented by 33 of his works in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art owns 25 Ruscha paintings, works on paper, and photographs; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has 21 Ruschas in its permanent collection; and the Art Institute of Chicago has more than 40 works by the artist in their collection. Ruscha also has small collections of books and lithographs in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, Utah and in Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art in Montsoreau, France.\\nRuscha\\'s private collectors have in the past included Leonardo DiCaprio, Owen Wilson and Jay-Z.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2001: Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters as a member of the Department of Art, after having previously received its Hassam, Speicher, Betts, and Symons Purchase Fund Award in 1992\\'.\\n2001: Honorary doctorate degree from California College of the Arts\\n2002: amfAR’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS\\n2004: Honorary Royal Academician of London’s Royal Academy of Arts\\n2006: The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh)\\n2008: Aspen Award for Art\\n2008: Honorary doctorate degree from Rhode Island School of Design\\n2009: National Arts Award for Artistic Excellence\\n2009: Honorary doctorate degree from San Francisco Art Institute\\n2013: Named in Time\\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world\\n2013: Honored on the occasion of the Whitney Museum of American Art\\'s annual gala event\\n2019: J. Paul Getty Medal\\n2024: Honorary doctorate from Occidental College.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nFellow artist Louise Lawler included Ruscha in her piece Birdcalls (1972/2008), an audio artwork that transforms the names of famous male artists into a bird song, parroting names such as Artschwager, Beuys, and Warhol in a mockery of conditions of privilege and recognition given to male artists at that time. The muralist Kent Twitchell painted an 11,000-square-foot mural in Downtown Los Angeles to honor Ruscha entitled the Ed Ruscha Monument between 1978 and 1987. The mural was preserved until 2006 when it was illegally painted over. The band Talking Heads Ruscha\\'s eponymous 1974 painting for their \"Sand in the Vaseline\" compilation album. The band Various Cruelties, based around Liam O\\'Donnell, was named after Ruscha\\'s painting of the same name of 1974.\\nBetween 2006 and 2012, Ruscha served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles where he had previously been included in eight special exhibits. In 2012, he was the honoree of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s Art + Film gala; in a speech, the museums\\'s director Michal Govan paid tribute to the artist, quoting the novelist J. G. Ballard: “Ed Ruscha has the coolest gaze in American art.” Ruscha was elected to a three-year term on the board of trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2013. From 2015 until 2019, Ruscha also served on the board of Desert X; he resigned over the board\\'s decision to collaborate on an exhibition in Saudi Arabia.\\nIn 2009, Ruscha\\'s I Think I’ll... (1983) from the collection of the National Gallery was installed at the White House. In 2010, during British prime minister David Cameron\\'s first visit to Washington, President Barack Obama presented him with a signed two-color lithograph by Ruscha, Column With Speed Lines (2003), chosen for its red, white and blue colors. Obama gave Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott a similar lithograph during his visit to the White House in 2014. Ruscha\\'s Screaming in Spanish (2013) was installed in the entry hall of the residence of the United States Ambassador to Spain in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nAs early as 2002, the oil on canvas word painting Talk About Space (1963), a takeoff on the American billboard in which a single word is the subject, was expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million from a private European collection. It was eventually sold for $3.5 million at Christie\\'s in New York, a record for the artist. In 2008, Eli Broad acquired Ruscha\\'s \"liquid word\" painting Desire (1969) for $2.4 million at Sotheby\\'s, which back then was 40 percent under the $4 million low estimate. A navy blue canvas with the word Smash in yellow, which Ruscha painted in 1963, was purchased by Larry Gagosian for $30.4 million at a 2014 Christie\\'s auction in New York. His word painting Hurting the Word Radio #2 (1964) sold by L.A. collectors Joan and Jack Quinn to an anonymous bidder at Christie\\'s for a record-shattering $52.5 million with fees in 2019.\\nAngry Because It’s Plaster, Not Milk from 1965, which had been shown at Ferus Gallery that year, was sold by Halsey Minor to Gagosian Gallery for $3.2 million at Phillips de Pury & Company, New York, in 2010. From the same series, Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish (1965) made $4.1 million at Christie\\'s New York in 2011.\\nRuscha\\'s classic prints, published as multiples, command up to $40,000 apiece.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nRuscha is married to the former Danica Knego (known as Danna). They met in 1965, wed in 1967, separated in 1972, filed for divorce in 1976, divorced in 1978, and remarried in 1987. The couple has two children, Edward \"Eddie\" Ruscha Jr., a son, and Sonny Bjornson, a daughter. In the late seventies, Ruscha bought land about ten miles from Pioneertown, California; he later built a house there.\\nDuring the time he and Danna were apart, Ruscha dated actresses Candy Clark, Samantha Eggar, Diane Keaton, Lauren Hutton, and Michelle Phillips.\\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Ruscha donated $12,500 to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton in September 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn 2011, the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute acquired over seventy photographs by Ruscha as well as his \"Streets of Los Angeles\" archive, including thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera. A portion of the material will go to the Getty as a promised gift from the artist. The \"Streets of Los Angeles\" archive acquired by the Getty Research Institute begins with the photographic and production material for Ruscha\\'s landmark 1966 book Every Building on the Sunset Strip, and includes the original camera-ready three-panel maquette used for the publication. This ongoing project subsequently evolved into a vast photographic archive that spans over four decades and documents many major Los Angeles thoroughfares, including Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and Pacific Coast Highway, shot in 1974 and 1975, and more than 25 other Los Angeles streets that Ruscha photographed since 2007. In total, the archive comprises thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera.\\nIn 2013, the Harry Ransom Center acquired a Ruscha archive comprising five personal journals filled with preliminary sketches and notes; materials related to the making of his artist\\'s book On The Road (2010); notes, photographs, correspondence and contact sheets relating to the creation and publication of his many other artist\\'s books; and materials relating to his short films Miracle (1975) and Premium (1971); his portfolios; and several art commissions. Ruscha himself donated a substantial portion of the archive to the Ransom Center.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nJohn Coplans, \"New Paintings of Common Objects\", Artforum, November, 1962.

       "  'Michael James Aleck Snow  (December 10, 1928 – January 5, 2023) was a Canadian artist who worked in a range of media including film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music. His best-known films are Wavelength (1967) and La Région Centrale (1971), with the former regarded as a milestone in avant-garde cinema.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nMichael James Aleck Snow was born in Toronto on December 10, 1928. He studied at Upper Canada College and the Ontario College of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in 1957. Snow exhibited with the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto throughout the 1960s, becoming even more involved with the gallery upon his return to Toronto in 1971. In the early 1960s Snow moved to New York with his wife, artist Joyce Wieland, where they remained for nearly a decade.  For Snow this move resulted in a proliferation of creative ideas and connections and his work increasingly gained recognition. He returned to Canada in the early 1970s \"an established figure, multiply defined as a visual artist, a filmmaker, and a musician.\"\\nHis work has appeared at exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America. Snow\\'s works were included in the shows marking the reopening of both the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2000 and the MoMA in New York in 2005. In March 2006, his works were included in the Whitney Biennial.\\nSnow\\'s first wife was fellow artist Joyce Wieland, whom he married in 1956. The couple moved to New York City in 1963, but they moved back to Toronto about a decade later and divorced in 1976. In 1990, he married curator and writer Peggy Gale, and they had one son. He was the uncle of filmmaker and video artist Su Rynard.\\nSnow died from pneumonia in Toronto on January 5, 2023, at the age of 94.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Films ===\\nSnow is considered one of the most influential experimental filmmakers of all time. Annette Michelson, in writing about Snow, his 1967 film Wavelength, and his films in general, speaks of the impact of Snow\\'s films, placing viewers in a \"position to more fully understand the particular impact of Snow\\'s filmic work from 1967 on, to discern the reasons for the large consensus given\" to Wavelength when it was honoured with the Grand Prize at the 1967 Experimental Film Festival EXPRMNTL 4 in Knokke, Belgium, and that \"Wavelength, [appears] as a celebration of the \\'apparatus\\' and a confirmation of the status of the subject, and it is in those terms that we may begin to comprehend the profound effect it had upon the broadest spectrum of viewers....\" Wavelength has been the subject of numerous retrospectives internationally. Film scholar Scott MacDonald says of Snow that \"[f]ew filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant-garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose Wavelength is probably the most frequently discussed \\'structural\\' film.\"\\nWavelength has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada and was named #85 in the 2001 Village Voice critics\\' list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century  .\\nSnow\\'s films have premiered in film festivals worldwide and five of his films have premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). In 2000, TIFF commissioned Snow, along with Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, to make a series of short films collectively titled Preludes, for the 25th Anniversary of the festival.\\nIn his Village Voice review of Snow\\'s 2002 film *Corpus Callosum, J. Hoberman writes that Snow\\'s films are \"[r]igorously predicated on irreducible cinematic facts [and] Snow\\'s structuralist epics—Wavelength and La Région Centrale—[announce] the imminent passing of the film era. Rich with new possibilities, *Corpus Callosum heralds the advent of the next. Whatever it is, it cannot be too highly praised.\" *Corpus Callossum was screened at the Toronto, Berlin, Rotterdam, and Los Angeles film festivals amongst others. In January 2003, Snow won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association\\'s Douglas Edwards Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award for *Corpus Callosum.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nOriginally a professional jazz musician, Snow has a long-standing interest in improvised music, as indicated by the soundtrack to his film New York Eye and Ear Control. As a pianist, he has performed solo and with other musicians in North America, Europe and Japan. Snow performed regularly in Canada and internationally, often with the improvisational music ensemble CCMC and has released more than a half dozen albums since the mid-1970s. In 1987, Snow issued The Last LP (Art Metropole), which purported to be a documentary recording of the dying gasps of ethnic musical cultures from around the globe including Tibet, Syria, India, China, Brazil, Finland and elsewhere, with thousands of words of pseudo-scholarly supplementary notes, but was, in fact, a series of multi-tracked recordings of Snow himself, who gave the joke away only in a single column of text in the disc\\'s gatefold jacket, printed backwards and readable in a mirror.  One track, purported to be a document of a coming-of-age ritual from Niger, is a pastiche of Whitney Houston\\'s song \"How Will I Know.\"\\nSnow, with Richard Serra, James Tenney and Bruce Nauman, performed Steve Reich\\'s Pendulum Music on May 27, 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Other media ===\\n\\nBefore Snow moved to New York in 1963, he began a long-term project that for six years would be his trademark: the Walking Woman. Martha Langford in Michael Snow: Life & Work describes this work as employing a single form that offered an infinite number of creative possibilities, the figure itself perceived variably as \"a positive (a presence to be looked at) and a negative (an absence to be looked through).\" His 1962 work Four to Five consisted of a grid of photographs of the Walking Woman placed in Toronto streets and subway stations, inviting the viewer to consider how public space transforms the sculpture.\\nLangford identifies duality as a guiding principle in Snow’s work. By combining materials and methods Snow creates hybrid objects that often defy classification. A work which exemplifies Snow\\'s testing of stylistic boundaries is his 1979 installation Flight Stop (also titled Flightstop), a site-specific work in Toronto\\'s Eaton Centre mall, which looks like a sculptural representation of sixty geese, but is in fact an intricate combination of fibreglass forms and photographs of a single goose.\\nIn 1982, Snow sued the corporate owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre for violating his moral rights by altering Flight Stop. In the landmark case Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd, the Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist\\'s right to the integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow\\'s moral rights by putting Christmas bows on the work.\\nSnow\\'s works have been in Canadian pavilion at world fairs since his Walking Women sculpture was exhibited at Expo 67 in Montréal. He was chosen to represent Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1970; this was the first solo exhibition held at the Biennale\\'s Canadian Pavilion. His bookwork BIOGRAPHIE of the Walking Woman / de la femme qui marche 1961-1967 (2004) was published in Brussels by La Lettre vole. It consists of images of the public appearances of his globally famous icon.\\nAnarchive2: Digital Snow describes Michael Snow as \"one of the most significant artists in contemporary art and cinema of the past 50 years.\" This 2002 DVD was initiated by Paris’ Centre Pompidou and was produced with the support of la foundation Daniel Langlois, Université de Paris, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council, Téléfilm Canada and Montreal’s Époxy. It is an encyclopedia of Snow\\'s works across media, browsed in a manner inimitably and artfully created by Snow. Its 4,685 entries include film clips, sculpture, photographs, audio and musical clips, and interviews.\\n\\n\\n== Retrospectives and honours ==\\n\\nIn 1993, The Michael Snow Project, lasting several months, was a multivenue retrospective of Snow’s works in Toronto exhibited at several public venues and at the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Power Plant. Concurrently his works were the subjects of four books published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Snow has shown internationally in both galleries and cinemas, including a retrospective of his work at the British Film Institute, London where his celluloid works were shown in the cinemas and his digital works in the gallery (The BFI Gallery). The project, titled \\'Yes Snow Show\\', took place in 2009 and was co-curated by Elisabetta Fabrizi and Chris Meigh-Andrew.\\nIn 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2007 \"for his contributions to international visual arts as one of Canada’s greatest multidisciplinary contemporary artists\". In 2000 he was one of the seven first winners of the Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts.\\nIn 2004, the Université de Paris I, Panthéon-Sorbonne awarded him an honorary doctorate. The last artist so awarded was Pablo Picasso.\\nIn 2006, Lima\\'s Museum of Art (MALI) held a selective retrospective exhibition as well as a screening of his films in Peru, as part of the Vide/Art/Electronic Festival.\\n\\n\\n=== Honorary degrees ===\\nUniversité de Paris I, Panthéon-Sorbonne (2004), Emily Carr Institute, Vancouver (2004) Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax (1990), University of Toronto (1999), University of Victoria (1997), Brock University (1975).\\n\\n\\n=== Academic appointments ===\\n\\nVisiting Artist/Professor at MAPS (Master of Art in Public Sphere), Ecole Cantonale d’Art du Valais, Sierre, Switzerland (February 2005, January 2006)\\nVisiting Artist/Professor at L’école Nationale Supérieure d’Art de Bourges, France.

       "  'Lynda Benglis (born October 25, 1941) is an American sculptor and visual artist known especially for her wax paintings and poured latex sculptures. She maintains residences in New York City, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Kastellorizo, Greece, and Ahmedabad, India.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBenglis was born on October 25, 1941, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. She is Greek-American. As a young child and in her early 20s, Benglis often traveled with her grandmother to Greece. She later described these travels as having been important to her work. In her 2015 interview with Ocula Magazine, the artist said that her grandmother was a significant feminist icon for her:Her husband died very early—1955. I was the first female grandchild—which is very important in Greece, as the women inherit the property. She was my godmother, as well as my grandmother.\\nMy grandmother travelled in her forties, and this was unusual and it impacted the way I was. It set a standard for me.Growing up, her father Michael ran a building-materials business. Her mother was from Mississippi and was a preacher\\'s daughter. She is the eldest of five children.\\nBenglis attended McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana. She earned a BFA degree in 1964 from Newcomb College in New Orleans, which was then the women\\'s college of Tulane University, where she studied ceramics and painting. Following graduation, she taught third grade at Jefferson Parish, in Louisiana. In 1964, Benglis moved to New York. Here she came in contact with many of the influential artists of the decade, such as Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Eva Hesse, and Barnett Newman. She went on to study painting at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. There she met the Scottish painter Gordon Hart, who was briefly to be her first husband. Benglis later stated that she married Hart to help him avoid the draft. She also took a job as an assistant to Klaus Kertess at the Bykert Gallery before moving on to work at the Paula Cooper Gallery. In 1979 she met her life partner, Anand Sarabhai, the son of her hosts on a trip she made to Ahmedabad, India. Sarabhai died in February 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nBenglis\\'s work is noted for an unusual blend of organic imagery and confrontation with newer media incorporating influences such as Barnett Newman and Andy Warhol.  Her early work used materials such as beeswax before moving on to large polyurethane pieces in the 1970s and later to gold-leaf, zinc, and aluminum.  The validity of much of her work was questioned until the 1980s due to its use of sensuality and physicality.\\n\\nBenglis\\' latex and polyurethane pours of the late 1960s and 1970s marked her entry into the New York art world. At the same time, she was also working on \"small encaustic relief paintings\".\\nLike other artists such as Yves Klein, Benglis\\'s work resembled Jackson Pollock\\'s flinging and dripping methods of painting.  Works such as Fallen Painting (1968) inform the approach with what could be read as a feminist perspective.  For this work, Benglis smeared Day-Glo paint across the gallery floor invoking \"the depravity of the \\'fallen\\' woman\" or, from a feminist perspective, a \"prone victim of phallic male desire.\" In her work Contraband (1969), she removed the use of a canvas altogether and created her work directly on the floor. These brightly colored organic floor pieces work to disrupt the male-dominated minimalism movement with their suggestiveness and openness.\\n\\nThe structure of the new medium itself played an important role in addressing questions about female identity in relation to art, pop culture, and dominant feminism movements at the time.\\nIn the 1970s, she turned to video as an extension of her sculptural work, producing over a dozen works between 1972 and 1977. Benglis dove into metal casting in the mid 1980s, most notably a series of public fountain projects.\\nBenglis has been a professor or visiting artist at the University of Rochester (1970-1972), Princeton University (1975), University of Arizona (1982), School of Visual Arts (1985-1987).\\n\\n\\n=== Artforum advertisement ===\\n\\n\\n==== History ====\\n\\nBenglis felt underrepresented in the male-run artistic community and so confronted the \"male ethos\" in a series of magazine advertisements satirizing pin-up girls, Hollywood actresses, and traditional depictions of nude female models in canonical works of art.  Benglis chose the medium of magazine advertisements as it allowed her complete control of an image rather than allowing it to be run through critical commentary.  This series culminated with a particularly controversial one in the November 1974 issue of Artforum featuring Benglis posing with a large plastic dildo and wearing only a pair of sunglasses promoting an upcoming exhibition of hers at the Paula Cooper Gallery. Benglis paid $3,000 for the Artforum ad. One of her original ideas for the advertisement had been for her and collaborative partner Robert Morris to work together as a double pin-up, but eventually found that using a double dildo was sufficient as she found it to be \"both male and female.\"  Morris, too, put out an advertisement for his work in that month\\'s Artforum which featured himself in full \"butch\" S&M regalia.\\n\\n\\n==== Theory ====\\nIn this unmaking of the tradition of the passive female nude, Benglis was working in dialogue with popular discourse about gender and gender performativity published at the time of its execution. In particular, Benglis appears to be undermining June Wayne\\'s theory of the \"demonic myth\" in which males, in assuming their gender identity, are responsible to a similar posturing and performativity as women, but instead of upholding \"feminine\" values of passivity, modesty, and gentility, they embody a guise of compensatory hyper-masculinity and heroic bravado. By adopting a phallus, Benglis physically and symbolically muddies the distinction made between these two types of gender performativity and ultimately overturns them, resulting in a positive assertion of femininity\\'s sexual and cultural power.\\n\\n\\n==== Reception and criticism ====\\nArtist Barbara Wagner claims that Benglis shows that even with the appropriation of the phallus as a Freudian sign of power, it does not cover her female identity and still emphasizes a female inferiority.  Rosalind Krauss and other Artforum personnel attacked Benglis\\'s work in the following month\\'s issue of Artforum describing the advertisement as \"exploitative\" and \"brutalizing\".  Critic Cindy Nemser of The Feminist Art Journal dismissed the advertisement as well, claiming that the picture showed that Benglis had \"so little confidence in her art that she had to resort to kinky cheesecake to push herself over the top.\"  Morris\\'s advertisement, however, generated little commentary, providing evidence for Benglis\\'s view that male artists were encouraged to promote themselves, whereas women were chastised for doing so. Benglis eventually cast five lead sculptures of the dildo that she posed with on the Artforum cover, each entitled Smile, one for each of the Artforum editors who wrote in to complain about her ad.\\nIn 2019, The New York Times cited the work as one of the 25 works of art that defined the contemporary age.\\n\\n\\n=== Retrospectives, exhibitions, and surveys ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2009 Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) Retrospective ====\\nBenglis\\'s work was greatly neglected for a long time. However, in 2009, a 40-year retrospective organized by the Irish Museum of Modern Art served to recognize her career. The exhibit showed her in her true light as a main figure in contemporary art. Not only did it show her vast amount of her work, it showed her enthusiasm to take on charged subjects. The exhibition focused on the 1960s and 1970s, when her work was most involved with the link between painting and sculpture. It included the lozenge-shaped wall pieces of built up multicolored wax layers that Benglis started making in 1966 with which she honored Jackson Pollock\\'s famous drip methods. It also included her knotted bowtie shaped wall reliefs of the 1970s and some of her videos. Her work from the 1980s and 1990s was also shown, represented by a few of her famous pleats, which involved her spraying liquid metal onto chicken wire skeletons, and two videos from each of the decades.\\nIn the stateside versions of the show more works from the 1980s and 1990s were shown including her ceramics. These pieces were made of clay and hand molded so that the viewers could feel the making of them- the extorting, folding, and throwing of the moist resistant material. Glazes seemed to be flung on in a causal manner, which brings to mind the abstract expressionism movement of art in which Benglis is involved. The ceramic pieces have a handmade quality that effect the senses both desire driven and dismal, while the colors suggest the glitz of commercial culture.\\nConcentrating on Benglis\\'s early work, the curators gave her a main position in the diverse art of the 70\\'s, a time period that is seen as laying the groundwork for the wide range of expression that continues to grow to this day. Benglis\\'s willingness and ability to mix up gendered tropes with her heroic scales and sparkly colorful finishes while laughing irreverently at views of every moral stripe set her apart from the common customs of feminism and the sexism of the art world. Her work is also deemed important for its meticulous grounding in process and materials used. Each piece produces its own physical understanding. \"They provoke visceral reactions while playfully welcoming open ended associations and ambiguities.\"\\n\\n\\n==== 2011 Show at the New Museum ====\\nIn 2011, The New Museum organized a four-decade exhibition of Benglis\\'s sculptural works with supplementary videos, Polaroids, and magazine clippings. The show received high praise in the New Yorker magazine, which warned viewers to \"prepare to be floored.\"\\n\\n\\n==== 2015 The Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield, UK ====\\nIn 2015, The Hepworth Wakefield presented Benglis\\' first museum retrospective in the UK. It included over 50 works from across her career, and was structured around the influence of place on Benglis’ work, in particular her homes and studios in New York, New Mexico, Greece and India. Curated by Andrew Bonacina, it was described by Guardian critic Adrian Searle as \"a revelation.\"\\n\\n\\n==== 2012 Thomas Dane Gallery in London ====\\nThis subsequent survey focused on the exploratory breadth of materials Benglis experimented with over the course of her career: polyurethane foam, glass, enamel, stainless steel, beeswax, and poured latex. It was her first major survey in the UK.\\n\\n\\n==== 2015 Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, New York ====\\nLynda Benglis: Water Sources was the first exhibition centered around the outdoor water fountains that Benglis has developed since the early 1980s. More broadly, this presentation took as its point of departure the interest in water and landscape that Benglis has explored throughout the last thirty years of her career.\\n\\n\\n==== 2016 Cheim & Read in New York ====\\nIn this new work presented at Cheim & Read Gallery in New York, Benglis turned to handmade paper, which she wrapped around thick wire armatures, often painting the sand-tone surface in bright, metallic colors offset by strokes of deep, coal-based black. At other times the paper was left virtually bare. As Nancy Princenthal writes in her essay published in the accompanying exhibition catalogue, these works reflect the environment in which they were made, the \\'sere and windblown\\' landscape of Santa Fe, New Mexico. As a counterweight to the paper sculptures, Benglis also exhibited \"The Fall Caught\", a large-scale aluminum work made by applying spray foam instead of strips of handmade paper on the chicken wire armature, as well as a new series of spiraling, hand-built black ceramics called \"Elephant Necklace\".\\n\\n\\n==== 2016 Thomas Brambilla gallery in Bergamo, Italy ====\\nIn December 2016, Lynda Benglis had her very first solo show in Italy, titled \"Benglis and the Baroque\", at Thomas Brambilla gallery. The exhibition included a series of large scale marble Torsos specially made for the show. \"Benglis and the Baroque\" explored Benglis\\' long-held interest in Baroque sculpture; much like Gianlorenzo Bernini, Benglis seeks to freeze the intensity of the moment and merge beauty and sensuality in spectacular frozen gestures. Benglis\\' attention to materials and ongoing research into the \"extravagant\" are in full agreement with Baroque poetics.\\n\\n\\n==== 2016 Bergen Assembly in Bergen, Norway ====\\nThroughout 2016, the Bergen Assembly in Bergen, Norway presented a cycle of events, publications, and exhibitions on the artistic practice of Lynda Benglis. Curated by Rhea Dall and Kristine Siegel, PRAXES Center for Contemporary Art.\\n\\n\\n==== 2016 Museo International del Barroco in Puebla, Mexico ====\\nThe Government of Puebla presented the work of Lynda Benglis as the second temporary exhibition, \"Cuerpos, Materia y Alma: Las Esculturas de Lynda Benglis\", at the International Museum of the Baroque. The exuberant forms, folds and contortions, variety of materials, textures and colors, in addition to the size of sculptures, expressed a new sensibility in neobaroque art: contemporary, daring and dynamic. Benglis\\'s purpose was to engage in a dialogue with the architecture of Toyo Ito, the Museum\\'s designer, and to express her fondness for Mexico.\\n\\n\\n==== 2019 Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art in Athens, Greece ====\\nNEON Organization for Culture and Development organized Lynda Benglis\\'s first solo museum exhibition in a country that has played a major role in her life and vision: Greece. The exhibition Lynda Benglis: In the Realm of the Senses  unites 36 of the artist’s singular creations, spanning half a century from 1969 onwards.\\n\\n\\n==== 2022 Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas ====\\nThe Nasher Sculpture Center\\'s 2022 summer exhibition titled Lynda Benglis \"highlights three bodies of work in media as diverse as traditional bronze and decorative glitter.\" The exhibition highlights some of Benglis\\' more recent artistic creations.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations ===\\nBenglis created a series of prints as part of a collaboration with master printer Stan Baden with the Print Research Institute of North Texas at the University of North Texas.\\n\\n\\n=== Video work ===\\nDuring the 1970s, Benglis engaged in dialogues relating to the feminist movement through her art by pioneering a radical body of video work made up of fifteen videos. She turned to video art in 1971 in order to explore a media that could more easily communicate her feminist politics. Benglis\\' performance-based videos confront issues of gender and identity by referencing the societal representation and construction of women and their sexuality as well as the interaction between viewer and artist, self and ambiguity. Though Benglis\\' sculptures reference sexuality through subtly eroticized materials and forms, her video work approaches the subject conceptually and more explicitly.\\nBenglis\\'s interest in human form found in her sculptural work is made present in her videos in through the consistent theme of self-reflexivity. Video offers a direct representation of a figure, a history of popular culture, and a way to illustrate bodies interacting in space, making it useful for feminist discourse. Benglis employs various technical manipulations of video as a medium to complicate the boundaries of visual form and highlight mediations of the self, including a recursive technique by filming television screens playing videos that she had filmed previously, often several layers deep. By doing so, she further exposes the interface between inner and outer realities by using and reproducing her own body and its image through video manipulations, interacting with her own image and voice, and confusing the viewer\\'s perception of time and space. Consequently, Benglis\\'s work destabilizes what are traditionally believed to be video\\'s \"inherent properties\" such as liveness and \"real\" time, spatial orientation and relations, and separation of creator and creation.\\nIn 1971, Benglis began to collaborate with Robert Morris, and produced her first video work, Mumble (1972). Morris\\'s Exchange (1973) also came out of this collaboration. Mumble features figures arranged in space across several screens. Often, the artist will announce the relation from them to the person from off camera, sometimes calling them multiple different names and labeling them with different, incompatible roles. The viewer becomes distrustful of the narrator, calling into question the role and authority of any voiceover speech. Other statements in this video are descriptions such as \"Robin is weaving in the studio downstairs,\" and \"the phone is ringing.\" The straightforward nature of these statements stands in contrast to the confusion created by the recursive screens. The viewer has no way of knowing if the phone is ringing while the artist is filming the final video, or when she was filming Morriss in the very bottom layer, or the layer in between. The warped sense of time and space works to question the privilege of visuality in such a strongly visual culture, offering a critique of television as a medium as well as the potential truthfulness of any image.\\nBenglis completed four other videos in 1972, namely Noise, Document, Home Tapes Revised, and On Screen. All feature her recursive screen technique. Document and On Screen feature particularly strong feminist themes, and both feature the artist directly. Document features a progression undergone by the artist from directed to director, finishing with her writing copyright information juxtaposed to her own image. In this way, she reclaims and maintains control of her image, a feminist act for a female artist. Similarly, On Screen shows the artist making faces at the camera in recursive layers of video. She performs expressions reminiscent of ones that people make in a mirror when no one is looking, and then magnifies it threefold through repetition. In this way, she blocks the potential interpretation of her image and emotional state being present for others.\\nOne of her own more noted videos is Female Sensibility (1973), which shows the artist kissing and licking the face of fellow artist Marilyn Lenkowsky. Many other of Benglis\\'s earlier solo films are highly technically manipulated, edited, and re-taped, thus blending present and past video sequences and selves to enhance the feeling of artifice. For instance, in Now (1973) the artist\\'s face is recursively featured, but this time the self-evidencing frame of the television is cropped out. The artist superimposes a video of herself yelling commands such as \"Now!\" and \"Start recording!\" over an older video of herself apparently echoing the shout, blurring the line between documentary and performance while also making it difficult to tell which image of the artist is present, which is past, and which of these is therefore truly performing.\\nIn  Noise (1972) Benglis employs mechanical reproduction and through looped feedback tapes. Throughout Noise, she plays over several generations of similar taped images and soundtracks to introduce increasing amounts of distortion. The conversion of the looped and layered aural and visual components highlights the boundaries of intelligibility, resulting in the disassociation of sound and image. In On Screen (1972) Benglis visually implicates infinite regression of time and space, similarly manipulating generations of videotapes to confound the viewer\\'s sense of time. The sequence of creation, presented as a gendered self-portrait, is heavily obscured by the layered repetition of aural and visual components. Through this exercise of audiovisual desynchronization, the notions of \"original self\" and \"original production\" are complicated by the layers of self-images presented simultaneously with layers of \"self\". In doing so, Benglis emphasizes that video as a medium is based upon mechanical reproduction, thus subverting the classical notion of authenticity and reproduction in fine art.\\n\\n\\n=== Selected works ===\\nLynda Benglis\\' works distributed by the Video Data Bank include:\\n\\nThe Amazing Bow Wow (1976), 30:07 min, color, sound\\nCollage (1973), 9:30 min, color, sound\\nDiscrepancy (1973), 13:44 min, black and white, sound\\nDocument (1972), 6:08 min, black and white, sound\\nEnclosure (1973), 07:23 min, black and white, sound\\nFemale Sensibility (1973), 13:05 min, color, sound\\nThe Grunions are Running (1973), 5:41, black and white, sound\\nHome Tape Revised (1972), 28:00 min, black and white, sound\\nHow\\'s Tricks (1976), 34:00 min, color, sound\\nMonitor (1999), 00:20 min, color, sound\\nMumble (1972), 20:00 min, black and white, sound\\nNoise (1972), 07:15, black and white, sound\\nNow (1973), 11:45 min, color, sound\\nOn Screen (1972), 7:45 min, black and white, sound\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nOn November 4, 2009, Benglis\\'s first European retrospective opened at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, in Dublin, where it ran through January 24, 2010.

       "  'Jim Dine (born June 16, 1935) is an American artist. Dine\\'s work includes painting, drawing, printmaking (in many forms including lithographs, etchings, gravure, intaglio, woodcuts, letterpress and linocuts), sculpture and photography; his early works encompassed assemblage and happenings, while in recent years his poetry output, both in publications and readings, has increased.\\nDine has been associated with many art movements including Neo-Dada (use of collage and found objects), Abstract Expressionism (the gestural nature of his painting), and Pop Art (affixing everyday objects including tools, rope, articles of clothing and even a bathroom sink) to his canvases, yet he has avoided such classifications. At the core of his art, regardless of the medium of the specific work, lies an intense autobiographical reflection, a relentless exploration and criticism of self through a number of personal motifs including: the heart, the bathrobe, tools, antique sculpture, and the character of Pinocchio (among flora, skulls, birds and figurative self-portraits). Dine\\'s approach is all-encompassing: \"Dine\\'s art has a stream of consciousness quality to its evolution, and is based on all aspects of his life—what he is reading, objects he comes upon in souvenir shops around the world, a serious study of art from every time and place that he understands as being useful to his own practice.\"\\nDine has had more than 300 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1978), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1984–85), Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, Michigan (2011) and Museum Folkwang, Essen (2015–16). His work is in permanent collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate Gallery, London; Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Tokyo; and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut.\\nDine\\'s distinctions include nomination to Academy of Arts and Letters in New York (1980), Commandeur de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003), the British Museum Medal (2015) following his donation of 234 prints to the museum in 2014, membership of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (2017), and Chevalier de l\\'Ordre de la Légion d\\'Honneur (2018).\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nDine\\'s first formal training took the form of night courses at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, in which he enrolled in 1952 at the age of 16, while attending Walnut Hills High School. It was a decision motivated both by his artistic calling and the lack of appropriate training at high school: \"I always knew I was always an artist and even though I tried to conform to high school life in those years, I found it difficult because I wanted to express myself artistically, and the school I went to had no facilities for that.\" In 1954, while still attending evening courses, Dine was inspired by a copy of Paul J. Sachs\\' Modern Prints and Drawings (1954), particularly by the German Expressionist woodcuts it reproduced, including work by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938), Emil Nolde (1867–1956) and Max Beckmann (1884–1950)—\"I was shocked by them\" — and began creating woodcuts in the basement of his maternal grandparents, with whom he was then living.\\nAfter high school Dine enrolled at the University of Cincinnati but was unsatisfied: \"They didn\\'t have an art school, they had a design school. I tried that for half a year. It was ridiculous […] All I wanted to do was paint.\" At the recommendation of a friend majoring in theatre at Ohio University in Athens, Dine enrolled there in 1955, where he recalls being \"blown away\", not by the facilities but because: \"I sensed a bucolic freedom in the foothills of the Appalachians where I could possibly develop and be an artist.\" Under printmaking teacher Donald Roberts (1923–2015) Dine experimented in lithography, etching, intaglio, dry paint and woodcuts. At Roberts\\' suggestion, Dine subsequently studied for six months with Ture Bengtz (1907–73) at the School of Fine Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, before returning to Ohio University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1957 (remaining for an additional year to make paintings and prints, with the permission of the faculty).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nIn 1958 Dine moved to New York, where he taught at the Rhodes School. In the same year he founded the Judson Gallery at the Judson Church in Greenwich Village with Claes Oldenburg and Marcus Ratliff, eventually meeting Allan Kaprow and Bob Whitman: together they became pioneers of happenings and performances, including Dine\\'s The Smiling Workman of 1959. Dine\\'s first exhibition was at the Reuben Gallery, where he also staged the elaborate performance Car Crash (1960), which he describes as \"a cacophony of sounds and words spoken by a great white Venus with animal grunts and howls by me.\" Another important early work was The House (1960), an environment incorporating found objects and street debris, installed at the Judson Gallery.\\nDine continued to include everyday items (including personal possessions) in his work, which linked him to Pop Art—an affinity strengthened by his inclusion in the influential 1962 exhibition \"New Painting of Common Objects\" at the Pasadena Art Museum, curated by Walter Hopps and later cited as the first institutional survey of American Pop Art, including works by Robert Dowd, Joe Goode, Phillip Hefferton, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Ruscha, Wayne Thiebaud and Andy Warhol. Dine has, however, consistently distanced himself from Pop Art: \"I\\'m not a Pop artist. I\\'m not part of the movement because I\\'m too subjective. Pop is concerned with exteriors. I\\'m concerned with interiors. When I use objects, I see them as a vocabulary of feelings. […] What I try to do in my work is explore myself in physical terms—to explain something in terms of my own sensibilities.\"\\n\\n\\n== Motifs ==\\n\\nSince the early 1960s Dine has refined a selection of motifs through which he has explored his self in myriad forms and media, and throughout the different locations/studios in which he has worked, including: London (1968–71); Putnam, Vermont (1971–85); Walla Walla, Washington (since 1983); Paris (since 2001); and Göttingen (since 2007), in a studio adjacent to the premises of Steidl, the printer and publisher of the majority of his books.\\n\\n\\n=== Bathrobes ===\\nDine first depicted bathrobes in 1964 while searching for a new form of self-portraiture at a time when \"it wasn\\'t cool to just make a self-portrait\"; he thus conceived an approach without representing his face. Dine subsequently saw an image of a bathrobe in an advertisement in the New York Times Magazine, and adopted it as a surrogate self-portrait, which he has since depicted in varying degrees of realism and expressionism.\\n\\n\\n=== Hearts ===\\nDine initially expressed this motif in the form of a large heart of stuffed red satin hung above the character of Puck in a 1965–66 production of William Shakespeare\\'s A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream at the Actors\\' Workshop in San Francisco, for which he designed the sets (his original introduction to the motif had been a series of red hearts on white backgrounds he had seen as a student). In time, the heart became for Dine \"a universal symbol that I could put paint onto\" and \"as good a structure geographically as any I could find in nature. It is a kind of landscape and within that landscape I could grow anything, and I think I did.\" The formal simplicity of the heart has made it a subject he could wholly claim as his own, an empty vessel for ongoing experimentation into which to project his changing self. The heart\\'s status as a universal symbol of love further mirrors Dine\\'s commitment to the creative act: \"…what I was in love with was the fact that I was put here to make these hearts—this art. There is a similar sense of love in this method, this act of making art…\"\\n\\n\\n=== Pinocchio ===\\n\"Trying to birth this puppet into life is a great story. It is the story of how you make art\"—Jim Dine. Dine\\'s fascination with the character of Pinocchio, the boy protagonist in Carlo Collodi\\'s The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883), dates to his childhood, when, at the age of six he viewed with his mother Walt Disney\\'s animated film Pinocchio (1940): \"It has haunted my heart forever!\" This formative experience deepened in 1964 when Dine discovered a detailed figure of Pinocchio while purchasing tools: \"It was hand painted, had a paper maché head, beautiful little clothes and articulated limbs. I took it home and I kept it on my shelf for 25 years. I did not do anything with it. I did not know what to do with it, but it was always with me. When I moved houses, I would take it and put it on the bookshelf or put it in a drawer and bring it out, essentially to play with it.\" Yet it was only in the 1990s that Dine represented Pinocchio in his art, first in a diptych; the next Pinocchios were shown at the 1997 Venice Biennale and an exhibition at Richard Gray Gallery, Chicago. Notable depictions since include the 41 color lithographs printed at Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris, in 2006; the book Pinocchio (Steidl, 2006), combining Collodi\\'s text and Dine\\'s illustrations; two monumental bronze sculptures of 9 meters\\' height: Walking to Borås (2008) in Borås, Sweden, and Busan Pinocchio (2013) in Busan, South Korea; and Pinocchio (Emotional) (2012), a twelve-foot bronze at the Cincinnati Art Museum. In recent years Dine\\'s self-identification with the character of Pinocchio has shifted to Gepetto, the gifted woodcarver who crafts the boy puppet.\\n\\n\\n=== Antique sculpture ===\\n\"I have this reverence for the ancient world. I mean Greco-Roman society. This always interested me and the product of it is interesting to me and the literature is interesting—the historic literature. I have this need to connect with the past in my way…\"—Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio, Dine\\'s fascination with antique sculpture dates to early in his life: \"I had always been interested as a child in \\'the antique,\\' because my mother took me to the art museum in Cincinnati, and they had a few beautiful pieces.\"\\nThe antique has thus been present since his early work, for example in Untitled (After Winged Victory) (1959), now held in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, a sculpture inspired by the Winged Victory of Samothrace (ca. 200 B.C.) and composed of a painted robe hung on a found lamp frame and held together with wire, which Dine describes as \"almost like outsider art\" and he first showed at the Ruben Gallery. He most frequently expresses the antique through the figure of the Venus de Milo (ca. 100 B.C.), a small plaster cast of which he bought in Paris; he initially included the cast in 1970s still-life paintings, \"But then I knocked the head off it and made it mine.\" Dine is also inspired by specific sculpture collections, for example that of the Glyptothek in Munich, which he visited in 1984, resulting in the 40 \"Glyptotek Drawings\" [sic] of 1987–88, made in preparation for a series of lithographs. Of the experience Dine recalls: \"The museum director let me come in at night and, therefore, it was a meditation on the pieces I was drawing because I was alone. I felt a link between the ages of history and me and a communication between these anonymous guys who had carved these things centuries before me. It was a way to join hands across the generations, and for me to feel that I did not just grow like a tumbleweed but that I came from somewhere. I belonged to a tradition and it gave me the history I needed.\"\\nAn important recent work that incorporates the antique is Dine\\'s Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets), an installation consisting of 8-foot wooden sculptures inspired by ancient Greek statues of dancing women arranged around a 7-foot self-portrait head of the artist, all installed in a room whose walls he has inscribed with a sprawling poem, \"with its Orphic themes of travel, loss, and the possibilities of art.\" Originally shown in 2008–09 at the Getty Villa, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and echoing the 350–300 B.C. Sculptural Group of a Seated Poet and Sirens (2) with unjoined fragmentary curls (304) held in the Getty collection, Dine has since updated Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets) as a permanent, site-specific installation housed in the purpose-built Jim Dine Pavilion, adjacent to the Kunsthaus Göttingen.\\n\\n\\n=== Tools ===\\n\"I never stopped being enchanted by these objects.\" — Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio and antique sculpture, tools are a motif inextricably linked to Dine\\'s childhood. His introduction to them came through his maternal grandfather, Morris Cohen, who ran The Save Supply Company hardware store in Cincinnati; Dine lived with Cohen for three years as a boy, and had daily contact with him until the age of 19. Dine recalls hammers, saws, drills, screwdrivers among various hardware paraphernalia; later, Dine worked in Cohen\\'s store on Saturdays.\\nDine was thus inaugurated both into the practical functions of tools and their aesthetic possibilities: \"I admired the beautiful enamel on the ceramic toilets and sinks. I admired the way different colors of conduit electric wire was in rolls next to each other, and the way it had been braided. In the paint department, the color charts looked to me like perfect, perfect jewel boxes.\" He recalls the sensual impact of \"very, very beautiful\" pristine white paint: \"I would play with it by sticking one of his screwdrivers in and breaking the skin and moving it around. It was like white taffy. It had a fabulous smell of linseed oil and turpentine.\" Accordingly, he finds them \"as mysterious and interesting an object as any other object. There\\'s no aristocracy here.\"\\nAs a motif that symbolizes raw materials being transformed into art — tools have unique status in Dine\\'s practice as \"artificial extensions of his hands, effectively allowing him to shape and form certain given conditions and objects more systematically,\" and as \"\\'primary objects\\' that create a connection with our human past and the hand.\" In Dine\\'s own words, the tool is fundamentally \"a metaphor for \\'work\\'\".\\nDine has integrated real tools into his art from his earliest works — for example, Big Black Work Wall (1961), a painting with tools attached, and The Wind and Tools (A Glossary of Terms) (2009), three wooden Venus statues wearing girdles belts of tools—as well as depicting them in media including paintings, drawings, photographs and prints. An extraordinary printing series involving tools is A History of Communism (2014), in which Dine printed tool motifs on top of lithographs made from stones found in an art academy in Berlin and showing four decades of students\\' work from the German Democratic Republic. By overlaying his own personal vocabulary of tools, Dine engages with the symbolic tools of communism — the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union, and the hammer and compass, ringed by rye, of the German Democratic Republic — and unsettles the assertion of any certain \"truth\", showing that \"history is never a coherent narrative—although it might be presented as such with an ulterior motive—but rather a fragmented, layered and multi-sited process.\"\\n\\n\\n== Selected teaching positions ==\\n1965 – guest lecturer at Yale University and artist-in-residence, Oberlin College, Ohio\\n1966 – teaching residency at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York\\n1993–95 – Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, Salzburg\\n1995–96 – Hochschule der Künste, Berlin\\n\\n\\n== Selected long-term collaborations ==\\n1962–76: gallerist Ileana Sonnabend, New York\\n1975–2008: printmaker Aldo Crommelynck, Paris\\n1978–2016: Pace Gallery, New York\\n1979–present: gallerist Alan Cristea, London\\n1983–2018: gallerist Richard Gray, Chicago\\n1983–present: Walla Walla Foundry, Walla Walla, Washington\\n1987–2003: printmaker Kurt Zein, Vienna\\n1991–2016: Spring Street Workshop, New York, with printers including Julia D\\'Amario, Ruth Lingen, Katherine Kuehn, Bill Hall\\n1998–present: printer and publisher Gerhard Steidl, Göttingen\\n2000–present: gallerist Daniel Templon, Paris-Brussels\\n2003–18: printmakers Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris\\n2010–present: foundry Blue Mountain Fine Art, Baker City, Oregon\\n2016–present: printmakers Steindruck Chavanne Pechmann, Apetlon\\n2016–21: Gray Gallery, Chicago\\n\\n\\n== Selected permanent collections ==\\n\\nAllen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin\\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago\\nBowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, ME\\nBrooklyn Museum, Brooklyn\\nCincinnati Art Museum, Cincinnati\\nCleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland\\nFogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge\\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.\\nIndianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis\\nIsrael Museum, Jerusalem\\nLouisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humelbeak, Denmark\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis\\nMuseum Folkwang, Essen\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Chicago\\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nPalm Springs Art Museum, CA\\nSnite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame\\nSolomon R.

       "  'Sir Anish Mikhail Kapoor,  (born 12 March 1954) is a British-Indian sculptor specializing in installation art and conceptual art. Born in Mumbai, Kapoor attended the elite all-boys Indian boarding school The Doon School, before moving to the UK to begin his art training at Hornsey College of Art and, later, Chelsea School of Art and Design.\\nHis notable public sculptures include Cloud Gate (2006, also known as \"The Bean\") in Chicago\\'s Millennium Park; Sky Mirror, exhibited at the Rockefeller Center in New York City in 2006 and Kensington Gardens in London in 2010; Temenos, at Middlehaven, Middlesbrough; Leviathan, at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2011; and ArcelorMittal Orbit, commissioned as a permanent artwork for London\\'s Olympic Park and completed in 2012. In 2017, Kapoor designed the statuette for the 2018 Brit Awards.\\nAn image of Kapoor features in the British cultural icons section of the newly designed British passport in 2015. In 2016, he was announced as a recipient of the LennonOno Grant for Peace.\\nKapoor has received several distinctions and prizes, such as the Premio Duemila Prize at the XLIV Venice Biennale in 1990, the Turner Prize in 1991, the Unilever Commission for the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government in 2012, a knighthood in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to visual arts, an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Oxford in 2014. and the 2017 Genesis Prize for \"being one of the most influential and innovative artists of his generation and for his many years of advocacy for refugees and displaced people\".\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAnish Mikhail Kapoor was born in Mumbai, India, to an Iraqi Jewish mother and an Indian Punjabi Hindu father. His maternal grandfather served as cantor of the synagogue in Pune. At the time, Baghdadi Jews constituted the majority of the Jewish community in Mumbai. His father was a hydrographer and applied physicist who served in the Indian Navy. Kapoor is the brother of Ilan Kapoor, a professor at York University, Toronto, Canada.\\nKapoor attended The Doon School, an all-boys boarding school in Dehradun, India. In 1971 he moved to Israel with one of his two brothers, initially living on a kibbutz. He began to study electrical engineering, but had trouble with mathematics and quit after six months. In Israel, he decided to become an artist. In 1973, he left for Britain to attend Hornsey College of Art and Chelsea School of Art and Design. There he found a role model in Paul Neagu, an artist who provided a meaning to what he was doing. Kapoor went on to teach at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1979 and in 1982 was Artist in Residence at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. He has lived and worked in London since the early 1970s.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nKapoor became known in the 1980s for his geometric or biomorphic sculptures using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment and plaster. These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. He has said of the sculptures \"While making the pigment pieces, it occurred to me that they all form themselves out of each other. So I decided to give them a generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there...\" Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.\\n\\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Kapoor was acclaimed for his explorations of matter and non-matter, specifically evoking the void in both free-standing sculptural works and ambitious installations. Many of his sculptures seem to recede into the distance, disappear into the ground or distort the space around them. In 1987, he began working in stone. His later stone works are made of solid, quarried stone, many of which have carved apertures and cavities, often alluding to, and playing with dualities (earth-sky, matter-spirit, lightness-darkness, visible-invisible, conscious-unconscious, male-female, and body-mind). \"In the end, I’m talking about myself. And thinking about making nothing, which I see as a void. But then that’s something, even though it really is nothing.\"\\nSince 1995, he has worked with the highly reflective surface of polished stainless steel. These works are mirror-like, reflecting or distorting the viewer and surroundings. Over the course of the following decade Kapoor\\'s sculptures ventured into more ambitious manipulations of form and space. He produced a number of large works, including Taratantara (1999), a 35-metre-high piece which was installed in the Baltic Flour Mills in Gateshead, England, prior to the renovation beginning there which turned the structure into the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art; and Marsyas (2002), a large work consisting of three steel rings joined by a single span of PVC membrane that reached end to end of the 3,400-square-foot (320 m2) Turbine Hall of Tate Modern. Kapoor\\'s Eye in Stone (Norwegian: Øye i stein) is permanently placed at the shore of the fjord in Lødingen in northern Norway as part of Artscape Nordland. In 2000, one of Kapoor\\'s works, Parabolic Waters, consisting of rapidly rotating coloured water, was shown outside the Millennium Dome in London.\\nThe use of red wax is also part of his repertoire, evocative of flesh, blood, and transfiguration. In 2007, he showed Svayambh (which translated from Sanskrit means \"self-generated\"), a 1.5-metre block of red wax that moved on rails through the Nantes Musée des Beaux-Arts as part of the Biennale estuaire; this piece was shown again in a major show at the Haus der Kunst in Munich and in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London. Some of Kapoor\\'s work blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. In 2008, Kapoor created Memory in Berlin and New York for the Guggenheim Foundation, his first piece in Cor-Ten, which is formulated to produce a protective coating of rust. Weighing 24 tons and made up of 156 parts, it calls to mind Richard Serra\\'s huge, rusty steel works, which also invite viewers into perceptually confounding interiors.\\nIn 2009, Kapoor became the first Guest Artistic Director of Brighton Festival. Kapoor installed four sculptures during the festival: Sky Mirror at Brighton Pavilion gardens; C-Curve at The Chattri, Blood Relations (a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie); and 1000 Names, both at the Fabrica Gallery. He also created a large site-specific work titled The Dismemberment of Jeanne d’Arc and a performance-based installation: Imagined Monochrome. The public response was so overwhelming that police had to re-divert traffic around C Curve at the Chattri and exercise crowd control.\\nIn September 2009, Kapoor was the first living artist to have a solo exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts. As well as surveying his career to date, the show also included new works. On display were Non-Object mirror works, cement sculptures previously unseen, and Shooting into the Corner, a cannon that fires pellets of wax into the corner of the gallery. Previously shown at MAK, Vienna, in January 2009, it is a work with dramatic presence and associations and also continues Kapoor\\'s interest in the self-made object, as the wax builds up on the walls and floor of the gallery the work slowly oozes out its form.\\nIn early 2011, Kapoor\\'s work, Leviathan, was the annual Monumenta installation for the Grand Palais in Paris. Kapoor described the work as: \"A single object, a single form, a single colour...My ambition is to create a space with in a space that responds to the height and luminosity of the Nave at the Grand Palais. Visitors will be invited to walk inside the work, to immerse themselves in colour, and it will, I hope, be a contemplative and poetic experience.\"\\nIn 2011, Kapoor exhibited Dirty Corner at the Fabbrica del Vapore in Milan. Having fully occupied the site\\'s \"cathedral\" space, the work consists of a huge steel volume, 60 metres long and 8 metres high, that visitors enter. Inside, they gradually lose their perception of space, as it gets progressively darker and darker until there is no light, forcing people to use their other senses to guide them through the space. The entrance of the tunnel is goblet-shaped, featuring an interior and exterior surface that is circular, making minimal contact with the ground. Over the course of the exhibition, the work was progressively covered by some 160 cubic metres of earth by a large mechanical device, forming a sharp mountain of dirt which the tunnel appears to be running through.\\nIn 2016, his art exposition in MUAC (Mexico City) was a success, with literary contributions from Catherine Lampert, Cecilia Delgado, and Mexican writer Pablo Soler Frost.\\nKapoor sued the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) in 2018. The gun lobby group had, without the sculptor\\'s consent, used a filmed image of Cloud Gate in an approximately one-minute-long promotional video called \"The Violence of Lies\". The suit was ultimately settled out of court. Kapoor reported that the settlement included the removal of his work from the NRA\\'s film, saying \"They have now complied with our demand to remove the unauthorized image of my sculpture Cloud Gate from their abhorrent video, which seeks to promote fear, hostility, and division in American society\".\\n\\n\\n=== Public commissions ===\\n\\nKapoor\\'s earliest public commissions include the Cast Iron Mountain at the Tachikawa Art Project in Japan, as well as an untitled 1995 piece installed at Toronto\\'s Simcoe Place resembling mountain peaks. In 2001, Sky Mirror, a large mirror piece that reflects the sky and surroundings, was commissioned for a site outside the Nottingham Playhouse. Since 2006, The Bean, a 110-ton stainless steel sculpture with a mirror finish, officially titled Cloud Gate, has been permanently installed in Millennium Park in Chicago. Viewers are able to walk beneath the sculpture and look up into an bellybutton or \"omphalos\" above them.\\nIn the autumn of 2006, a second 10-metre Sky Mirror, was installed at Rockefeller Center, New York City. This work was later exhibited in Kensington Gardens in 2010 as part of the show Turning the World Upside Down, along with three other major mirror works.\\n\\nIn 2009, Kapoor created the permanent, site-specific work Earth Cinema for Pollino National Park, the largest national park in Italy, as part of the project ArtePollino – Another South. Kapoor\\'s work, Cinema di Terra (Earth Cinema), is a 45m long, 3m wide and 7m deep cut into the landscape made from concrete and earth. People can enter from both sides and walk along it, viewing the earth void within. Cinema di Terra officially opened to public in September 2009.\\nKapoor was also commissioned by Tees Valley Regeneration (TVR) to produce five pieces of public art, collectively known as the Tees Valley Giants. The first of these sculptures, Tememos, was unveiled to the public in June 2010. Temenos stands 50 metres high and is 110 metres in length. A steel wire mesh pulled taut between two enormous steel hoops, it remains an ethereal and an uncertain form despite its colossal scale.\\nIn 2010, Turning the World Upside Down, Jerusalem was commissioned and installed at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  The sculpture is described as a \"16-foot tall polished-steel hourglass\" and it \"reflects and reverses the Jerusalem sky and the museum\\'s landscape, a likely reference to the city\\'s duality of celestial and earthly, holy and profane\".\\nThe Greater London Authority selected Kapoor\\'s Orbit sculpture from a shortlist of five artists as the permanent artwork for the Olympic Park of the 2012 Olympic Games. At 115 metres tall, Orbit is the tallest sculpture in the UK.\\nWhen asked if engagement with people and places is the key to successful public art, Kapoor said:\\n\\nI’m thinking about the mythical wonders of the world, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Tower of Babel. It\\'s as if the collective will comes up with something that has resonance on an individual level and so becomes mythic. I can claim to take that as a model for a way of thinking. Art can do it, and I’m going to have a damn good go. I want to occupy the territory, but the territory is an idea and a way of thinking as much as a context that generates objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Architectural projects ===\\nThroughout his career, Kapoor has worked extensively with architects and engineers. He says this body of work is neither pure sculpture nor pure architecture.\\nHis notable architectural projects include:\\n\\nArk Nova, an inflatable concert hall that will travel around the earthquake struck regions of Japan, designed in collaboration with architect Arata Isozaki.\\nOrbit, the permanent artwork for London\\'s Olympic Park, in collaboration with engineer Cecil Balmond.\\nTemenos the first work of the Tees Valley Giants, the world\\'s five largest sculptures, in collaboration with Cecil Balmond. Temenos is situated in Middlehaven Dock, Middlesbrough.\\nDismemberment Site 1, installed in New Zealand at the Gibbs Farm sculpture park, owned by New Zealand businessman and art patron Alan Gibbs.\\n56 Leonard Street, New York, in collaboration with architects Herzog and de Meuron.\\nTwo subway stations in Naples at Monte San Angelo and Triano in collaboration with Future Systems.\\nTaratantara (1999–2000) was installed at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead and later at Piazza Plebiscito, Naples.\\nAn unrealised project for the Millennium Dome, London, (1995) in collaboration with Philip Gumuchdjian.\\nBuilding for a Void, created for Expo \\'92, Seville, in collaboration with David Connor.\\nOf his vision for the Cumana station in Monte Sant\\'Angelo, Naples, Italy under construction (as of June 2008), Kapoor has said:\\n\\nIt\\'s very vulva-like. The tradition of the Paris or Moscow metro is of palaces of light, underground. I wanted to do exactly the opposite – to acknowledge that we are going underground. So it\\'s dark, and what I’ve done is bring the tunnel up and roll it over as a form like a sock.\\n\\n\\n=== Working with text ===\\nIn a collaboration with author Salman Rushdie, Kapoor conceived a sculpture consisting of two bronze boxes conjoined with red wax and inscribed around the outside with the first two paragraphs of Rushdie\\'s text; \"Blood Relations\" or an \"Interrogation of the Arabian Nights\" in 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Stage design ===\\nKapoor has designed stage sets including for; the opera Idomeneo at Glyndebourne in 2003; Pelléas et Mélisande, La Monnaie in Brussels, and a dance-theatre piece called in-i with Akram Khan and Juliette Binoche at the National Theatre in London.\\n\\n\\n=== Anish Kapoor Foundation ===\\nThe Anish Kapoor Foundation was founded as a charity in 2017, registered in London. In early 2021, the Venice city council approved construction plans for the foundation to convert the Palazzo Priuli Manfrin into an exhibition venue, artist studio and repository for a number of the artist\\'s works from the foundation\\'s collection. The project will be led by architecture firms FWR Associati of Venice and Studio Una of Hamburg.\\n\\n\\n== Vantablack controversy ==\\nIn 2014, Kapoor began working with Vantablack, a substance thought to be one of the least reflective substances known. Vantablack S-VIS, a sprayable paint which uses randomly aligned carbon nanotubes and only has high absorption in the visible light band, also called the \"blackest black\" colour, has been exclusively licensed to Anish Kapoor\\'s studio for artistic use. His exclusive license to the material has been criticized in the art world, but he has defended the agreement, saying: \"Why exclusive? Because it\\'s a collaboration, because I am wanting to push them to a certain use for it. I\\'ve collaborated with people who make things out of stainless steel for years and that\\'s exclusive.\"\\nArtists like Christian Furr and Stuart Semple have criticised Kapoor for what they view to be the appropriation of a unique material to the exclusion of others. In retaliation, Semple developed a pigment called the \"pinkest pink\" and specifically made it available to everyone except Anish Kapoor and anyone affiliated with him. He later stated that the move was itself intended as something like performance art and that he did not anticipate the amount of attention it received. In December 2016, Kapoor obtained the pigment and posted an image on Instagram of his extended middle finger which had been dipped in Semple\\'s pink. Semple also developed more products such as \"Black 2.0\" and \"Black 3.0\", which are supposed to look nearly identical to Vantablack despite being acrylic, and \"Diamond Dust\", an extremely reflective glitter made of crushed glass shards that are designed to hurt Kapoor if he dipped his finger in it, all of which were released with the same restriction against Kapoor as the \"pinkest pink\".\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nKapoor initially began exhibiting as part of New British Sculpture art scene, along with fellow British sculptors Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon. His first solo exhibition took place at Patrice Alexandra, Paris, in 1980. He achieved widespread recognition when he represented Britain at the 1990 Venice Biennale, and recounts the experience in Sarah Thornton\\'s Seven Days in the Art World. In 1992 Kapoor contributed to documenta IX with Building Descent into Limbo. In 2004, he participated in The 5th Gwangju Biennale in Gwangju, Korea. Solo exhibitions of his work have since been held in the Tate and Hayward Gallery in London, Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland, Reina Sofia in Madrid, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Musée des arts contemporains (Grand-Hornu) in Belgium, the CAPC Museum of Contemporary Art in Bordeaux, the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in Brazil, and the Guggenheim in Bilbao, New York City and Berlin.\\nIn 2008, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston held the first U.S. mid career survey of Kapoor\\'s work. That same year, Kapoor\\'s Islamic Mirror (2008), a circular concave mirror, was installed in a 13th-century Arab palace now being used as by the Convent of Santa Clara in Murcia, Spain.\\nKapoor was the first living British artist to take over the Royal Academy, London, in 2009; the show attracted 275,000 visitors, rendering it at the time the most successful exhibition ever by a living artist held in London. Eventually it was overtaken by the more than 478,000 who attended the David Hockney exhibition at the Tate Modern in 2017. This show subsequently travelled to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2010, Kapoor retrospective exhibitions were held at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) in New Delhi and Mumbai\\'s Mehboob Studio, the first showcase of his work in the country of his birth. In 2011 Kapoor had a solo touring exhibition with the Arts Council, part of their \"Flashback \" series of shows. In May he exhibited Leviathan at the Grand Palais, and two concurrent shows in Milan at the Rotonda della Besana and Fabbrica del Vapore.  He had a major exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (MCA) from December 2012 to April 2013 as part of the Sydney International Art Series.\\nDirty Corner, exhibited at the Palace of Versailles in 2015, was a topic of controversy due to its \"blatantly sexual\" nature. Kapoor himself reportedly described the work as \"the vagina of a queen who is taking power\".\\nIn 2020 Kapoor unveiled a new exhibition at the grounds of Houghton Hall in Norfolk. It was the largest ever outdoor exhibition of pieces by Kapoor, containing 21 sculptures, some previously unseen, as well as a selection of drawings of his.\\nFrom 2 October 2021 – 13 February 2022 an exhibition of works created during the pandemic – ‘Painting’ – was shown at the Museum of Modern Art Oxford.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nKapoor\\'s work is collected worldwide, notably by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; Tate Modern in London; Fondazione Prada in Milan; the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; the Guggenheim in Bilbao; De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in Tilburg, the Netherlands; the Moderna Museet, Stockholm; the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan; and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1995, Kapoor married German-born medieval art historian Susanne Spicale. They have a daughter Alba and a son Ishan and lived in a house designed by architect Tony Fretton in Chelsea, London. In 2009, Kapoor purchased a 14,500 sq ft (1,350 m2) Georgian-style residence at Lincoln\\'s Inn Fields for about £3.6 million and had it redesigned by David Chipperfield. The couple separated and divorced in 2013. He later married garden designer Sophie Walker, his former sculptor\\'s assistant, after the two began dating in 2013. The couple has one daughter together.\\n\\n\\n== Literature ==\\nHeinz-Norbert Jocksin conversation with Anish Kapoor.

       "  \"Markus Oehlen (born 1956) is a German painter, sculpture and musician. In the 1970s and 80s he was a founding member of the influential neo-expressionist art movement Neue Wilde in Düsseldorf, alongside Martin Kippenberger, Markus Lüpertz, and his brother Albert Oehlen.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nMarkus Oehlen was born in Krefeld. His father, Adolf Oehlen, was a graphic designer and cartoonist. Oehlen completed an apprenticeship as a technical draftsman, from 1971 to 1973. He studied at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, from 1976 to 1982, where he was a student with Alfonso Hüppi. In 1977 he met Martin Kippenberger.\\nIn 1981 he formed the “Church of Indifference” together with Werner Büttner and his brother Albert. In the same year he exhibited at Rundschau Deutschland. In 1984 he was represented at the exhibition From Here - Two Months of New German Art, in Düsseldorf. In 1987 he received the Berlin Art Prize. In 1993 he held the exhibition “Projects 39”, together with Georg Herold, at the Museum of Modern Art, in New York. Since 2002, Oehlen has held a professorship at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, in Munich.\\n\\nSince 2017, Oehlen has been working in a studio built by Westner Schührer Zöhrer in the north of Munich. The house was awarded the Bauwelt Prize in 2019 and an award at the BDA Prize Bavaria.\\n\\n\\n== Artwork ==\\nOehlen is one of the main representatives of the Neue Wilden. His works are a commentary on the standardized values of the bourgeoisie.  Oehlen's work presents a revolt, in a sort punk style, often in dark-toned imagery against the apathy caused by prosperity in the 1980s and to minimalist art. Following the tradition of Dada and Fluxus, he worked to dismantle traditional concepts of art. What is characteristic of his paintings is the overlaying of various motifs in a dense, impasto style and the borrowings from pop culture. His diverse working techniques and layered image structure suggests a comparison with the effect of sampling in contemporary music. In addition to painting, he also creates sculptures from Styrofoam bodies.\\n\\n\\n== Musical activity ==\\nOehlen was a member of the punk band Charley's Girls, and also of Mittagspause and Fehlfarben. He worked mainly as a drummer in the music project Flying Klassenfield, among others. He also worked as a DJ at Ratinger Hof.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",
       "  'Pierre Jean Louis Germain Soulages (French: [sulaʒ]; 24 December 1919 – 25 October 2022) was a French painter, printmaker, and sculptor. In 2014, President François Hollande of France described him as \"the world\\'s greatest living artist.\" His works are held by leading museums of the world, and there is a museum dedicated to his art in his hometown of Rodez.\\nSoulages is known as \"the painter of black\", owing to his interest in the colour \"both as a colour and a non-colour. When light is reflected on black, it transforms and transmutes it. It opens a mental field all its own.\" He saw light as a work material; striations of the black surface of his paintings enable him to reflect light, allowing the black to come out of darkness and into brightness, thus becoming a luminous colour.\\nSoulages produced 104 stained-glass windows for the Romanesque architecture of the Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy in Conques from 1987 to 1994. He received international awards, and the Louvre in Paris held a retrospective of his works on the occasion of his centenary.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and family ==\\nSoulages was born in Rodez, Aveyron, on 24 December 1919. His father, Amans, was a carriage maker who ran a hunting and fishing shop. He died when Pierre was age five. Pierre was raised by his older sister Antoinette and their mother, Aglaé Zoé Julie (Corp) Soulages. As a child, he was interested in the area\\'s menhirs, in Celtic carvings in the local museum, and also in the Romanesque architecture of the Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy in Conques. He dressed in all black, and his mother disliked it.\\n\\n\\n== Early career ==\\nInspired by the art of Paul Cézanne and Pablo Picasso, Soulages began studies at the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in Paris, but soon dropped out because he was disappointed by the traditional style.\\nAfter wartime military service, he studied further at the Fine Arts School of Montpellier. He opened a studio in Courbevoie, Paris, painting in \"complete abstraction\", with black as the dominant colour, and experimenting with walnut oil. His first exhibition was at the Salon des Indépendants in 1947. He also worked as a designer of stage sets. He exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1954, and in New York City the same year, gaining recognition in the United States. Betty Parsons Gallery showed his work in New York in 1949. In 1950, Leo Castelli organized an exhibition at Sidney Janis.  In 1954 Soulages began showing at Samuel Kootz.  His works were included in the two major exhibitions of European artists, Younger European Painters at the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum (1953) and The New Decade: 22 European Painters and Sculptors at the Museum of Modern Art (1955) in New York. In 1979, Soulages was made a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\\n\\n\\n== Later career ==\\nFrom 1987 to 1994, he produced 104 stained-glass windows for the Abbey of Sainte-Foy in Conques, prepared by around 700 tests at a small factory near Münster, Germany. A gallerist reflected the windows in the context of his paintings:\\n\\nHe studied the way that light wouldn\\'t cross through the stained glass, but would be fractionally fragmented, exploded through the stained glass. So when you are in Conques and you see the light coming through these stained-glass panels, how the light hits the glass and then comes in and the harmonious explosion inside the church, it\\'s beyond religious. And that\\'s what he was trying to achieve with his black paintings, to capture whatever you give them, but they\\'re reflected in a completely independent way. It puts you in front of the void, in front of fullness and emptiness, in front of strength and vulnerability. It has this tension, and that is what it was to know Soulages.\\nSoulages was the first living artist to have been invited to exhibit at the state Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg and later with the Tretyakov Gallery of Moscow (2001).\\nIn 2007, the Musée Fabre of Montpellier devoted an entire room to Soulages, presenting a donation he made to the city. It included twenty paintings dating from 1951 to 2006, among which were major works from the 1960s, two large \"plus-black\" works from the 1970s, and several large polyptychs. A retrospective was held at the Centre National d\\'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou from October 2009 to March 2010. In 2010, the Museum of Mexico City presented a retrospective of paintings that also included an interview-video with the artist.\\nIn 2014, the Musée Soulages opened in Soulages\\' hometown of Rodez, as a place to permanently display his works and to house temporary contemporary exhibitions. Soulages and his wife donated 900 works.  The paintings represent all stages of his work, from post-war oils to a phase of work he calls Outrenoir.  It was the most complete display of work from his first 30 years. Some space in the museum is always reserved for exhibitions of other contemporary artists, as Soulages had wanted from the beginning.\\nIn 2014, Soulages presented fourteen recent works in his first American exhibition in 10 years, at Dominique Lévy and Galerie Perrotin, New York. In September 2019, the Lévy Gorvy Gallery in New York held a major exhibition ahead of the retrospective at the Louvre Museum in December celebrating his 100th birthday.\\nOn 17 November 2021, his Peinture 195 x 130 cm, 4 août 1961, was auctioned for $20.2M, an auction record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic practice ==\\n\\nSoulages said, \"My instrument is not black but the light reflected from the black.\"  Naming his own practice Outrenoir (Beyond Black), the paintings he produces are known for their endless black depth, created by playing with the light reflected off of the texture of the paint.  Knowing that he needed a new term to define the way that he worked, Soulages invented \\'Outrenoir\\' to define his practice.  Not having a translation into English, the closest meaning is \\'beyond black\\'; in a 2014 interview he explained the definition of the term, \"Outrenoir doesn\\'t exist in English; the closest is \"beyond black.\" In French, you say \"outre-Manche,\" \"beyond the Channel,\" to mean England or \"outre-Rhin,\" \"beyond the Rhine,\" to mean Germany. In other words, \"beyond black\" is a different country from black.\"\\nThe infatuation Soulages had with black began long before his investigations with \\'Outrenoir\\' at the age of 60.  Initially inspired by his interest in the prehistoric  and his want of retreating to something more pure, primal and deliberately stripped of any other connotations, he says of his fascination with the colour, \"during thousands of years, men went underground, in the absolute black of grottoes, to paint with black.\" \"I made these because I found that the light reflected by the black surface elicits certain emotions in me. These aren\\'t monochromes. The fact that light can come from the colour which is supposedly the absence of light is already quite moving, and it is interesting to see how this happens.\"\\nApplying the paint in thick layers, Soulages\\' painting technique includes using objects such as spoons, tiny rakes and bits of rubber to work away at the painting, often making scraping, digging or etching movements depending on whether he wants to evoke a smooth or rough surface. The texture that is then produced either absorbs or rejects light, breaking up the surface of the painting by disrupting the uniformity of the black.  He often used bold cuts in vertical and horizontal lines, the crevasses and forms created by using angles and contours. In his recent work from 2013 to 2014, Soulages began to explicitly vary the pigment used in the paint, mixing matte and glossy types of black as well as hardened densities of black pigment. Preferring to suspend the paintings like walls, he uses wires to hang them in the middle of the room, \"I always liked paintings to be walls rather than windows. When we see a painting on a wall, it\\'s a window, so I often put my paintings in the middle of the space to make a wall. A window looks outside, but a painting should do the opposite—it should look inside of us\".\\nInstead of having titles, Soulages paintings are uniformly named as \"Peinture\" (transl.: Painting), followed by size and date of production. 17 December 1966 from 1966, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art demonstrates the artist\\'s boldly brushed black on white canvases. His works had to be hung without frames in exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nWhile at the Fine Arts School of Montpellier, Soulages met Colette Llaurens (born 1920). They were married on 24 October 1942. The couple had no children. In 2017, they permanently moved to their summer retreat in Sète.\\nSoulages died in Nîmes on 25 October 2022, less than two months before his 103rd birthday, and was survived by his wife had marked their 80th wedding anniversary, the day before his death.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nCollections of works by Soulages are held by many museums, including:\\n\\nCentre Georges Pompidou (Paris)\\nHonolulu Museum of Art\\nMontreal Museum of Fine Arts\\nMusée d\\'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris\\nMusée Soulages (Rodez)\\nMuseum of Modern Art (New York)\\nMuseum of Modern Art  (Rio de Janeiro)\\nNational Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.)\\nSolomon R.

       "  'Wolfgang Tillmans (born 16 August 1968) is a German photographer. His diverse body of work is distinguished by observation of his surroundings and an ongoing investigation of the photographic medium’s foundations.\\nTillmans was the first photographer, and first non-British person, to be awarded the Turner Prize. He has been the subject of large-scale retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern and Moderna Museet. In 2023, Tillmans was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time. He lives in Berlin and London.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nTillmans was born in 1968 in Remscheid in the German area of Bergisches Land. At the age of 14 to 16, visits to museums in Düsseldorf and to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne acquainted him with the photo-based art of Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, which counts among his earliest influences. During his first visit to England as an exchange student in 1983, he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. Also in high school, he became friends with Alexandra Bircken and Lutz Hülle.\\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Tillmans lived in Hamburg; there, in 1988, he had his first solo exhibitions, at Café Gnosa, Fabrik-Foto-Forum, and Front. From 1990 through 1992, he studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design (now Arts University Bournemouth) in southern England. \\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nAfter his studies he moved to London and then to New York in 1994 for a year, where he met the German painter Jochen Klein. After moving back to England, Tillmans lived with Klein until Klein died of AIDS-related complications in 1997.\\nFrom 1995, Tillmans primarily lived and worked in London. During the summer of 1998, Tillmans participated in a month-long residency at the last active Shaker community in the world, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine. \\nSince 2007, Tillmans has divided his time between Berlin and London. In Berlin, his studio is located in an annex of a modernist building from the early 1930s, designed by the architect Max Taut.\\n\\n\\n=== Beginnings ===\\n\\nTillmans was initially known for his seemingly casual, sometimes snapshot-like portraits of friends (most notably, fashion designer Lutz Huelle and fellow artist Alexandra Bircken) and other youth in his immediate surroundings and scene. His photos – from the Europride in London (1992) or the Love Parade in Berlin (1992), for example – appeared in magazines such as i-D, Spex, Interview, SZ Magazin and Butt, and established his reputation as a prominent witness of a contemporary social movement. He was made co-editor of Spex in 1997. For the Index Magazine, he shot covers and assignments, including images of John Waters, Gilbert & George, and Udo Kier.\\nTillmans was considered the “documentarian of his generation, especially that of the London club and gay scenes” (though he has said \"It was never my intention to be seen as diaristic or autobiographical. I was not recording the world around me or my tribe or whatever. There is a big misunderstanding there that still persists to this day.\"). Half of his work is staged, with the artist choosing the clothes and the location, as well as setting his models up in their positions. The series of his friends Lutz and Alex, also published in i-D in 1992, are considered important photographic documents of the 1990s. In his early photographs of people, Tillmans portrayed freedom in a different way and he says: \"I wanted to somehow represent what was not being represented elsewhere.\" From 1992 to 1994 Tillmans lived and worked in London, moving to New York in 1994. During this time, he began to show more frequently, developing an exhibition style that consisted of nonhierarchical arrangements of unframed photographs pinned or taped onto the gallery’s walls. Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, reaching almost to the ceiling and the floor. He views each exhibition as a site-specific installation, often addressing the exhibition space as a larger composition.\\n\\n\\n=== \"Pictures, in order to see the world\" ===\\nTillmans’ photographic practice subsequently developed to encompass a wide array of genres. His portraits, still lifes, sky photographs (e.g. the Concorde series), astrophotography, aerial shots and landscapes are motivated equally by aesthetic and political interests, especially related to homosexuality and gender identity. Tillmans says of his work: “I take pictures, in order to see the world.” He produces images for installations in three sizes, from small to very large, and either in signed, mounted prints, which must be protected in a frame, or as replaceable inkjet prints that can be attached directly to the wall (the latter generated by a certificate-authenticated optical disc). They are installed in meticulous wall installations, sometimes combined with photocopies, and magazine and newspaper clippings (for example, in the installation “Soldiers – The Nineties”); or presented in vitrines, arranged in extensive table-installations (“truth study center”). Operating on the basis of the fundamental equality of all motifs and supports, through this continual re-arranging, repositioning, questioning and reinforcement, Tillmans avoids ascribing any ‘conclusions’ to his work and thus subjects his photographic vision to a perpetual re-contextualization.\\nIn 2009, after Tillmans had been using an analog 50 mm Contax SLR camera almost exclusively for over two decades, he turned to digital photography. In 2012, he abandoned film altogether and became a full-time digital photographer. In an interview that year, he describes the corresponding change from using viewfinders to integrated camera monitors as \"completely turning on its head the psychology of photography, which has always been a dialogue between photographer, object and the imaginary image that one is envisioning, thinking, hoping for.\" According to Tillmans, the higher resolution of digital photographs correlates to \"a transformation in the whole world\"; he further explains: \"In recent years, everything has become HD, so I think it is inevitable that the overwhelming nature of this information density is reflected in my images. In this way, they again describe quite well my sense of perception today.\"\\nWolfgang has a passion and love for the streets and the clubs. Which this two inspire him in his work along with his work in the gay rights movement.(Jobey, 2010).\\n\\n\\n==== Grids ====\\nThe 56 photographs of equal dimensions that make up the Concorde Grid were taken in and around London as part of a commission for Tillmans’ exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery in 1997. Shot from a wide range of places, including private gardens, parks, railway tracks, and the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport, they record the daily passing of the airplane. Total Solar Eclipse Grid (1998), a set of which was included in his Turner Prize installation and is now in the permanent collection of the Tate, documents the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Each of the 21 photographs in the grid was taken during the eclipse of his immediate surroundings in a tropical locale, with varying degrees of light and detail. Snow/Ice Grid (1999) is a grid of images of trampled and melting ice and snow.\\n\\n\\n==== Abstractions ====\\n\\nTillmans exhibited his first abstract and damaged pictures as a Parkett edition in 1998. The edition, 60 unique works on color-negative photographic paper collected by the artist since he began colour printing in 1990, was a combination of true darkroom mistakes and years of darkroom experimentation that they inspired. The Silver works, which Tillmans has been creating since 1998, reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light, as well as mechanical and chemical processes. The name Silver arises from the dirt traces and silver salt stains that remain on the paper when the artist develops the photographs in a machine that is filled with water and has not been completely cleaned.\\nSince 2000, Tillmans has become increasingly interested in the chemical foundations of photographic material, as well as its haptic and spatial possibilities. The \"Conquistador\" series of photographs were the first of these interventions to be exhibited. Later works created directly in the darkroom without the use of a camera, and often largely accidental (e.g. \"Blushes,\" \"Mental Pictures,\" and \"Freischwimmer\"), present photography as a self-referential medium – one that could serve as an experimental ground for the creation of a new type of image structure. These “abstract” works now appear next to the figurative photographs. In \"Blushes,\" fine, thread-like lines, apparently drawn with light, swim over the surface of the photographic paper, and create delicate, fluid patterns.\\nTillmans further explores the bounds of photography as a medium in his “paper drop” series (2001–08). He started to make ‘paper drop’ images depicting photographic paper specifically exposed to coloured light in his darkroom in 2001. He creates extraordinary sculptural forms in photographic paper; then, by photographing them, returns them to the accustomed flatness of that medium. Photography’s step from ‘picture’ to ‘object’ is best demonstrated in the works from the “Lighter” Series (2005–08), in which the artist dropped the act of photographing and allowed the photographs - in their three-dimensional form – to only represent themselves, recalling his ongoing series \"Impossible Color\" (1996–present). These colourful photo-paper works are folded, creased or otherwise manipulated, allowing for a subtle play with the material surface and the resulting illusion of lines and contrast. Contained under plexiglas lids, they have a rather sculptural quality.\\n\\n\\n==== Photocopies ====\\n\\nTillman\\'s first exhibition in 1988 was composed exclusively of images that were created with the latest kind of monochrome laser copier. He regards these so-called Approach pictures (1987–1988) as his \"first work before [he] even owned a camera.\" Over the years, Tillmans has often returned to this medium. The ways that surface structure and image depth influence each other is shown in his large-format works whose original material is analogue photocopies (ongoing since 2006). Here he also references his earlier works from the end of the 1980s that he began in the course of experimenting with an old Canon photocopier.  The uncontrolled contrasts and pigment particles in the images from these old machines are clear only after drastic enlargement (framed ca. 260 x 180 cm). The resulting effects are distanced but also concrete – created through not only the materiality of the printing process but also the play and variation of scale. With the analogue photocopy – probably the most ephemeral form of image (re)production – a system of values for images is brought into a critical light.\\nCommissioned by Tate Modern, Tillmans was on-site throughout the development of the museum\\'s The Tanks galleries from 2012 until 2016, capturing each stage in a series of 176 shots. Turning his lens on building paraphernalia like scaffolding, walkie-talkies and sacks of cement, he manipulated his shots on an old photocopier that produces a single colour image after scanning a picture four times, ‘distorting and shifting the colours so that each one is a unique work’.\\n\\n\\n==== Table works (\"truth study center\") ====\\nIn 2005, at his major supporter Maureen Paley\\'s gallery, Tillmans showed his large-scale display-case installation Truth Study Center. Going even further than his wall-installations, Tillmans’ table works combine a diverse array of image formats and content. His own photographs are presented and arranged under glass next to extracts from books, newspapers, magazines, postcards, packaging and other found materials. The collage-like arrangements of the table displays produce an open-ness and potentiality in terms of aesthetics and content, while raising a critical question about the interpretive possibilities of the visible in a global information-society. With that, claims of absolute (in particular, religious) truth are caricatured, as if Tillmans would like to put them to a kind of test (“truth study center”). The works draw attention to the exercise of power behind the ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism, Catholicism, and capitalism.\\n\\n\\n=== Videos ===\\nIn 1987, Tillmans began making videos, and he has exhibited them since 2002. In most, the camera barely moves, the sound is direct, and the only cuts occur when the camera is turned on and off. Lights (Body) (2000–2002), a video installation featuring static shots of the light effects inside an empty dance club, with the bass pulse of the ‘Hacker Remix\\' of ‘Don\\'t be Light\\' by Air, is the first work by the photographer using the medium of film. The only indications of people on the crowded dance floor are the subtle vibrations and occasionally visible particles of dust. In 2002, Tillmans filmed a video clip for the pop band Pet Shop Boys’ single \"Home and Dry,\" composed almost entirely of shots documenting the mice living in the London Underground system. The film Kopierer (2010) depicts an open color laser copy machine, the CLC 1100, in the act of copying documents over a period of ten minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nIn 2001, Tillmans was awarded first prize in the competition for the design of the AIDS memorial for the City of Munich, whereupon the memorial was erected after his designs at the Sendlinger Tor.\\nIn 2015, Tillmans was commissioned with creating the official portrait of retiring British Museum director Neil MacGregor, which was subsequently acquired by the museum as the first photograph portrait in a tradition stretching back 250 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Music and art collaboration ===\\nIn 2011, Tillmans collaborated with The Opiates by offering a range of photographs to accompany their Hollywood Under the Knife album  and Rainy Days and Remixes EP.\\nA fan of the 1980s experimental synthpop group Colourbox, Tillmans curated an exhibition dedicated to the group, Music of the Band (1982 - 1987), at his Between Bridges gallery in 2014, and also selected the track list and provided original artwork for a tie-in compilation of the same name. The exhibition was the first to be held in the gallery\\'s dedicated Playback Room, where visitors can listen to Tillmans\\' music selections on high-end speakers.\\nIn 2016, Tillmans\\' track \"Device Control\" was included on American singer and rapper Frank Ocean\\'s video album Endless. After Ocean met with Tillmans to discuss the use of his photography for Ocean\\'s studio album Blonde, Tillmans sent Ocean two of his tracks after piquing his interest. Ocean later asked if he could sample the track, to which Tillmans agreed. Although Ocean was initially planning to only sample \"Device Control\", it was released in its entirety as an opening and ending of the video album.\\n\\n\\n=== Between Bridges ===\\nBetween Bridges is a non-profit exhibition space maintained by Tillmans in Berlin.\\nBetween April 2006 and late 2011, Tillmans maintained the exhibition space in the ground floor of his Bethnal Green studio, a former umbrella factory named Moarain House, at 223 Cambridge Heath Road, London. The project\\'s name is taken from a 1999 photograph by the artist, and also refers to the studio\\'s physical location between two rail bridges. The space opened with a show of works by the New York artist and activist David Wojnarowicz. In the small gallery Tillmans developed a program of exhibitions with political art from other artists who he believed had not been given the attention they deserved, specifically in London. Exhibitions were held of work by Jenny Holzer, Wolfgang Breuer, David Wojnarowicz, Corita Kent, Charlotte Posenenske, Isa Genzken, the films of Len Lye, and photographs from the Center for Land Use Interpretation.\\nFrom 2014 to 2019, Between Bridges was based at a former artist studio and gallery in Tiergarten, Berlin. In 2022, it relocated to a six-story corner building Tillmans designed and built in the Kreuzberg district.\\n\\n\\n== Tillmans\\' Experience with AIDS ==\\nTillmans contracted HIV at the age of 26 from his boyfriend Jochen Klein, a German painter and his collaborator on art during most of his life. Klein died from AIDS in 1997. Tillmans stated in his interview with the  SHOWStudio\\'s Lou Stoppard that after experiencing this he feels like life is fragile, and should not take advantage of it.\\nIn the interview with SHOWStudio\\'s Lou Stoppard, Tillmans talks about how some of his artwork has reflected how he felt about HIV and AIDS:\\n\\nTillmans\\' 2014 photograph, \"17 Years\\' Supply\", depicts a giant cardboard box filled with bottles of HIV drugs—some marked with Tillmans\\' own name. His work, as a whole, has also largely spoken to the LGBTQ experience: 2014\\'s \"Arms and Legs\" is an erotic close-up of a male hand slipped underneath another man\\'s red athletic shorts; 2012\\'s \"Juan Pablo & Karl, Chingaza\" features two men smoking and laying [sic] together on a bed of grass.\\nTo accompany an essay by Anthony Fauci, the New York Times asked Tillmans in 2022 to photograph Fauci — his first assignment for the newspaper. In addition to the photographs, the newspaper also published a conversation between Tillmans and Fauci on HIV.\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nWolfgang Tillmans. Cologne: Taschen, 1995, 2002.

In 1995 his work was included at a show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Tillmans\\' work has since been shown in large solo exhibitions at European museums, for example the Kunsthalle Zürich (1995), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid (1998), Museum Ludwig in Cologne (2001), Castello di Rivoli in Italy (2002), Palais de Tokyo in Paris (2002), the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (2008), and Serpentine Gallery in London (2010).\\nTate Britain\\'s extensive mid-career retrospective of Tillmans’ work was shown in 2003. In 2006, MoMA PS1 presented Tillmans\\' first exhibition for an American museum. That same year, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles mounted Tillman\\'s first major retrospective in the US, which travelled to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C. His first South American exhibition was shown at the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art in 2012. In 2005 and in 2009, Tillmans was included in the Venice Biennale.\\nIn 2004, the Portikus, Frankfurt, invited Tillmans to curate \"Inventory / Scott King / Donald Urquhart\", an exhibition presenting three artistic positions from London. The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, entrusted Tillmans with the role of a guest curator in 2008, inviting him to present a personal choice of works by Isa Genzken, Roberto Matta, and Ellsworth Kelly from the museum\\'s collection.\\nTillmans carefully designs his exhibitions, in which printed, audiovisual and sometimes textile materials interact with the space they are exhibited in. This preoccupation, together with a rigorous attention to detail (as the pins, clips and tape used for hanging the pictures), has led him to have a dedicated team for setting up his exhibitions. The members of this team are Danish sculptor Anders Clausen, Chilean biologist and architect Federico Martelli (since 2006), and Colombian artist Juan Echeverri (since 2012).\\n\\n\\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\\nKunsthalle Zürich, 1995 (exh. cat.)\\nPortikus, Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1995 (exh. cat.)\\nI Didn\\'t Inhale, Chisenhale Gallery, London, 1997.\\nIsa Genzken, Wolfgang Tillmans, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany, 2001 (exh. cat.)\\nView from Above/Aufsicht, Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany, 2001\\nVue d\\'en Haut, Palais de Tokyo, Paris, 2002; Veduta dall\\'alto, Castle of Rivoli/Museo d\\'Arte Contemporanea, Rivoli, Italy, 2002 (exh. cat.)\\nFrans Hals Museum, Haarlem, Netherlands\\nif one thing matters, everything matters, Tate Britain, London, 2003 (exh. cat.)\\nView From Above, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebœk, Denmark, 2003 (exh. cat.)\\nWolfgang Tillmans, Regen Projects, Los Angeles, 2004\\nFreedom From The Known, MoMA PS1, New York, 2006 (exh. cat.); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington DC, 2007 (exh. cat.); Pinakothek der Moderne (permanent collection), Munich\\nBeugung, Kunstverein München, Munich, 2007\\nLighter, Hamburger Bahnhof Museum fur Gegenwart, Berlin, 2008 (exh. cat.); Museo Tamayo, Mexico City, Mexico\\nSerpentine Gallery, London, 2010 (exh. cat.)\\nModerna Museet, Stockholm, 2012\\nMuseo de Arte del Banco de la República, Bogotá, 2012\\nStedelijk Room, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 2012 (permanent exhibition as part of the collection)\\nNew World, Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York, 2013\\nBook for Architects, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2015\\nYour Body is Yours, National Museum of Art, Osaka, Osaka, 2015\\nPCR, David Zwirner Gallery, New York, 2015\\nWolfgang Tillmans: 2017, Tate Modern, London, 2017.\\nWolfgang Tillmans: Fragile Johannesburg Art Gallery, Johannesburg, 2018\\nWolfgang Tillmans: How likely is it that only I am right in this matter?, David Zwirner, New York\\nWolfgang Tillmans: Today is the first day Wiels, Brussels, 2020\\nSound is Liquid Mumok, Vienna, 2021/22\\nWolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear, Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2022–2023\\nWolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 2023\\n\\n\\n=== Group exhibitions ===\\nManifesta 10, St. Petersburg, Russia, 2014\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\nFollowing a guest professorship at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg from 1998 to 1999 and an Honorary Fellowship at the Arts University Bournemouth in 2001, Tillmans was a professor for Interdisciplinary Art at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main from 2003 to 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropic activities ===\\nIn 2011, he travelled to Haiti with the charity Christian Aid to document reconstruction work after the country\\'s devastating earthquake one year before.\\nBetween 2009 and 2014, Tillmans served as an Artist Trustee of the Tate Board.

       "  'Anselm Kiefer (born 8 March 1945) is a German painter and sculptor. He studied with Peter Dreher and Horst Antes at the end of the 1960s. His works incorporate materials such as straw, ash, clay, lead, and shellac. The poems of Paul Celan have played a role in developing Kiefer\\'s themes of German history and the horrors of the Holocaust, as have the spiritual concepts of Kabbalah.\\nIn his entire body of work, Kiefer argues with the past and addresses taboo and controversial issues from recent history. Themes from Nazi rule are particularly reflected in his work; for instance, the painting Margarethe (oil and straw on canvas) was inspired by Celan\\'s well-known poem \"Todesfuge\" (\"Death Fugue\").\\nHis works are characterised by an unflinching willingness to confront his culture\\'s dark past, and unrealised potential, in works that are often done on a large, confrontational scale well suited to the subjects. It is also characteristic of his work to find signatures and names of people of historical importance, legendary figures or historical places. All of these are encoded sigils through which Kiefer seeks to process the past; this has resulted in his work being linked with the movements New Symbolism and Neo–Expressionism.\\nKiefer has lived and worked in France since 1992. Since 2008, he has lived and worked primarily in Paris. In 2018, he was awarded Austrian citizenship.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and career ==\\nThe son of a German art teacher, Kiefer was born in Donaueschingen a few months before the end of World War II. His city having been heavily bombed, Kiefer grew up surrounded by the devastation of the war. In 1951, his family moved to Ottersdorf, and he attended public school in Rastatt, graduating high school in 1965. He studied at the University of Freiburg, studying pre-law and Romance languages. However, after three semesters he switched to art, studying at art academies in Freiburg and Karlsruhe. In Karlsruhe, he studied under Peter Dreher, a realist and figurative painter. He received an art degree in 1969.\\nIn 1971 Kiefer moved to Hornbach (Walldürn) and established a studio. He remained in the Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis until 1992; his output during this first creative time is known as The German Years. In 1992 he relocated to France.\\nKiefer left his first wife and children in Germany on his move to Barjac in 1992. From 2008 he lived in Paris, in a large house in the Marais district, with his second wife, the Austrian photographer Renate Graf, and their two children. Kiefer and Graf divorced in 2014.\\nIn 2017, Kiefer was ranked one of the richest 1,001 individuals and families in Germany by the monthly business publication Manager Magazin.\\nKiefer is the subject of the 3D documentary film Anselm (2023), directed by Wim Wenders.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic process ==\\nGenerally, Kiefer attributes traditional mythology, books, and libraries as his main subjects and sources of inspiration. In his middle years, his inspiration came from literary figures, namely Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. His later works incorporate themes from Judeo-Christian, ancient Egyptian, and Oriental cultures, which he combines with other motifs. Cosmogony is also a large focus in his works. In all, Kiefer searches for the meaning of existence and \"representation of the incomprehensible and the non-representational.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Philosophy ===\\nKiefer values a \"spiritual connection\" with the materials he works with, \"extracting the spirit that already lives within [them].\" In doing so, he transforms his materials with acid baths and physical blows with sticks and axes, among other processes.\\nHe often chooses materials for their alchemical properties—lead in particular. Kiefer\\'s initial attraction to lead arose when he had to repair aging pipes in the first house he owned. Eventually, he came to admire its physical and sensory qualities and began to discover more about its connection to alchemy. Physically, Kiefer specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he sees many colors, especially gold, which he associates to the symbolic gold sought by alchemists.\\nKiefer\\'s use of straw in his work represents energy. He claims this is due to straw\\'s physical qualities, including the color gold and its release of energy and heat when burned. The resulting ash makes way for new creation, thus echoing the motifs of transformation and the cycle of life.\\nKiefer also values the balance between order and chaos in his work, stating, \"[I]f there is too much order, [the piece] is dead; or if there is much chaos, it doesn\\'t cohere.\" In addition, he cares deeply about the space in which his works reside. He states that his works \"lose their power completely\" if put in the wrong spaces.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nKiefer began his career creating performances and documenting them in photographs titled Occupations and Heroische Sinnbilder (Heroic Symbols).  Dressed in his father\\'s Wehrmacht uniform, Kiefer mimicked the Nazi salute in various locations in France, Switzerland and Italy. He asked Germans to remember and to acknowledge the loss to their culture through the mad xenophobia of the Third Reich. In 1969, at Galerie am Kaiserplatz, Karlsruhe, he presented his first single exhibition \"Besetzungen (Occupations)\" with a series of photographs of controversial political actions.\\n\\n\\n=== Painting and sculpture ===\\nKiefer is best known for his paintings, which have grown increasingly large in scale with additions of lead, broken glass, and dried flowers or plants. This results in encrusted surfaces and thick layers of impasto.\\nBy 1970, while studying informally under Joseph Beuys at Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, his stylistic leanings resembled Georg Baselitz\\'s approach. He worked with glass, straw, wood and plant parts. The use of these materials meant that his art works became temporary and fragile, as Kiefer himself was well aware; he also wanted to showcase the materials in such a way that they were not disguised and could be represented in their natural form. The fragility of his work contrasts with the stark subject matter in his paintings. This use of familiar materials to express ideas was influenced by Beuys, who used fat and carpet felt in his works. It is also typical of the Neo-Expressionist style.\\nKiefer returned to the area of his birthplace in 1971. In the years that followed, he incorporated German mythology in particular in his work, and in the next decade he studied the Kabbalah, as well as Qabalists like Robert Fludd. He went on extended journeys throughout Europe, the US and the Middle East; the latter two journeys further influenced his work. Besides paintings, Kiefer created sculptures, watercolors, photographs, and woodcuts, using woodcuts in particular to create a repertoire of figures he could reuse repeatedly in all media over the next decades, lending his work its knotty thematic coherence.\\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Kiefer made numerous paintings, watercolors, woodcuts, and books on themes interpreted by Richard Wagner in his four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung).\\nIn the early 1980s, he created more than thirty paintings, painted photographs, and watercolors that refer in their titles and inscriptions to the Romanian Jewish writer Paul Celan\\'s poem \"Todesfuge\" (\"Death Fugue\").\\nA series of paintings which Kiefer executed between 1980 and 1983 depict looming stone edifices, referring to famous examples of National Socialist architecture, particularly buildings designed by Albert Speer and Wilhelm Kreis. The grand plaza in To the Unknown Painter (1983) specifically refers to the outdoor courtyard of Hitler\\'s Chancellery in Berlin, designed by Speer in 1938 in honor of the Unknown Soldier. In 1984–85, he made a series of works on paper incorporating manipulated black-and-white photographs of desolate landscapes with utility poles and power lines. Such works, like Heavy Cloud (1985), were an indirect response to the controversy in West Germany in the early 1980s about NATO\\'s stationing of tactical nuclear missiles on German soil and the placement of nuclear fuel processing facilities.\\nBy the mid-1980s, Kiefer\\'s themes widened from a focus on Germany\\'s role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involved not only national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. During the 1980s his paintings became more physical, and featured unusual textures and materials. The range of his themes broadened to include references to ancient Hebrew and Egyptian history, as in the large painting Osiris and Isis (1985–87). His paintings of the 1990s, in particular, explore the universal myths of existence and meaning rather than those of national identity. From 1995 to 2001, he produced a cycle of large paintings of the cosmos.\\nOver the years Kiefer has made many unusual works, but one work stands out among the rest as particularly bizarre—that work being his 20 Years of Solitude piece. Taking over 20 years to create (1971–1991), 20 Years of Solitude is a ceiling-high stack of hundreds of white-painted ledgers and handmade books, strewn with dirt and dried vegetation, whose pages are stained with the artist\\'s semen. The word solitude in the title references the artists frequent masturbation onto paper during the 20 years it took to create. He asked American art critic Peter Schjeldahl to write a text for a catalog of the masturbation books. Schjeldahl attempted to oblige but ultimately failed in his endeavor. No other critic would take on the task, so the work has largely faded into obscurity.\\nHe would shock the art world yet again at a dinner party in May 1993. Kiefer and his second wife, Renate Graf, decorated a candlelit commercial loft in New York with white muslin, carpeted the floor with white sand, and staffed it with waiters dressed as mimes with white-face. A handful of art world elite, such as the likes of Sherrie Levine, were served several courses of arcane organ meats, such as pancreas, that were mostly white in color. Not surprisingly, the guests did not find the meal to be particularly appetizing.\\nSince 2002, Kiefer has worked with concrete, creating the towers destined for the Pirelli warehouses in Milan, the series of tributes to Velimir Khlebnikov (paintings of the sea, with boats and an array of leaden objects, 2004–5), a return to the work of Paul Celan with a series of paintings featuring rune motifs (2004–06), and other sculptures. In 2003, he held his first solo show at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Salzburg Villa Katz, Anselm Kiefer: Am Anfang dedicated to a series of new works, centered on the recurring themes of history and myths. In 2005, he held his second exhibition in Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac\\'s Salzburg location, Für Paul Celan which focused on Kiefer\\'s preoccupation with the book, linking references to Germanic mythology with the poetry of Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jew from Czernowitz. The exhibition featured eleven works on canvas, a series of bound books shown in display cases, and five sculptures, including one powerful, monumental outdoor sculpture of reinforced concrete and lead elements, two leaden piles of books combined with bronze sunflowers, lead ships and wedges, and two monumental leaden books from the series The Secret Life of Plants. The exhibition toured to Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris and Galerie Yvon Lambert, Paris, the following year.\\nIn 2006, Kiefer\\'s exhibition, Velimir Chlebnikov, was first shown in a small studio near Barjac, then moved to White Cube in London, then finishing in the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Connecticut. The work consists of 30 large (2 × 3 meters) paintings, hanging in two banks of 15 on facing walls of an expressly constructed corrugated steel building that mimics the studio in which they were created. The work refers to the eccentric theories of the Russian futurist philosopher/poet Velimir Chlebnikov, who invented a \"language of the future\" called \"Zaum\", and who postulated that cataclysmic sea battles shift the course of history once every 317 years. In his paintings, Kiefer\\'s toy-like battleships—misshapen, battered, rusted and hanging by twisted wires—are cast about by paint and plaster waves. The work\\'s recurrent color notes are black, white, gray, and rust; and their surfaces are rough and slathered with paint, plaster, mud and clay.\\nIn 2007, he became the first artist to be commissioned to install a permanent work at the Louvre, Paris, since Georges Braque some 50 years earlier. The same year, he inaugurated the Monumenta exhibitions series at the Grand Palais in Paris, with works paying special tribute to the poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann.\\nIn 2009 Kiefer mounted two exhibitions at the White Cube gallery in London. A series of forest diptychs and triptychs enclosed in glass vitrines, many filled with dense Moroccan thorns, was titled Karfunkelfee, a term from German Romanticism stemming from a poem by the post-war Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann. In The Fertile Crescent, Kiefer presented a group of epic paintings inspired by a trip to India fifteen years earlier where he first encountered rural brick factories. Over the past decade, the photographs that Kiefer took in India \"reverberated\" in his mind to suggest a vast array of cultural and historical references, reaching from the first human civilization of Mesopotamia to the ruins of Germany in the aftermath of the Second World War, where he played as a boy. \"Anyone in search of a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\", wrote the historian Simon Schama in his catalogue essay, \"would do well to look hard at Kiefer\\'s The Fertile Crescent\".\\nIn Morgenthau Plan (2012), the gallery is filled with a sculpture of a golden wheat field, enclosed in a five-meter-high steel cage. That same year, Kiefer inaugurated Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac\\'s gallery space in Pantin, with an exhibition of monumental new works, Die Ungeborenen. The exhibition was accompanied by a publication with a letter by Anselm Kiefer and essays by Alexander Kluge and Emmanuel Daydé. He continues to be represented by the gallery and participates in group and solo exhibitions at their various locations.\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nIn 1969 Kiefer began to design books. Early examples are typically worked-over photographs; his more recent books consist of sheets of lead layered with paint, minerals, or dried plant matter. For example, he assembled numerous lead books on steel shelves in libraries, as symbols of the stored, discarded knowledge of history. The book Rhine (1981) comprises a sequence of 25 woodcuts that suggest a journey along the Rhine River; the river is central to Germany\\'s geographical and historical development, acquiring an almost mythic significance in works such as Wagner\\'s Ring of the Nibelungs. Scenes of the unspoiled river are interrupted by dark, swirling pages that represent the sinking of the battleship Bismarck in 1941, during an Atlantic sortie codenamed Rhine Exercise.\\n\\n\\n=== Studios ===\\nKiefer\\'s first large studio was in the attic of his home, a former schoolhouse in Hornbach. Years later he installed his studio in a factory building in Buchen, near Hornbach. In 1988, Kiefer transformed a former brick factory in Höpfingen (also near Buchen) into an extensive artwork including numerous installations and sculptures. In 1991, after twenty years of working in the Odenwald, the artist left Germany to travel around the world—to India, Mexico, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States. In 1992 he established himself in Barjac, France, where he transformed his 35-hectare studio compound La Ribaute into a Gesamtkunstwerk. A derelict silk factory, his studio is enormous and in many ways is a comment on industrialization. He created an extensive system of glass buildings, archives, installations, storerooms for materials and paintings, subterranean chambers and corridors.\\nSophie Fiennes filmed Kiefer\\'s studio complex in Barjac for her documentary study Over Your Cities Grass Will Grow (2010), which recorded both the environment and the artist at work. One critic wrote of the film: \"Building almost from the ground up in a derelict silk factory, Kiefer devised an artistic project extending over acres: miles of corridors, huge studio spaces with ambitious landscape paintings and sculptures that correspond to monumental constructions in the surrounding woodland, and serpentine excavated labyrinths with great earthy columns that resemble stalagmites or termite mounds. Nowhere is it clear where the finished product definitively stands; perhaps it is all work in progress, a monumental concept-art organism.\"\\nDuring 2008, Kiefer left his studio complex at Barjac and moved to Paris. A fleet of 110 lorries transported his work to a 35,000 sq ft (3,300 m2) warehouse in Croissy-Beaubourg, outside of Paris, that had once been the depository for the La Samaritaine department store. A journalist wrote of Kiefer\\'s abandoned studio complex: \"He left behind the great work of Barjac – the art and buildings. A caretaker looks after it. Uninhabited, it quietly waits for nature to take over, because, as we know, over our cities grass will grow. Kiefer spent the summer of 2019 living and working at Barjac.\"\\n\\n\\n== List of Works ==\\nSource:\\n\\nThe Second Sinful Fall of Parmenides (Der zweite Sündenfall des Parmenides), 1969.

(2006); the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2007). In 2007, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao presented an extensive survey of recent work. Several of his works were exhibited in 2009 for the first time in the Balearic Islands, in the museum Es Baluard in Palma de Mallorca. In 2012, the Art Gallery of Hamilton presented some of his paintings. London\\'s Royal Academy of Arts mounted the first British retrospective of the artist\\'s work in September 2014.\\nIn 2007 Kiefer was commissioned to create a huge site-specific installation of sculptures and paintings for the inaugural \"Monumenta\" at the Grand Palais, Paris. With the unveiling of a triptych – the mural Athanor and the two sculptures Danae and Hortus Conclusus – at the Louvre in 2007, Kiefer became the first living artist to create a permanent site-specific installation in the museum since Georges Braque in 1953.\\nIn 2008, Kiefer installed Palmsonntag (Palm Sunday) (2006), a monumental palm tree and 36 steel-and-glass reliquary tablets in the auditorium-gym of the First Baptist Church of Los Angeles, an enormous Spanish Gothic edifice built in 1927. The room was reconfigured to accommodate the work. Floors were sanded to remove the basketball court\\'s markings, and the wall for the reliquary paintings was constructed inside the space. In 2010 the piece was installed at the Art Gallery of Ontario museum in Toronto, where Kiefer created eight new panels specifically for the AGO\\'s exhibition of this work.\\nIn Next Year in Jerusalem (2010) at Gagosian Gallery, Kiefer explained that each of the works was a reaction to a personal \"shock\" initiated by something he had recently heard of.\\nIn September 2013, The Hall Art Foundation, in partnership with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, opened a long-term installation of sculpture and paintings in a specifically repurposed, 10,000 square-foot building on the MASS MoCA campus. In 2014, the Foundation landscaped the area surrounding this building in order to present long-term installations of outdoor sculpture. The long-term exhibition—includes Étroits sont les Vaisseaux (Narrow are the Vessels) (2002), an 82-foot long, undulating wave-like sculpture made of cast concrete, exposed rebar, and lead; The Women of the Revolution (Les Femmes de la Revolution) (1992), composed of more than twenty lead beds with photographs and wall text; Velimir Chlebnikov (2004), a steel pavilion containing 30 paintings dealing with nautical warfare and inspired by the quixotic theories of the Russian mathematical experimentalist Velimir Chlebnikov; and a new, large-format photograph on lead created by the artist for the installation at MASS MoCA.\\nIn 2015, the Centre Pompidou, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, and the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig hosted a retrospective exhibition in honor of Kiefer\\'s 70th birthday.\\nIn 2016 the Albertina in Vienna dedicated an exhibition to his woodcuts, showing 35 made between 1977 and 2015, with an accompanying catalogue.\\nHe unveiled his first public art commission in the United States in May 2018, at Rockefeller Center. The Uraeus sculpture was inspired in part by the religious symbols of Egypt and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It was put on view until 22 July.\\n\\n\\n== Recognitions ==\\nIn 1990, Kiefer was awarded the Wolf Prize. In 1999 the Japan Art Association awarded him the Praemium Imperiale for his lifetime achievements. In the explanatory statement it reads:\\n\"A complex critical engagement with history runs through Anselm Kiefer\\'s work. His paintings as well as the sculptures of Georg Baselitz created an uproar at the 1980 Venice Biennale: the viewers had to decide whether the apparent Nazi motifs were meant ironically or whether the works were meant to convey actual fascist ideas. Kiefer worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatized nation and a vexed, divided world. He created epic paintings on giant canvases that called up the history of German culture with the help of depictions of figures such as Richard Wagner or Goethe, thus continuing the historical tradition of painting as a medium of addressing the world. Only a few contemporary artists have such a pronounced sense of art\\'s duty to engage the past and the ethical questions of the present, and are in the position to express the possibility of the absolution of guilt through human effort.\"\\nIn 2008, Kiefer was awarded the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, given for the first time to a visual artist. Art historian Werner Spies said in his speech that Kiefer is a passionate reader who takes impulses from literature for his work. In 2011 Kiefer was appointed to the chair of creativity in art at the Collège de France.\\n\\n\\n== Materials ==\\nDue to the spontaneous nature of his creative process, many of his works have issues regarding stability—a concern shared by collectors, dealers, and curators alike. He acknowledges the issue, but says change is part of the process and that their essence will ultimately stay the same. This idea of transformation has a kind of appeal for Kiefer and thus is featured in many of his works. This fascination for the process may have stemmed from the artist\\'s keen interest in alchemy. He often chooses materials for their alchemical properties—lead in particular being chief among them. In the case of lead, he specifically likes how the metal looks during the heating and melting process when he would see many colors—especially that of gold—which he thought of in a symbolic sense as the gold sought by alchemists. He is also particularly fond of the oxidation of white on lead. He would often try to induce oxidation artificially with the use of acid to speed up the process. Lead was also associated with the alchemical concepts of magic numbers and represented the planet Saturn.\\nShellac, another material popular in his work, corresponded to lead in terms of how he felt about its color and energy possibilities. He also liked that while being polished it takes on energy and becomes warm to the touch.\\nThe use of straw in his work is also in part the result of this common theme of energy. Straw again features the color gold and gives off energy, heat, and warmth when burned. This would make way for new creation thus continuing the cycle of life through the transformation process.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nA new worldwide record was set for the artist when the painting To the Unknown Painter (1983) sold by $3,554,500 at Christie\\'s New York, on 11 May 2011, to an American private collector. The previous record was held by Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom (1999), who had sold by $3,549,350 at Christie\\'s London, on 8 February 2007.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nKiefer\\'s works are included in numerous public collections, including the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin; the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit; the Tate Modern, London; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh; the High Museum of Art, Atlanta; the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; the Tel Aviv Museum of Art; and the Albertina, Vienna. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York owns 20 of the artist\\'s rare watercolors. Notable private collectors include Eli Broad and Andrew J.

Holland is known for creating a style of art that may use fiberglass (or fibreglass), aluminum (or aluminium), epoxy paint, plywood, beads, oil paint,  palette knives, marble, copper, paper, and clay. For clay he uses watercolor, acrylic urethane, and ceramic glazes.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nHolland began his formal art education at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was influenced by David Park before traveling to Chile as a Fulbright Grant recipient.

It wasn\\'t until Holland began to work with aluminum that he achieved critical acclaim. His work has been described as taking inspiration from Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism, and he has been called one of California\\'s most important contemporary artists and was featured in Art in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1945–1980: An Illustrated History.\\nHolland works primarily with fiberglass and aluminum to create free-standing and wall installations, a style that has been said to encompass Abstract Expressionism (8). He creates his art by riveting metal to the fiberglass or aluminum, then using epoxy paint to add other elements to the piece which add depth, light, and color. His work has been labeled exhilarating and visually challenging, playing games and distorting the three-dimensional space.

       "  'Martin Kippenberger (25 February 1953 – 7 March 1997) was a German artist known for his extremely prolific output in a wide range of styles and media, superfiction as well as his provocative, jocular and hard-drinking public persona.\\nKippenberger was \"widely regarded as one of the most talented German artists of his generation,\" according to Roberta Smith of the New York Times. He was at the center of a generation of German enfants terribles including Albert Oehlen, Markus Oehlen, Werner Büttner, Georg Herold, Dieter Göls, and Günther Förg.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n \\n\\nKippenberger was born in Dortmund in 1953, the only boy in a family with five children, with two elder and two younger sisters. His father was director of the Katharina-Elisabeth colliery, his mother a dermatologist. When Kippenberger\\'s mother was killed by a pallet falling off a truck, he inherited enough money to live on. He studied at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where Sigmar Polke, despite not teaching him directly, influenced him. After a sojourn in Florence, where he had his first solo show in 1977, he settled in Berlin in 1978. In that year he founded Kippenberger\\'s Office with Gisela Capitain, mounting exhibitions of his own art and that of his friends. During that same period, Kippenberger also became business director of SO36, a performance, film and music space, and started a punk band called the Grugas, which recorded a single called Luxus with Christine Hahn and Eric Mitchell. Leaving Berlin, originally for a long visit to Paris, Kippenberger spent the early 1980s as an active member of the Cologne art scene.\\nIn Cologne, as elsewhere, Kippenberger did not limit himself to producing works of art; he worked on how the art was presented, the framework and the sideshows. \"Martin was tremendously committed to the gallery\\'s artists,\" Max Hetzler said. The Vienna gallerist Peter Pakesch thinks Kippenberger did an enormous amount for the Hetzler Gallery\\'s success in his double role \"as clown and strategist... Max without Martin\\'s strategy would have been unimaginable in the early years.\" According to artist Jutta Koether, Kippenberger \"was the one who brought movement to life so that it became known outside Cologne.\"\\nIn 1984, he became a founding member of the Lord Jim Lodge. After moving to Los Angeles in late 1989, he bought a 35% share in ownership of the Italian restaurant Capri in Venice, Los Angeles. He stayed in Sankt Georgen im Schwarzwald as a guest of the Grässlin family of art collectors from 1980 to 1981, and later on and off from 1991 to 1994, in order to work but also to recover from his excessive life. In his last years he taught at the Städelschule and the Kassel Art Academy.\\nMartin Kippenberger died at age 44 from liver cancer at the Vienna General Hospital.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nKippenberger’s refusal to adopt a specific style and medium in which to disseminate his images resulted in an extremely prolific and varied oeuvre which includes an amalgam of sculpture, paintings, works on paper, photographs, installations, prints and ephemera.\\nThroughout the 1980s, Kippenberger’s artwork underwent periods of strong political reflection. During a trip to Brazil in 1986, Kippenberger bought a gas station by the sea in Salvador de Bahia and renamed it the Martin Bormann Gas Station. With the fictionally acquired gas station, Kippenberger gave Martin Bormann a camouflage address and the possibility of an income in exile; Kippenberger allegedly installed a telephone line and employees were obliged to answer calls with ‘Tankstelle Martin Bormann’. Later accused of neo-Nazi attitudes by German critic Wolfgang Max Faust, he made several life-size, dressed mannequin sculptures of himself, called Martin, ab in die Ecke und schäm Dich (Martin, into the Corner, You Should Be Ashamed of Yourself) (1989), placed facing the wall.\\nKippenberger also felt that he was working in the face of a \\'perceived death of painting\\' and his art reflects his struggle with the concept that, at the turn of the millennium, it was impossible to produce anything original or authentic. Blass vor Neid steht er vor deiner Tür [Pale with Envy, He Stands Outside Your Door] (1981), for instance, comprises twenty-one individual canvases shown together as one work, but each canvas has a separate title and there is no consistent style. In 1987 he integrated a 1972, all-gray abstract painting by Gerhard Richter, which he himself had purchased, into the top of a coffee table. For the photorealist paintings from a series titled Lieber Maler, Male Mir or Dear Painter, Paint Me, Kippenberger hired a commercial painter named Werner to make them and signed them Werner Kippenberger. Untitled [The installation of the White Paintings] make formal reference to debates around language-based conceptual art as a critique of the ‘empty’ white cube gallery space. In a first series of works alluding to Picasso that were to follow in 1988, Kippenberger took this project further, looking to the ultimate Modern icon as a contemporary foil. Restaging a well-known photograph by David Douglas Duncan of Picasso standing in a \\'puffed-up\\' state of undress on the steps of Château Vauvenargues in 1962 Kippenberger was parodying his famous antecedent, playfully subverting the machismo associated with the genre of self-portraiture. First adopted as a motif in his 1988 series of self-portraits undertaken in Carmona, Spain, Kippenberger depicted himself with white briefs pulled up high over his exaggerated belly, as he turned to examine himself in a mirror.\\nKippenberger made the first of Laterne (Lamp) sculptures in 1988, a year that he spent largely living in Seville and Madrid in Spain. This work, Laterne an Betrunkene (\\'Street Lamp for Drunks\\') has become well known through its exhibition at the 1988 Venice Biennale. The original motif of the lamp sculptures derived in part from the photographs that filled Kippenberger\\'s 1988 artist\\'s book, \"Psychobuildings\".\\nIn 1989, Kippenberger and fellow artist Jeff Koons worked together on an issue of the art journal Parkett; the following year, Koons designed an exhibition poster for Kippenberger.\\nIn 1990, while sojourning in New York City, Kippenberger started a body of work collectively known as the Latex or Rubber paintings. Also in the 1990s, influenced by the Lost Art Movement, Kippenberger had the idea of an underground network encircling the whole world. Located on the Greek island of Syros and in Dawson City, Canada, false subway entrances are part of the Metro-Net World Connection series (1993–7) Kippenberger built as private commissions; a sizable length of subway grating, complete with the sounds of trains and gusts of wind, was exhibited posthumously at the Venice Biennale.\\nThe Happy End of Franz Kafka’s ‘Amerika’ (1994) explores the fictional utopia of universal employment, adapting Kafka’s idea of communal job interviews into an artwork. The installation consists of a diverse assortment of objects and furniture, assembled to suggest a playing field for conducting mass interviews. There are over 40 tables and twice as many chairs, from classics of twentieth-century design, such as chairs by Arne Jacobsen and Charles Eames, to worn-out tables bought in flea markets, remnants of previous Kippenberger exhibitions, and even work by other artists.\\nDuring the last 10 years of his life Kippenberger created a series of drawings on hotel stationery, which are commonly referred to as the \\'hotel drawings\\' (1987–1997). Originally undertaken as ad hoc preparatory diagrams for the three-dimensional Peter sculptures, he later used the myriad letterheads of innumerable hotels to capture other subjects and inspirations. Collected in his travels, Kippenberger conceived them in thematic series (portraits of scientists, portraits of Frank Sinatra, depictions of war etc.). His late collages incorporate photographs (Polaroids, film stills, magazine clips), prints (one by Sigmar Polke), exhibition posters from past Kippenberger shows, some folded up origami-style, self-produced decals, and photographed and rephotographed drawings. Executed in 1996 as part of the series, Untitled offers a depiction of Kippenberger standing side by side with his daughter Helena as a little girl.\\nIn the final two series, Kippenberger first can be seen posing like Picasso’s last wife, Jacqueline, subtitling the piece The Paintings Pablo Couldn’t Paint Anymore. In the complex of lithographs entitled Medusa (1996), Kippenberger used photography as his starting point although, this time, he himself posed for wife and photographer Elfie Semotan, mimicking the postures of the characters in the famous painting The Raft of the Medusa (1819) by Théodore Géricault (1791-1824).\\nIn 2011, Kippenberger\\'s When It Starts Dripping From the Ceiling was accidentally destroyed by a janitor in a Dortmund museum who believed she was cleaning stains off of the work.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1985, Kippenberger exhibited \"Buying America and Selling El Salvador\" at Metro Pictures Ltd in New York, a large installation comprising numerous sculptural works. Although he had his first museum exhibition at Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt in 1986, he drew greater attention from institutions outside Germany, with exhibitions at the Centre Pompidou in Paris (1993) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1994).\\nKippenberger\\'s artistic reputation and influence has grown since his death. In 2003, he represented Germany at the Venice Biennale (with Candida Höfer). He has since been the subject of several large retrospective exhibitions, including at the Tate Modern in 2006 and \"the Problem Perspective\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2008; the exhibition traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2009. In 2011, the Museo Picasso Malaga hosted \\'Kippenberger Meets Picasso\\'. This exhibition showed how Kippenbeger was interested in Pablo Picasso, an artistic attraction resulted in works, and entire series, that were direct references to the Spanish artist.\\nIn 2013 the newly founded Greek Organization for Culture and Development, NEON, presented the work of the German artist in the exhibition A Cry for Freedom, curated by Dimitris Paleocrassas at the Museum of Cycladic Art, in Athens, Greece with works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection and the Estate Martin Kippenberger, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne. The exhibition presented over 60 works including paintings, sculptures, hotel drawings and photographs, and is the first time that Kippenberger’s work will be displayed in a museum environment in Greece.\\n\\nKippenberger collected and commissioned work by many of his peers: some of his exhibition posters were designed by such prominent artists as Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Rosemarie Trockel and Mike Kelley.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nWhile Kippenberger\\'s star has risen steadily since his death, his market has evolved in several distinct stages. His work was only considered auction-worthy toward the very end of his life, and even then, it rarely sold for more than $10,000. Only in spring 2005 at Phillips de Pury & Company, an untitled 1991 painting sold for $1,024,000. In 2011, Kippenberger\\'s lamp sculpture Untitled (1990) was sold for £1,329,250 ($2,094,898) at Christie\\'s London.\\nKippenberger\\'s self-portraits have in the past achieved the highest prices. In 2012, an untitled self-portrait sold for £3.2 million ($5.1 million) at a Christie\\'s London Evening sale. In 2014, Kippenberger’s untitled 1988 self-portrait, restaging a photograph of the 81-year-old Picasso in his white underwear taken by David Douglas Duncan, fetched $18.6 million. Later that year, Larry Gagosian bought a 1988 self-portrait by Kippenberger, which shows the artist in his underwear, for $22.5 million at Christie\\'s in New York.\\nKippenberger is represented by Galerie Gisela Capitain, with representation by Skarstedt, New York in the United States. \\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nKippenberger\\'s art garnered some recognition in the mid-nineties when three pieces were used by Welsh alternative rock music group Manic Street Preachers as the cover artwork on the three singles released from their third album, The Holy Bible, in 1994: part four of the five-part Fliegender Tanga (\"Flying Tanga\"), which would be sold for £2,561,250 in 2010, was used for the first single \"Faster/P.C.P.\"; a 1983 piece, Sympatische Kommunistin (\"Nice Communist Woman\"), appeared on part one of the two-part single \"Revol\"; and, Titten, Türme, Tortellini (\"Tits, Towers, Tortellini\"), credited under its French title \"Des tètons, des tours, des tortellini\", was the cover artwork on both parts of the two-part, third single \"She Is Suffering\".\\nIn 2008, during an exhibition at the Museion in Bozen, Italy, a sculpture by Kippenberger depicting a toad being crucified called Zuerst die Füsse (\"First the Feet\") was condemned by Pope Benedict as blasphemous, despite the museum\\'s explanation that it was a \"self-portrait illustrating human angst\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nChristopher Kippenberger\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nNew York Times obituary by Roberta Smith\\nHolland Cotter review of 2009 retrospective show at MOMA\\nSFMOMA Collection\\nPostmedia page\\nThe Saatchi Gallery - Martin Kippenberger, Gallery In London with images, information, text and biography about Martin Kippenberger\\nMartin Kippenberger on Artcyclopedia\\nTate Modern - Martin Kippenberger, retrospective 8 February 2006 – 14 May 2006\\nSkarstedt Gallery New York\\nCrucified frog controversy\\nGerman Crucified Frog Sculpture Angers Catholics in Italy\\nMartin Kippenberger: The Problem Perspective / Museum of Modern Art MoMA New York, 2009\\nMartin Kippenberger Fan Shop\\nErik Bakke review of 2009 retrospective at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\\nMuseo Picasso Malaga exhibition on Kippenberger\\nLa mirada paseante: Kippenberger.

       "  'Claes Oldenburg (January 28, 1929 – July 18, 2022) was a Swedish-born American sculptor best known for his public art installations, typically featuring large replicas of everyday objects. Another theme in his work is soft sculpture versions of everyday objects. Many of his works were made in collaboration with his wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in 2009; they had been married for 32 years. Oldenburg lived and worked in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nClaes Oldenburg was born on January 28, 1929, in Stockholm, the son of Gösta Oldenburg and his wife Sigrid Elisabeth née Lindforss. His father was then a Swedish diplomat stationed in New York and in 1936 was appointed consul general of Sweden to Chicago where Oldenburg grew up, attending the Latin School of Chicago. He studied literature and art history at Yale University from 1946 to 1950, then returned to Chicago where he took classes at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While further developing his craft, he worked as a reporter at the City News Bureau of Chicago. He also opened his own studio and, in 1953, became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1956, he moved to New York, and for a time worked in the library of the Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration, where he also took the opportunity to learn more, on his own, about the history of art.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nOldenburg\\'s first recorded sales of artworks were at the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago, where he sold 5 items for a total price of $25. He moved back to New York City in 1956. There he met a number of artists, including Jim Dine, Red Grooms, and Allan Kaprow, whose happenings incorporated theatrical aspects and provided an alternative to the abstract expressionism that had come to dominate much of the art scene. Oldenburg began toying with the idea of soft sculpture in 1957, when he completed a free-hanging piece made from a woman\\'s stocking stuffed with newspaper. (The piece was untitled when he made it but is now referred to as Sausage.)\\nBy 1960, Oldenburg had produced sculptures containing simply rendered figures, letters, and signs, inspired by the Lower East Side neighborhood where he lived, made out of materials such as cardboard, burlap, and newspapers; in 1961, he shifted his method, creating sculptures from chicken wire covered with plaster-soaked canvas and enamel paint, depicting everyday objects – articles of clothing and food items. Oldenburg\\'s first show which included three-dimensional works, in May 1959, was at the Judson Gallery, at Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square. During this time, artist Robert Beauchamp described Oldenburg as \"brilliant\", due to the reaction that the pop artist brought to a \"dull\" abstract expressionist period.\\nIn the 1960s, Oldenburg became associated with the pop art movement and created many so-called happenings, which were performance art related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was \"Ray Gun Theater\". The cast of colleagues who appeared in his performances included artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, Oyvind Fahlstrom and Richard Artschwager, art gallerist Annina Nosei, critic Barbara Rose, and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. His first wife (1960–1970) Patty Mucha (Patricia Muchinski), who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, KIDwas a constant performer in his happenings. His brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature,t with \"profound\" expressions or ideas. But Oldenburg\\'s spirited art found first a niche then a great popularity that endures to this day. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side to house \"The Store\", a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculhly in the form of consumer goods.\\nOldenburg moved to Los Angeles in 1963 \"because it was the most opposite thing to New York [he] could think of\". That same year, he conceived AUT OBO DYS, performed in the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in December 1963. In 1965, he turned his attention to drawings and projects for imaginary outdoor monuments. Initially these monuments took the form of small collages such as a crayon image of a fat, fuzzy teddy bear looming over the grassy fields of New York\\'s Central Park (1965) and Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London (1966). In 1967, New York city cultural adviser Sam Green realized Oldenburg\\'s first outdoor public monument; Placid Civic Monument took the form of a Conceptual performance/action behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, with a crew of gravediggers digging a 6-by-3-foot rectangular hole in the ground. In 1969, Oldenberg contributed a drawing to the Moon Museum. Geometric Mouse-Scale A, Black 1/6, also from 1969, was selected to be part of the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York.\\nMany of Oldenburg\\'s large-scale sculptures of mundane objects elicited ridicule before being accepted. For example, the 1969 Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks, was removed from its original place in Beinecke Plaza at Yale University, and \"circulated on a loan basis to other campuses\". English art critic Ellen H. Johnson says that with its \"bright color, contemporary form and material and its ignoble subject, it attacked the sterility and pretentiousness of the classicistic building behind it\". The artist \"pointed out it opposed levity to solemnity, color to colorlessness, metal to stone, simple to a sophisticated tradition. In theme, it is both phallic, life-engendering, and a bomb, the harbinger of death. Male in form, it is female in subject\". One of a number of  Oldenburg\\'s sculptures that possess interactive capabilities, it now resides in the Morse College courtyard. \\nFrom the early 1970s on, Oldenburg concentrated almost exclusively on public commissions. His first public work, Three-Way Plug came on commission from Oberlin College with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. His collaboration with Dutch/American writer and art historian Coosje van Bruggen dates from 1976. They were married in 1977. Oldenburg officially signed all the work he did from 1981 on with both his own name and van Bruggen\\'s. Their first collaboration came when Oldenburg was commissioned to rework Trowel I, a 1971 sculpture of an oversize garden tool, for the grounds of the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo in the Netherlands. \\nIn 1988, the two created the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. It remains a staple of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden as well as a classic image of the city. Typewriter Eraser, Scale X (1999) is in the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden. Another well known construction by the duo is the Free Stamp in downtown Cleveland.\\nIn addition to freestanding projects, they occasionally contributed to architectural projects, among them, two Los Angeles projects in collaboration with architect Frank Gehry: Toppling Ladder With Spilling Paint, which was installed at Loyola Law School in 1986, and the building-mounted sculpture Giant Binoculars, completed in Venice Beach in 1991. The couple\\'s collaboration with Gehry also involved a return to performance for Oldenburg when the trio presented Il Corso del Coltello, in Venice, Italy, in 1985; other characters were portrayed by Germano Celant and Pontus Hultén. \"Coltello\" is the source of Knife Ship, a large-scale sculpture that served as the central prop; it was later seen in Los Angeles in 1988 when Oldenburg, van Bruggen and Gehry presented Coltello Recalled: Reflections on a Performance at the Japanese American Cultural & Community Center and the exhibition Props, Costumes and Designs for the Performance \"Il Corso del Coltello\" at Margo Leavin Gallery. He collaborated with English director Gerald Fox in 1996 to make a documentary about himself in association with The South Bank Show which was broadcast on ITV.\\nThe city of Milan, Italy, commissioned the work known as Needle, Thread and Knot (Italian: Ago, filo e nodo) which was installed in 2000 in the Piazzale Cadorna. In 2001, Oldenburg and van Bruggen created Dropped Cone, a huge inverted ice cream cone, on top of a shopping center in Cologne, Germany. Installed at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2011, Paint Torch is a towering 53-foot-high (16 m) pop sculpture of a paintbrush, capped with bristles that are illuminated at night. The sculpture is installed at a daring 60-degree angle, as if in the act of painting. In 2018, The Maze was included in 1968: Sparta Dreaming Athens at Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nOldenburg\\'s first one-man show, in 1959 at the Judson Gallery in New York, had shown figurative drawings and papier-mâché sculptures. He was honored with a solo exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet (organized by Pontus Hultén), in 1966; the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1969; London\\'s Tate Gallery in 1970 (chronicled in a 1970 twin-projection documentary by James Scott called The Great Ice Cream Robbery); and with a retrospective organized by Germano Celant at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1995 (travelling to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Bonn; and Hayward Gallery, London). In 2002, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York held a retrospective of the drawings of Oldenburg and van Bruggen; the same year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York exhibited a selection of their sculptures on the roof of the museum. \\nOldenburg is represented by the Pace Gallery in New York and Margo Leavin Gallery in Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 1989, Oldenburg won the Wolf Prize in Arts. In 2000, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Oldenburg received honorary degrees from Oberlin College, Ohio, in 1970; Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois, in 1979; Bard College, New York, in 1995; and Royal College of Art, London, in 1996, as well as the following awards: Brandeis University Sculpture Award, 1971; Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, 1972; Art Institute of Chicago, First Prize Sculpture Award, 72nd American Exhibition, 1976; Medal, American Institute of Architects, 1977; Wilhelm-Lehmbruck Prize for Sculpture, Duisburg, Germany, 1981; Brandeis University Creative Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, The Jack I. and Lillian Poses Medal for Sculpture, 1993; Rolf Schock Foundation Prize, Stockholm, Sweden, 1995. He was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters from 1975 on and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1978.\\nOldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen together received honorary degrees from the California College of the Arts, San Francisco, California, in 1996; University of Teesside, Middlesbrough, England, in 1999; Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2005; the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan, in 2005, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, 2011. Awards for their collaboration include the Distinction in Sculpture, SculptureCenter, New York (1994); Nathaniel S. Saltonstall Award, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (1996); Partners in Education Award, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (2002); and Medal Award, School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2004).\\nIn her 16-minute, 16mm film Manhattan Mouse Museum (2011), artist Tacita Dean captured Oldenburg in his studio as he gently handles and dusts the small objects that line his bookshelves. The film is less about the artist\\'s iconography than the embedded intellectual process which allowed him to transform everyday objects into remarkable sculptural forms.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPatty Mucha, who was married to Claes Oldenburg from 1960 to 1970, first met him after moving to New York City in 1957 to become an artist. When Oldenburg was painting portraits, Mucha became one of his nude models before becoming his first wife. An Oldenburg drawing of Mucha titled Pat Reading in Bed, Lenox, 1959 is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. She was a collaborator in Oldenburg\\'s happenings by coming up with ideas together, making the costumes together, and was also a performer in the piece, along with collaborating on happenings, she also as well, sewed his famous floor hamburger, ice cream, and cake. Mucha was lead singer in the band The Druds who were a band of artists including Andy Warhol, LaMonte Young,  Lucas Samaras, and Walter DeMaria pre-velvet underground.\\nBetween 1969 and 1977, Oldenburg was in a relationship with the feminist artist and sculptor, Hannah Wilke, who died in 1993. They shared several studios and traveled together, and Wilke often photographed him.\\nOldenburg and his second wife, Coosje van Bruggen, met in 1970 when Oldenburg\\'s first major retrospective traveled to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where van Bruggen was a curator. The couple were married in 1977.\\nIn 1992, Oldenburg and van Bruggen acquired Château de la Borde, a small Loire Valley chateau, whose music room gave them the idea of making a domestically sized collection. Van Bruggen and Oldenburg renovated the house, decorating it with modernist pieces by among others Le Corbusier, Charles and Ray Eames, and Alvar Aalto, Frank Gehry, Eileen Gray. Van Bruggen died on January 10, 2009, from the effects of breast cancer.\\nOldenburg\\'s brother, art historian Richard E. Oldenburg, was director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, between 1972 and 1993, and later chairman of Sotheby\\'s America.\\nOn July 18, 2022, Oldenburg died at his home in Manhattan from complications of a fall, aged 93.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nOldenburg\\'s sculpture Typewriter Eraser (1976), the third piece from an edition of three, was sold for $2.2 million at Christie\\'s New York in 2009.\\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art currently houses thirty of Oldenburg\\'s works.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCupid\\'s Span, San Francisco\\n\\n\\n== General and cited references ==\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nClaes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen\\'s website\\nThe Pace Gallery\\nClaes Oldenburg at the Museum of Modern Art\\nPortraits of Claes Oldenburg at the National Portrait Gallery, London\\nOldenburg page at the Guggenheim Museum site\\nAn anthology of Oldenburg\\'s work, includes brief bio\\nNational Gallery of Art Claes Oldenburg: Making the Ordinary Extraordinary\\nPop Art Masters – Claes Oldenburg\\nBiography of Claes Oldenburg\\nClaes Oldenburg in the National Gallery of Australia\\'s Kenneth Tyler collection\\nAn editorial of Oldenburg\\'s work, highlighting five of his large-scale public sculptures',\n",
       "  'Matthew Barney (born March 25, 1967) is an American contemporary artist and film director who works in the fields of sculpture, film, photography and drawing. His works explore connections among geography, biology, geology and mythology as well as notable themes of sex, intercourse, and conflict. His early pieces were sculptural installations combined with performance and video. Between 1994 and 2002, he created The Cremaster Cycle, a series of five films described by Jonathan Jones in The Guardian as \"one of the most imaginative and brilliant achievements in the history of avant-garde cinema.\" He is also known for his projects Drawing Restraint 9 (2005), River of Fundament (2014) and Redoubt (2018).\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nMatthew Barney was born March 25, 1967, as the younger of two children in San Francisco, California, where he lived until he was 7. He lived in Boise, Idaho from 1973 to 1985, where his father got a job administering a catering service at Boise State University and where he attended elementary, middle, and high school. His parents divorced and his mother, an abstract painter, moved to New York City, where he would frequently visit. It was there where he was first introduced to the art scene.\\nBarney was recruited by Yale University in 1985 to play football and planned to go into pre-med, but he also intended to study art. In 1989, he graduated from Yale. His earliest works, created at Yale, were staged at the university\\'s Payne Whitney Gymnasium. In the 1990s, Barney moved to New York, where he worked as a catalog model, a career that helped him finance his early work as an artist. In 2002, Barney had a daughter with his then partner, the singer Björk, with whom he lived in a penthouse co-op in Brooklyn Heights. By September 2013, Barney and Björk were no longer a couple; Björk chronicled the breakup in her 2015 album Vulnicura.\\nAs of 2014, Barney maintained a studio in Long Island City, Queens.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Drawing Restraint (1987–present) ===\\nThe Drawing Restraint series began in 1987 as a series of studio experiments, drawing upon an athletic model of development in which growth occurs only through restraint: the muscle encounters resistance, becomes engorged and is broken down, and in healing becomes stronger. In literally restraining the body while attempting to make a drawing, Drawing Restraint 1–6 (1987–89) were documentations made using video and photography. Drawing Restraint 7 marks the influx of narrative and characterization, resulting in a three channel video and a series of drawings and photographs, for which Barney was awarded the Aperto Prize in the 1993 Venice Biennale.\\nA series of ten vitrines containing drawings, Drawing Restraint 8 was included in the 2003 Venice Biennale and prefigured the narrative development for Drawing Restraint 9 (2005). A major project consisting of a feature-length film and soundtrack composed by Björk, large-scale sculptures, photographs and drawings, Drawing Restraint 9 was built upon themes such as the Shinto religion, the tea ceremony, the history of whaling, and the supplantation of blubber with refined petroleum for oil. A full-scale survey of Barney\\'s work through Drawing Restraint 9 was held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2006 and included over 150 objects of varying media. Drawing Restraint 10 – 16 (2005–07) are site-specific performances that recall the earlier Yale pieces.\\nDrawing Restraint 17 and 18 were performed at the Schaulager in Basel in 2010 in conjunction with the exhibition \"Prayer Sheet with the Wound and the Nail,\" a survey of the Drawing Restraint series through Drawing Restraint 18.\\nDrawing Restraint 19 employs a skateboard as a drawing tool. A block of graphite is mounted beneath the skateboard deck on the front end of the board. A skater performs a nose manual (a wheelie on the nose of the board, leaning in the direction of movement) across a smooth surface, tipping the nose of the board forward and leaving behind a drawn graphite line. The piece was part of a benefit art show and auction titled \"Good Wood\", raising awareness and funds for Power House Productions\\' Ride It Sculpture Park in Detroit, Michigan. The riding was performed on site by skateboarder Lance Mountain, documented by photographer Joe Brook and published by Juxtapoz Magazine in their February 2013 issue. The board was purchased by People Skate and Snowboard and it is displayed at their only location in Keego Harbor, Michigan.\\n\\n\\n=== The Cremaster Cycle (1994–2002) ===\\n\\nMatthew Barney\\'s epic Cremaster cycle (1994–2002) is a self-enclosed aesthetic system consisting of five feature-length films that explore processes of creation. The cycle unfolds not just cinematically, but also through the photographs, drawings, sculptures, and installations the artist produces in conjunction with each episode. Its conceptual departure point is the male cremaster muscle, which controls testicular contractions in response to external stimuli. Barney\\'s long-time collaborator Jonathan Bepler composed and arranged the films’ soundtracks.\\nThe project is rife with anatomical allusions to the position of the reproductive organs during the embryonic process of sexual differentiation: Cremaster 1 represents the most \"ascended\" or undifferentiated state, Cremaster 5 the most \"descended\" or differentiated. The cycle repeatedly returns to those moments during early sexual development in which the outcome of the process is still unknown. In Barney\\'s metaphoric universe, these moments represent a condition of pure potentiality. As the cycle evolved over eight years, Barney looked beyond biology as a way to explore the creation of form, employing narrative models from other realms, such as biography, mythology, and geology. The photographs, drawings, and sculptures radiate outward from the narrative core of each film installment. Barney\\'s photographs—framed in plastic and often arranged in diptychs and triptychs that distill moments from the plot—often emulate classical portraiture. His graphite and petroleum jelly drawings represent key aspects of the project\\'s conceptual framework.\\n\\n\\n=== River of Fundament (2006–2014) ===\\n\\nRiver of Fundament takes the form of a three-act opera and is loosely based on Norman Mailer’s novel Ancient Evenings. In collaboration with composer Jonathan Bepler, Barney combines traditional modes of narrative cinema with filmed elements of performance, sculpture, and opera, reconstructing Mailer’s hypersexual story of Egyptian gods and the seven stages of reincarnation, alongside the rise and fall of the American car industry.\\nBarney replaced the human body with the body of the 1967 Chrysler Imperial that was the central motif from his earlier film Cremaster 3. The film’s central scene is an abstraction of Mailer’s wake, set in a replica of the late author’s apartment in Brooklyn Heights and featuring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Paul Giamatti, Elaine Stritch, Ellen Burstyn, Peter Donald Badalamenti II, Joan La Barbara, and jazz percussionist Milford Graves.\\n\\n\\n=== Redoubt (2018–2021) ===\\nBarney began producing a new two-hour film, Redoubt, in 2017, which premiered in March 2019. It is set in the Sawtooth Range of Idaho, United States, and uses multiple layers of myths, including the myth of Diana and Actaeon, as well as references to the controversial reintroduction of wolves into the Sawtooth Mountains and metallurgy, to discuss \"humanity\\'s place in the natural world\". The Yale University Art Gallery debuted Redoubt on March 1, 2019, alongside an exhibition of large bronze and brass sculptures and electroplated engravings inspired by the film. The show traveled afterward to UCCA Beijing (2019-2020), then Hayward Gallery in London (2020- 2021).\\n\\n\\n=== Performance ===\\nBarney has explored live performance before an audience. The pieces REN and Guardian of the Veil revisit the language of the Cremaster Cycle, via a ritualistic exploration of Egyptian symbolism inspired by Norman Mailer\\'s novel Ancient Evenings. Guardian of the Veil took place on July 12, 2007, at the Manchester International Festival in England. REN took place on May 18, 2008, in Los Angeles. His October 2, 2010 performance, KHU, the second part in his seven-part performance series in collaboration with Jonathan Bepler inspired by Ancient Evenings, took place in Detroit.\\nIn June 2009, a collaboration between Barney and Elizabeth Peyton, titled Blood of Two, was performed for the opening of the Deste Foundation\\'s exhibition space, the Slaughterhouse, located on the Greek island Hydra. The two-hour performance involved divers retrieving from a nearby cove a vitrine containing drawings which had been submerged for months. A funeral-like procession of fishermen carried the case up a winding set of stairs. At one point, a dead shark was laid on the case, and the fishermen proceeded to the gallery space, carrying the case and shark, accompanied by the onlookers and a herd of goats. At the Slaughterhouse, the case was opened, water poured out, and the drawings revealed. The shark was eventually cooked and fed to the guests.\\n\\n\\n=== Public projects ===\\nIn June 2017, Barney, local art curator Brandon Stosuy, and other artists installed Remains Board on his studio in Long Island City. The board is a large seven-segment digital clock, visible from the United Nations and midtown Manhattan, counting down the days, hours, and minutes remaining in the U.S. president Donald Trump\\'s first term. The Remains Board was initially illuminated during a durational performance of physical comedy by Josh Fadem. On inauguration day in 2021, at 12:00 p.m., Haela Hunt-Hendrix of Liturgy performed a guitar solo beneath the Remains Board as the clock began to approach 00:00:00.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nFollowing his inclusion in two group shows at Althea Viafora gallery in New York in 1990, Barney\\'s solo debut in 1991 at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery was hailed by The New York Times as \"an extraordinary first show\". That same year, at the age of twenty-four, he had a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, organized a solo exhibition of his work that toured Europe throughout 1995 and 1996. Barney was subsequently included in many international exhibitions, such as documenta 9 in Kassel (1992); the 1993 and 1995 Biennial exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Aperto ’93 at the 48th Venice Biennale, for which he was awarded the Europa 2000 Prize. For the season 2000/2001 in the Vienna State Opera, Barney designed a large scale picture (176 sqm) as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\\n\"Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle\", an exhibition of artwork from the entire cycle organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, premiered at the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, in June 2002 and subsequently traveled to the Musée d\\'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. A large-scale exhibition of the entire “Drawing Restraint” series was organized by the 21st Century Museum for Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, in 2005 and traveled to Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Serpentine Gallery, London; and Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna. Barney has also had major solo exhibitions organized by Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo (2003), Living Art Museum in Reykjavik (2003), Sammlung Goetz in Munich (2007), and Fondazione Merz in Turin (2008). His work has been included in major group exhibitions including \"Moving Pictures\" at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and Guggenheim Bilbao (2002), Venice Biennale (2003), \"Quartet: Barney, Gober, Levine, Walker\" at Walker Art Center in Minneapolis (2005), Biennial of Moving Images at Centre pour l’Image Contemporaine in Paris (2005), and \"All in the Present Must Be Transformed: Matthew Barney and Joseph Beuys\" at Deutsche Guggenheim in Berlin (2006).\\nIn 2013, the Morgan Library & Museum mounted “Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney”, the first museum retrospective devoted to the artist\\'s drawings, later traveling to the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. In 2014, Barney exhibited \"River of Fundament\" at Haus der Kunst, Munich. The exhibition later traveled to the Museum of Old and New Art, Hobart, Tasmania and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. \"River of Fundament\"  was considered the largest filmic project since the Cremaster Cycle and first major museum solo exhibition in Los Angeles. In 2019, the Yale University Art Gallery exhibited \"Matthew Barney: Redoubt,\" the first solo museum exhibition in the U.S. since the presentation of \"River of Fundament\" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2015–16.\\n\\n\\n== Critical analysis ==\\nBarney\\'s work has provoked strong critical reaction, both positive and negative. Barney\\'s work has been compared to performance artists Chris Burden and Vito Acconci, and some critics have argued that Barney\\'s art is simultaneously a critique and a celebration of commercialism and blockbuster filmmaking. Commenting on the Cremaster series\\' enigmatic nature, Alexandra Keller and Frazer Ward write:\\n\\n\"Rather than reading Cremaster, we are encouraged to consume it as high-end eye candy, whose symbolic system is available to us but hardly necessary to our pleasure: meaning, that is, is no longer a necessary component to art production or reception. Left to its own devices-and it is all devices, Cremaster places us in a framework of mutually assured consumption, consuming us as we consume it.\"\\nThe philosopher Arthur C. Danto, well known for his work on aesthetics, has praised Barney\\'s work, noting the importance of Barney\\'s use of sign systems such as Masonic symbology.\\nOthers have asserted Barney\\'s works are contemporary expressions of surrealism. In the words of Chris Chang, Barney\\'s Cremaster films, though \"completely arcane, hermetic and solipsistic ... nevertheless periodically provide some of the most enigmatically beautiful experimental film imagery you\\'ll ever see.\"\\n\"Is Barney\\'s work a new beginning for a new century?\", asks Richard Lacayo, writing in Time. \"It feels more like a very energetic longing for a beginning, in which all kinds of imagery have been put to the service of one man\\'s intricate fantasy of return to the womb. Something lovely and exasperating is forever in formation there. Will he ever give birth?\"\\n\"Barney is the real thing. When he brings his boundless imagination to a subject he goes down to its depths to create images and implant ideas that stay in your mind for ever\" writes art historian Richard Dorment in The Daily Telegraph.\\nKanye West also admires Barney\\'s work and credited him as an influence on the music video for West\\'s song \"Famous\".\\n\\n\\n== Awards and prizes ==\\nEuropa 2000 Prize, Aperto \\'93, 45th Venice Biennale, 1993.\\nHugo Boss Prize, Guggenheim Museum, 1996.\\nJames D.

       "  'Pierre Huyghe (born 11 September 1962) is a French contemporary artist, who works in a variety of media from films and sculptures to public interventions and living systems. He lives and works in Paris and New York. \\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nPierre Huyghe (pronounced hweeg) was born in Paris in 1962. He studied at the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs in Paris, and graduated in 1985.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHuyghe participated in the Okayama Summit in 2016, and was the event\\'s artistic director in 2019. In an interview in Ocula Magazine with Stephanie Bailey, Huyghe explained that he chose \\'artists who construct worlds that have the capacity to endlessly change, rather than as makers of things\\' — a quality that translates to his own practice.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nHuyghe has received a number of awards, including the Nasher Prize (2017), Kurt Schwitters Prize (2015); Roswitha Haftmann Award (2013), the Smithsonian Museum’s Contemporary Artist Award (2010), the Hugo Boss Prize from the Guggenheim Museum (2002), and a DAAD in Berlin (1999–2000). In 2024, Huyghe was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix Artistique by the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca.\\n\\n\\n== Work and themes ==\\nHuyghe has been working with time-based situations and site-specific installations since the early 1990s. His works consist of such diverse forms as objects, films, photographs, drawings, music, fictional characters, and full-fledged ecosystems, in effect treating exhibition and its ritual as an object in itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Role playing ===\\nIn Blanche-Neige, (1997), Huyghe revealed the face and story of Lucie Dolène, the French voiceover artist whom Walt Disney hired to do the French language version of Snow White. When Disney subsequently reissued the film and used Dolmen\\'s voice without her permission, she sued the company for the right to own her own voice. Huyghe\\'s film is a simply edited headshot of Dolène recounting her experience in her unmistakable (to French ears) voice. Blanche-Neige was a more pointed followup to Dubbing, (1996), in which Huyghe screens Tobe Hooper\\'s film Poltergeist but focuses his camera on the fifteen actors who have been hired to do the French voiceovers rather than the projection of the film itself, which is only visible to the actors. In 1999, Huyghe and fellow French artist Philippe Parreno turned this idea of the subjective performance of language into the body of a fictional character by purchasing the rights to a manga figure whom they dubbed \"Annlee\". They then invited other artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pierre Joseph, Mélik Ohanian, Joe Scanlan, and Rirkrit Tiravanija to produce various works utilizing the character Annlee, the sum of which became the traveling group exhibition No Ghost Just A Shell. After several exhibitions, they transferred the character\\'s copyright to the Annlee Association—a legal entity owned by Annlee, thus ensuring her simultaneous freedom and death.\\n\\n\\n=== Fiction, memory, and place ===\\nHuyghe\\'s two-channel video The Third Memory (1999), commissioned by The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and later exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, takes as its starting point Sidney Lumet\\'s 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino in the role of the bank robber John Wojtowicz. Huyghe\\'s video reconstructs the set of Lumet\\'s film, but he allows Wojtowicz himself, now a few dozen years older and out of jail, to tell the story of the robbery. Huyghe juxtaposes images from the reconstruction with footage from Dog Day Afternoon, demonstrating that Wojtowicz\\'s memory has been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. Streamside Day Follies (2003) was commissioned by the DIA Art Foundation, New York, and involved the integrated relationship between three locales: a fictionalized community in the Hudson Valley that is launching an equally fictional neighborhood festival; a film verité that captures the proceedings of the fledgling festival; and DIA\\'s former Manhattan exhibition space. The exhibition entailed the regular creation of a fourth space in which the fictional community, the film, and the gallery would converge. Huyghe accomplished this by designing four walls suspended from motorized tracks that were programmed to intermittently organized themselves into a darkened enclosure in which the Streamside Day Follies film would screen. When the film was finished, the walls would disperse. A Journey that Wasn\\'t (2005) was commissioned by the Public Art Fund and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and entailed similar intersections of a fictional place, a film, and live convergence. As a film work, A Journey that Wasn\\'t juxtaposes a sailing expedition from Tierra del Fuego in search of an uncharted island off the coast of Antarctica, with the recording (and re-recording) of its symphonic score at the Wollman ice rink in Central Park. The symphonic score was composed by Joshua Cody and featured guitar soloist Elliott Sharp.\\nThe Host and the Cloud (2010) is a feature-length film that was shot entirely within the dormant building that had housed the National Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions, Paris. The rambling, melancholy, somewhat sci-fi narrative is structured around the celebrations of Halloween, Valentine\\'s Day, and May Day. The film\\'s premier at Marian Goodman Gallery, New York, was accompanied by several of Huyghe\\'s Zoodram sculptures, elaborate aquariums featuring exotic sea creatures that are not unlike the captive human ecosystem depicted in The Host and the Cloud. For dOCUMENTA(13) (2012) Pierre Huyghe created Untilled (2011–2012), a compost site within a baroque garden, a non hierarchical association that included a sculpture of a reclining nude with a head obscured by a swarming beehive, aphrodisiac and psychotropic plants, a dog with a pink leg, and an uprooted oak tree from Joseph Beuys’ 7,000 Oaks, among other elements. Untilled was ranked third in The Guardian\\'s Best Art of the 21st Century list, with critic Adrian Searle calling it a \"wondrous work\" and \"an elegy for a dying world\".\\n\\n\\n=== Anthropomorphism ===\\nHuman Mask (2014) is a film set in post-disaster Fukushima that depicts the listless activity of a trained monkey-servant dressed in the mask of a young woman.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nStech, Fabian (2006).

       "  'Richard Prince (born 1949) is an American painter and photographer. In the mid-1970s, Prince made drawings and painterly collages that he has since disowned. His image, Untitled (Cowboy), a photographic reproduction of a photograph by Sam Abell and appropriated from a cigarette advertisement, was the first rephotograph to be sold for more than $1 million at auction at Christie\\'s New York in 2005. He is regarded as \"one of the most revered artists of his generation\" according to The New York Times. \\nStarting in 1977, Prince photographed four photographs which previously appeared in The New York Times. This process of rephotographing continued into 1983, when his work Spiritual America featured Garry Gross\\'s photo of Brooke Shields at the age of ten, standing in a bathtub, as an allusion to precocious sexuality and to the Alfred Stieglitz photograph by the same name.  His Jokes series (beginning 1986) concerns the sexual fantasies and sexual frustrations of white, middle-class America, using stand-up comedy and burlesque humor.\\nAfter living in New York City for 25 years, Prince moved to upstate New York. His mini-museum, Second House, purchased by the Guggenheim Museum, was struck by lightning and burned down shortly after the museum purchased the House (which Prince had created for himself), having only stood for six years, from 2001 to 2007. In June 2021, the painting Runaway Nurse from 2005 to 2006 fetched a record-breaking 93,986,000 HKD (US$12,121,000) at Sotheby\\'s in Hong Kong. Prince now lives and works in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nRichard Prince was born on the 6th of August 1949, in the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone, now part of the Republic of Panama. During an interview in 2000 with Julie L. Belcove, he responded to the question of why his parents were in the Zone, by saying \"they worked for the government.\" When asked further if his father was involved in the military, Prince responded, \"No, he just worked for the government.\" The Wall Street Journal later reported that Prince\\'s parents worked for the Office of Strategic Services in the Panama Canal before he was born. Prince later lived in the New England city of Braintree, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and Provincetown on Cape Cod. In 1973, he moved to New York and joined publishing company Time Inc. His job at the Time Inc. library involved providing the company\\'s various magazines with tear sheets of articles.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nPrince was first interested in the art of the American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock. \"I was very attracted to the idea of someone who was by themselves, fairly antisocial, kind of a loner, someone who was noncollaborative.\" Prince grew up during the height of Pollock\\'s career, making his work accessible. The 1956 Time magazine article dubbing Pollock \"Jack the Dripper\" made the thought of pursuing art as career possible. After finishing high school in 1967, Prince set off for Europe at age 18.\\nHe returned home and attended Nasson College in Maine, which he described as without grades or structure. From Maine he moved to Braintree, Massachusetts, and for a brief time lived in Provincetown. Ultimately he was drawn to New York City. Prince has said that his attraction to New York was instigated by the famous photograph of Franz Kline gazing out the window of his 14th Street studio. Prince described the picture as \"a man content to be alone, pursuing the outside world from the sanctum of his studio.\"\\nPrince\\'s first solo exhibition took place in June 1980 during a residency at the CEPA gallery in Buffalo, New York. His short book Menthol Wars was published as part of the residency. In 1981 Prince had his first West Coast solo exhibition at Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1985, he spent four months making art in a rented house in Venice, Los Angeles.\\nIn late 2007, Prince had a retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, a comprehensive show hung in chronological order along the upward spiraling walls. The show continued onto the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Maria Morris Hamburg, the curator of photography at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, asserted, \"He is absolutely essential to what\\'s going on today, he figured out before anyone else—and in a very precocious manner—how thoroughly pervasive the media is. It\\'s not just an aspect of our lives, but the dominant aspect of our lives.\"\\nPrince has built up a large collection of Beat books and papers. Prince owns several copies of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, including one inscribed to Kerouac\\'s mother, one famously read on The Steve Allen Show, the original proof copy of the book and an original galley, as well as the copy owned by Neal Cassady (the Dean Moriarty character in the book), with Cassady\\'s signature and marginal notes.\\nDescribing his career and methodology in a 2005 New York magazine interview, Prince said, \"It\\'s about knocking about in the studio and bumping into things.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Rephotography ===\\nRe-photography uses appropriation as its own focus: artists pull from the works of others and the worlds they depict to create their own work. Appropriation art became popular in the late 1970s. Other appropriation artists such as, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Vikky Alexander, Cindy Sherman, Barbara Kruger and Mike Bidlo also became prominent in the East Village in the 1980s. This grouping of artists became known as the \"Pictures Generation.\" All of these artists were greatly influenced by the work of John Baldessari and Robert Heinecken, both of whom have worked extensively with found or readymade print photography since the 1960s, Baldessari working mainly with Hollywood film stills and Heineken mainly with magazine advertisements and print pornography. Both artists taught at UCLA and the California Institute for the Arts in Southern California throughout the 1970s, when many of these artists attended school there.\\nDuring the early period of his career, Prince worked in Time magazine\\'s tear sheets department. At the end of each work day, he would be left with nothing but the torn out advertising images from the eight or so magazines owned by Time-Life. On the topic of found photographs, Prince said, \"Oceans without surfers, cowboys without Marlboros…Even though I’m aware of the classicism of the images. I seem to go after images that I don’t quite believe. And, I try to re-present them even more unbelievably.\"\\n\\nPrince had very little experience with photography, but he has said in interviews that all he needed was a subject, the medium would follow, whether it be paint and brush or camera and film. He compared his new method of searching out interesting advertisements to \"beachcombing.\" His first series during this time focused on models, living room furniture, watches, pens, and jewellery.  Pop culture became the focus of his work. Prince described his experience of appropriation thus: \"At first it was pretty reckless. Plagiarizing someone else’s photograph, making a new picture effortlessly. Making the exposure, looking through the lens and clicking, felt like an unwelling . . . a whole new history without the old one. It absolutely destroyed any associations I had experienced with putting things together. And of course the whole thing about the naturalness of the film’s ability to appropriate. I always thought it had a lot to do with having a chip on your shoulder.\"\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Patrick Cariou copyright infringement suit ===\\n\\nIn December 2008, photographer Patrick Cariou filed suit against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Lawrence Gagosian and Rizzoli International Publications in Federal district court for copyright infringement in work shown at Prince\\'s Canal Zone exhibit at the Gagosian gallery. Prince was charged with wrongfully appropriating 35 photographs made by Cariou. Several of the pieces were barely changed by Prince.  Prince also made 28 paintings that included images from Cariou\\'s Yes Rasta book. The book featured a series of photographs of Rastafarians that Cariou had taken in Jamaica.\\nOn March 18, 2011, US District Judge Deborah A. Batts ruled against Prince, Gagosian Gallery, Inc., and Lawrence Gagosian.  The court found that the use by Prince was not fair use (his primary defence), and Cariou\\'s issue of liability for copyright infringement was granted in its entirety.  The court cited much case law including the Rogers v. Koons case of 1992. On April 25, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Batts\\'s ruling, stating that Prince\\'s use of the photographs in 25 works was transformative and thus fair use. Five less transformative works were sent back to the lower court for review. The case was settled in 2014.\\n\\n\\n=== Appropriation of Emily Ratajkowski\\'s Image ===\\nIn 2014, Prince appropriated one of Emily Ratajkowski\\'s Instagram posts without her consent and included the image in his \"New Portraits\" exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in New York. Seven years later, Ratajkowski took a photograph of herself standing in front of the painting, and created a non-fungible token (NFT) from it. The NFT sold at auction at Christie\\'s for $175,000. \"I hope to symbolically set a precedent for women and ownership online, one that allows for women to have ongoing authority over their image and to receive rightful compensation for its usage and distribution,\" Ratajkowski wrote on Twitter. Ratajkowski describes the event in the popular essay for The Cut, titled \"Buying Myself Back\". The controversy raises questions about personality rights and who gets to benefit from the use of one\\'s image.\\n\\n\\n=== Eric McNatt and Donald Graham infringement suits ===\\nIn 2016, photographer Donald Graham sued Prince for violating the copyright on his 1998 photograph, Rastafarian Smoking a Joint by including the photograph in his \"New Portraits\" series. In May of 2023, a New York judge ruled that Prince\\'s artwork Untitled (Portrait of Rastajay92) was not \"transformative\" enough to shield Prince from litigation, and that Graham\\'s copyright infringement case can proceed to trial. Photographer Eric McNatt similarly sued Prince in 2016 for infringing on his copyright to his portrait of Kim Gordon, co-founder of the band Sonic Youth. On January 26 2024, the two linked cases were settled, with damages awarded to Graham and McNatt, but without any admission of infringement by Prince. [1]\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cowboys ===\\nPrince\\'s series known as the Untitled Cowboys, produced from 1980 to 1992, and ongoing, is his most famous group of rephotographs. Taken from Marlboro cigarette advertisements of the Marlboro Man, they represent an idealized figure of American masculinity. The Marlboro Man was the iconic equivalent of later brands like Ralph Lauren, which used the polo pony image to identify and associate its brand. \"Every week. I\\'d see one and be like, Oh that\\'s mine, Thank you,\" Prince stated in an interview.\\nPrince\\'s Cowboys displayed men in boots and ten-gallon hats, with horses, lassos, spurs and all the fixings that make up the stereotypical image of a cowboy. They were set in the Western U.S., in arid landscapes with stone outcrops flanked by cacti and tumbleweeds, with backdrops of sunsets. The advertisements were staged with the utmost attention to detail.\\nPrince\\'s rephotographs of the Marlboro Man advertisements attempt to question how original and realistic the commercial depiction of a \"macho man on the horse\" is. Prince described his process in a 2003 interview by Steve Lafreiniere in Artforum: \"I had limited technical skills regarding the camera. Actually I had no skills. I played the camera. I used a cheap commercial lab to blow up the pictures. I made editions of two. I never went into a darkroom.\"\\nWhile Prince re-contextualizes images by others to redefine them, he has also failed to acknowledge those preceding photographers whose work he appropriates. For the Untitled (Cowboy) Series, this includes Norm Clasen and a handful of others. Clasen has expressed being aggrieved over the failure to attribute his work saying: \"If you see somebody\\'s copied your work, there\\'s something deep down in you that says \"I\\'m the author of that.\"\\'\\nUntitled (Cowboy) has since been credited by Time Magazine as one of the \"Top 100 most influential images of all time.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Jokes, Gangs, and Hoods ===\\nPrince\\'s rephotographs led to his series known as the Gangs, which followed the same technique of appropriating images from magazines as the Cowboys did, but now the subjects moved from advertisements and mass media toward niches in American society.\\nPrince in this series paid homage to \"sex, drugs, and rock\\'n\\'roll\" in American niches, seen through magazines. He depicted the bizarre in subcultures such as the motorcycle-obsessed, hot rod enthusiasts, surfers, and heavy metal music fans. These Gangs are recognized in his series Girlfriends, featuring biker girls. A motorcycle magazine he used featured photographs of motorcyclists\\' girlfriends, were sprawled on their boyfriends\\' bikes. Prince\\'s Gangs works are single sheets of white paper covered with a grouping or \"ganging\" of 9×12, 35 mm photographs. Prince did not intend any distinct relationship between the \"ganged\" photographs. An example can be seen in such works as his 1984 Velvet Beach, twelve Ektacolor-printed photographs of massive waves, clearly from a surf magazine. Another example is his 1986 Live Free or Die, gathering nine images of loosely dressed women on motorcycles.\\nPrince\\'s made his first Joke painting circa 1985, in New York, when he was living in the back room of 303 Gallery located on Park Avenue South. The first joke represented was about psychiatrists, a subject he later worked with often. Prince described the discovery of the idea for the Joke Paintings beginning when he posted a small 11 × 14 inch handwritten joke on paper. He realized that if he had walked into a gallery and had seen it hanging from the wall, he would have been envious. Prince\\'s Jokes come in several forms. His first Jokes were hand written, taken from joke books. His jokes grew into more substantial works as he began to incorporate them with images, often pairing jokes with images that had no relevance with one another, creating an obscure relationship. An example of one of these peculiar combinations can be seen in his 1991 Good Revolution, which depicted black and white images of a male torso in boxing shorts set amongst doodles of a kitchen stove. These were set above the text \"Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman that will give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you\\'re in the wrong home, that\\'s what it means.\" Another one of Prince\\'s most well-known Joke paintings is an 80s-style red canvas painting he did in 2004 that says, \"Two psychiatrists, one says to the other: I was having lunch with my mother the other day and I made a Freudian slip. I meant to say, \\'Please pass the butter,\\' and instead it came out, \\'You fucking bitch, you ruined my life.\\'\"\\nIn the late 1980s, Prince, like his contemporaries Lorna Simpson and Barbara Kruger, as well as many of his Conceptual Art precursors, played with image and text in a strategy that was becoming increasingly popular. Prince put jokes among cartoons, often from The New Yorker. Prince described his early discovery of jokes and his sense of humor, as \"I never really started telling, I started telling them over. Back in 1985, in Venice, California, I was drawing my favorite cartoons in pencil on paper. After this I dropped the illustration or image part of the cartoon and concentrated on the punch line.\" Prince\\'s jokes were primarily satirical one-liners, poking fun at topics such as religion, the relationship between husband and wife, his relations with women. The jokes are simple, often relying on a punch line: \"I took my wife to a wife-swapping party, I had to throw in some cash\" or \"I never had a penny to my name, so I changed my name.\"\\nJokes became the complete subject of his prints, set atop monochromatic backgrounds red, orange, blue, yellow, etc. These works range in size from 56 × 48 inches as seen in his 1994 Untitled, to 112 × 203.5 inches, as seen in his 2000 work Nuts. His early jokes were modestly sized, but as they caught on he executed larger pieces. These Monochromatic Jokes question the importance of the unique, in high art. What is it that set these jokes apart from one another, the background color, the color of the text, the jokes themselves? Compared to other Appropriation Artists working in the same time period, Prince has a distinct quality between works and series. Works are distinguishable from one another or identifiable as a particular artist, but with Prince\\'s Monochromatic Jokes, we are presented with yellow text upon a blue background as in his 1989 Are You Kidding? Differing from Jeff Koons, for example, are not only technique and style, but also the significance given to making the artwork identifiable. In 1988 Koons was working with porcelain sculptures like his Michael Jackson and Bubbles and Pink Panther. These are two works produced in this year that are distinguishable. In the same year, 1988, are Prince\\'s Fireman and the Drunk and his Untitled (Joke), which raise the serious question of what sets these two works apart. In a 2000 interview with Julie L. Belcove, Prince called the joke paintings \"what I wanted to become known for.\" When asked to identify the artistic genre of his Jokes, Prince responded, \"the Joke paintings are abstract. Especially in Europe, if you can\\'t speak English.\"\\nWhile developing his Gang photographs and Joke paintings Prince was also making sculptural facsimiles of muscle car hoods that merged muscle car culture as a particularly American state of mind. Prince ordered classic vehicle car hoods from within custom car restoration networks and then used the hoods to cast Fiberglas molds which he washed in different colors.\\n\\n\\n=== Celebrities ===\\nCelebrities is a series that plays with the American obsession with movie stars. Following Warhol\\'s lead, Prince would search out actors\\' headshots, promotional photographs which frequently lack copyright protection. Prince signed them himself, using the actor\\'s name.\\n\\n\\n=== Check Paintings ===\\nThe Check Paintings series is like the Celebrities. It was made possible by Prince\\'s own interest in collecting. Prince began to seek out canceled checks from famous figures in history ranging from Jack Kerouac to Andy Warhol. He put these checks onto paint-covered canvases and often paired them with images of the individual they once belonged to.\\n\\n\\n=== Nurse Paintings ===\\nThe Nurse Paintings are a series inspired by the covers and titles of inexpensive novels that were commonly sold at newspaper stands and delis (pulp romance novels). Prince scanned the covers of the books on his computer and used inkjet printing to transfer the images to canvas, and then personalized the pieces with acrylic paint. They debuted in 2003 at Barbara Gladstone Galleries, who along with Larry Gagosian, represents Prince. They received mixed responses, not all selling at the asking prices of $50,000 to $60,000. Titles include Surfer Nurse, Naughty Nurse, Millionaire Nurse, and Dude Ranch Nurse, the books from which they were copied. Prince said, \"The problem with art is, it\\'s not like the game of golf, where you put the ball in the hole or you don\\'t put the ball in the hole. There\\'s no umpire. There\\'s no judge. There are no rules. It\\'s one of the problems, but it\\'s also one of the great things about art: it becomes a question of what lasts.\" The Sonic Youth album Sonic Nurse used Nurse paintings, and included a song called \"Dude Ranch Nurse\". \\nIn the series of paintings, the nurses all wear caps and their mouths are covered by surgical masks, although in some of the paintings the red lips bleed through the masks. The final presentations preserve the title and nurse image from each of the book covers, though almost all else is obscured. Titles include A Nurse Involved, Aloha Nurse, Bachelor Nurse, Danger Nurse at Work, Debutant Nurse, and Doctor\\'s Nurse.\\nPrince\\'s Nurse paintings have become by far his most expensive series, accounting for his 17 biggest results at auction as of September 2021.\\n\\n\\n=== Later works ===\\nPrince\\'s series of paintings from 2007 on appear to be a throwback to more traditional genres of figurative art, and a departure from the pulpy and kitschy content of the Nurse and Jokes series. They are pornographic ink-jet prints overlaid with acrylic paint in a style trying to imitate Willem de Kooning. Prince makes the most direct treatment to the faces, hands and feet, which are bulged and distorted. These works lack the obvious linguistic re-contextualizing of the Jokes series, opting instead for a purely visual idiom.\\nIn 2007, Prince collaborated with the fashion designer Marc Jacobs on his Spring 2008 collection for the French label Louis Vuitton.\\nAn untitled work consists of the body of a 1970 Dodge Challenger and high-performance parts such as a 660 hp Hemi engine, custom interior, black wheel wells, 14-inch tires in the front and 16 inch in the back, a pale orange paint job with a flat black T/A hood, as well as various decals and emblems. Another car sculpture, called American Prayer, is a 1968 Dodge Charger that has been completely emptied of any engine parts and interiors and is stripped of any paint and then powder coated. In place of the engine block there is a cement block.\\nIn Untitled (Covering Pollock), a series of 27 works made between 2009 and 2011, Prince printed black-and-white photos of Jackson Pollock taken by Hans Namuth on canvas and pasted grids of photographs showing Sid Vicious, Kate Moss, Stephanie Seymour and pornographic imagery on top. Prince adds his own Pollock-style gestures in paint around the grids.\\nIn 2014, Prince continued his appropriation theme with an exhibit of 38 portraits at the Gagosian gallery in New York City, entitled \"New Portraits.\" Each image was taken from his Instagram feed and included topless images of models, artists, and celebrities. Underneath the images, Prince provided comments like, \"Don\\'t du anything.

       "  'David Salle (born September 28, 1952; last name pronounced \"Sally\") is an American Postmodern painter, printmaker, photographer, and stage designer. Salle was born in Norman, Oklahoma, and lives and works in East Hampton, New York. He earned a BFA and MFA from the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California, where he studied with John Baldessari. Salle’s work first came to public attention in New York City in the early 1980s.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nDavid Salle was born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents on September 28, 1952, in Norman, Oklahoma, but grew up in Wichita, Kansas. He developed an interest in art at a very young age, spending his childhood and teenage years in art classes provided by a local art organization. At an early age he began taking life-drawing classes at the Wichita Art Association. During high school, he attended outside art classes three days a week.\\nAfter graduating from high school, Salle attended the California Institute of the Arts. There he trained and studied under John Baldessari, whom he credits for showing him a path to his artistry. Salle earned his BFA in three years, then received his MFA in two.\\nAfter graduating, Salle relocated to New York City, where he worked for Vito Acconci. During this time, he established a working partnership with Mary Boone. Around the same time, Salle was hired by the American Ballet Theatre to design set and costumes for dancer and choreographer Karole Armitage.\\nIn 1995, Salle made his Hollywood directorial debut with Search and Destroy, starring Christopher Walken and Griffin Dunne and produced by Martin Scorsese. The film met with very negative reactions.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nSalle\\'s paintings and prints consist of what appear to be randomly juxtaposed and multilayered images, or images placed on top of one other with deliberately illogical techniques, in which he combines original and appropriated imagery. Imagery he uses includes items from popular culture, such as Donald Duck, and pieces from art history, such as parts from a Caravaggio painting. \\nSalle has worked with different media and processes. Many of his works consist of juxtaposed images, where he takes abstraction and the human figure. He manipulates images by combining a variety of different styles, recognizable imagery, and textures. Exhibitions of his work have taken place at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Castello di Rivoli (Torino, Italy), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and the Kestnergesellschaft Museum in Hannover, Germany. Salle\\'s work was also featured in The Pictures Generation, an exhibition curated by Douglas Eklund at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His work was shown among a number of other contemporary artists including Richard Prince, Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, Nancy Dwyer, Robert Longo, Thomas Lawson, Charles Clough, and Michael Zwack.\\nSalle\\'s process typically starts with photographs he takes for reference, such as hired models. This was both groundbreaking and controversial at the time, primarily because the combination of these two art forms was not common practice. During this period, painters and photographers were often debating which form had more merit, or whether they had merit at all. Though his collection of photographs is considered art itself, Salle has said he would paint his final images because it took images from the real world and placed them in the world and context of painting. \\nAccording to Salle, his intention was to eliminate any narrative from his work, though one might attempt to decipher a story from the imagery. His decision-making process begins with one image he is attracted to, to which he continues to add pieces from specific images he acquired until the painting feels complete. Though Salle\\'s works do not contain a narrative, they do not lack meaning or relation. He has said that his choices of image are far from random, and that the pieces he chooses are cross-referenced with one another in complex ways. He believes this to be his form of originality in pieces that he appropriates.\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21, Salle has painted a series of works called Tree of Life which reference Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, and The New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno (1904-1968). The canvases alternate between a black and white and polychrome palette.\\nSalle has also done set and costume design and directed films. In 1986 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Theater Design, and directed the feature film Search and Destroy. He is a longtime collaborator with the choreographer Karole Armitage, designing sets and costumes for her ballets.\\nSalle has explored the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in his art. In 2023, he collaborated with computer scientists to create a program capable of generating images reflective of his style. The program was trained on a dataset composed of Salle’s paintings and refined based on his input. Salle has described the generative AI as useful because he can conceptualize variations of artwork when brainstorming ideas for new paintings. When asked about the potential of AI superseding him someday, Salle acknowledged the large role that AI may play in the future of art.\\n\\n\\n== Written works ==\\nSalle is also a prolific writer on art. His essays and reviews have appeared in Artforum, Art in America, Modern Painters, The Paris Review, Interview, and numerous exhibition catalogs and anthologies. He was a regular contributor to Town & Country magazine. His collection of critical essays, How to See, was published by W. W. Norton in 2016. Salle worked closely with fellow contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein, and John Baldessari in creating this collection. According to Dwight Garner:\\n\\nMr. Salle’s mission in How to See is to seize art back from the sort of critics who treat each painting “as a position paper, with the artist cast as a kind of philosopher manqué.” Mr. Salle is more interested in talking about nuts and bolts, about what makes contemporary paintings tick.\\nSalle\\'s writing is much like his artistic style, witty and intriguing. He believes the jargon associated with art history can and should be simplified so that those who are interested but lack fine art schooling can still learn about and appreciate art.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism and praise ==\\nThough Salle insists that his works are not a random assortment of images layered onto one another, critics were difficult to convince. Some common critiques are that his paintings are incoherent and the images he chooses arbitrary and unrelated to one another. The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto wrote that Salle\\'s paintings convey a \"sense of purposiveness with no specific purpose.\" Critic Robert Storr was fascinated by the work\\'s \"graphic double-exposure\" and \"kaleidoscopic effect,\" as well as its infinite meanings and interpretations.\\nAnother point of contention was Salle\\'s use of pornographic images of women, which some critics found a form of voyeurism or downright provocation, particularly to the feminist movement. Mira Schor, a feminist artist and writer, wrote that his portrayals of women seem \"to be a continuation of a male conversation which is centuries old, to which women are irrelevant except as depersonalized projections of man\\'s fears and fantasies.\" Salle, as well as many critics, says that the images, though sexually explicit, are not \"particularly erotic\" because they are faded and blurred, distancing them from reality.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\nSalle\\'s work is in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website',\n",
       "  'Keith Tyson (born Keith Thomas Bower, 23 August 1969) is an English artist. In 2002, he was the winner of the Turner Prize. Tyson works in a wide range of media, including painting, drawing and installation.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBower moved to Dalton-in-Furness when he was four, adopting his stepfather\\'s surname Tyson. He showed an interest in and talent for art at an early age, having been inspired by his \"very creative and enthusiastic\" primary school art teacher.  However he left school and took employment as a fitter and turner with VSEL (Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd., now BAE Systems) in Barrow-in-Furness.\\nIn 1989, he began an art foundation course at the Carlisle College of Art, and the following year he moved south to take up a place on  experimental Alternative Practice degree at The Faculty of Arts and Architecture, University of Brighton (1990–93).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nDuring the 1990s, Tyson\\'s practice was dominated by the Artmachine, through which Tyson explored his ongoing interest in randomness, causality, and the question of how things come into being. The Artmachine was a method Tyson developed which used a combination of computer programmes, flow charts and books in order to generate chance combinations of words and ideas, which were then realised in practice as artworks in a wide range of media.\\nThe results of the Artmachine became the basis of Tyson\\'s earliest exhibited artworks; The Artmachine Iterations, as these works became known, established Tyson\\'s reputation in the UK and internationally as an original artist and thinker, and by 1999 he had mounted solo exhibitions in London, New York, Paris and Zürich, as well as contributed to group shows throughout Europe, North America and Australia.\\nFrom 1999, Tyson\\'s interests practice turned from the Artmachine towards an artistic approach which explored the same thematic terrain, but this time directly by his own hand. The first such body of work was entitled Drawing and Thinking. Many of these works were installed in the international exhibition in the 2001 Venice Biennale\\nIn 2002, Tyson mounted Supercollider at South London Gallery and then the Kunsthalle Zürich in Switzerland. The name of the exhibition, derived from the popular name for the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, indicated the significance of scientific ways of seeing and thinking about the world to Tyson\\'s art at this time.\\nIn December 2002, Tyson was awarded the British visual arts award, the Turner Prize. The other shortlisted artists that year were Fiona Banner, Liam Gillick and Catherine Yass. The Turner Prize was notorious that year not so much for the controversial nature of the work of the shortlisted artists as in previous years, but because of the comments of then Culture Minister Kim Howells. His comments that the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain consisted of \"cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit\" were greeted with both approval and criticism in the media.\\n\\nIn 2005,  The following year, Tyson first exhibited his most monumental and ambitious work to date, Large Field Array, in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, which then travelled to the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in the Netherlands and The Pace Gallery in New York.  In 2009 Tyson\\'s work was shown at the Hayward Gallery as part of the group exhibition \"Walking in My Mind\".\\n\\n\\n== Artworks ==\\n\\n\\n=== The Artmachine Iterations ===\\nOnly a fraction of the instructions issued from the Artmachine were realised as artworks (the Artmachine generated around 12,000 proposals which are still unmade), but many of the playful and inventive mixed media works that were created include a twenty-four foot painting made from bathroom sealant, and a painting using toothpaste and music CDs.\\n\\n\\n=== Large Field Array ===\\nDescribed by Walter Robinson as \"nothing less than a complete Pop cosmology\",  Large Field Array comprises 300 modular units, most formed from into implied 2-foot cubes; the cubes are arranged into a grid occupying both the floor and walls of a gallery when installed. Each highly crafted cubic sculpture represents a unique yet highly recognizable feature of the world, from popular culture to natural history. Sculptures as diverse as a representation of American Donald Trump’s wedding cake, a chimney with a bird on top of it with a satellite dish, and a chair made of skeletons, were all constructed and arranged. The installation invited the viewer/participant to negotiate his or her own path through a seemingly random assortment of images and ideas, echoing the mental processes which create free associations between disparate phenomena which so fascinate Tyson.\\n\\n\\n=== The Nature Paintings (2005–2008) ===\\nA mixture of paints, pigments and chemicals are allowed to interact in specific ways upon an acid primed aluminium panel. The combined processes of gravity, chemical reaction, temperature, hydrophobia and evaporation simultaneously conspire to create surfaces reminiscent of a wide range of natural forms and landscapes. In this respect, the paintings seem to be depict nature, but they are also created by nature as well.\\n\\n\\n=== Studio Wall Drawings (1997–present) ===\\nCollectively these works on paper represent Tyson’s sketchbook or journal. Each ‘Wall Drawing’ is made on a sheet of paper measuring 158 cm x 126 cm, the same dimensions as a small wall in Tyson\\'s original studio where he used to draw-up notes. Over the years these sheets have recorded his ideas, emotional tone and mood, visits people made to the studio, world events and even economic fluctuations. They are often exhibited in large non-chronological grids to form solid walls of diverse images, and text.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nSolo and group exhibition catalogues\\nCloud Choreography and Other Emergent Systems, Parasol Unit foundation for contemporary art, London, 2009\\nMartian Museum of Terrestrial Art, Barbican Art Gallery, London, 2008\\nKeith Tyson, Studio Wall Drawings 1997–2007, Haunch of Venison, London, 2007\\nKeith Tyson, Large Field Array, Louisiana Museum, Denmark, 2006\\nHow to Improve the World: 60 Years of British Art, Hayward Gallery, London, 2006\\nKeith Tyson, Geno Pheno, PaceWildenstein, New York/Haunch of Venison, London, 2005\\nKeith Tyson, History Paintings, 2005\\nDionysiac, Centre Pompidou, Paris, 2005\\nHead to Hand, Drawings by Keith Tyson, Thea Westreich & Ethan Wagner, New York, 2002\\nKeith Tyson, Kunsthalle Zürich, Switzerland, 2002\\nSupercollider, South London Gallery, London, 2002\\nTurner Prize Exhibition, Tate Britain, London, 2002\\nPublic Affairs, Kunsthaus Zürich, Switzerland, 2002\\nCentury City: Art and Culture in the Modern Metropolis, Tate Modern, London, 2000\\nOver the Edges, SMAK-Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Gent, 2000\\nDream Machines, Hayward Gallery, London, 2000\\nSecondary works\\nMark Rappolt, \\'Life, the Universe and Everything\\', Art Review, February 2007\\nRachel Withers, ‘Keith Tyson’, Artforum, March 2005\\nMarcus Verhagen, \\'Keith Tyson\\', Art Monthly, December 2004 - January 2005\\nMichael Archer, \\'Primordial Soups\\', Parkett 71, 2004\\nEthan Wagner and Keith Tyson, \\'A Conversation\\', Parkett 71, 2004\\nHans Rudolph Reust, \\'Fabulous Art\\', Parkett 71, 2004\\nTony Barrell, ‘Rising to the Equation’, Sunday Times Magazine, 30 November 2003 [1]\\nVirginia Button, The Turner Prize: Twenty Years, Tate Publishing, 2003\\nMatthew Collings, Art Crazy Nation: The Post Blimey Art World, 21 Publishing Ltd, 2001\\nLouisa Buck, Moving Targets 2, A Users Guide to British Art Now, Tate Publishing, London, 2000\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nKeith Tyson official website\\nKeith Tyson at The Pace Gallery\\nKeith Tyson at Galerie Vallois Paris\\nKeith Tyson at ARNDT Berlin\\nKeith Tyson interview\\nKeith Tyson at Tullie House',\n",
       "  'John Anthony Baldessari (June 17, 1931 – January 2, 2020) was an American conceptual artist known for his work featuring found photography and appropriated images. He lived and worked in Santa Monica and Venice, California.\\nInitially a painter, Baldessari began to incorporate texts and photography into his canvases in the mid-1960s. In 1970 he began working in printmaking, film, video, installation, sculpture and photography. He created thousands of works which demonstrate—and, in many cases, combine—the narrative potential of images and the associative power of language within the boundaries of the work of art. His art has been featured in more than 200 solo exhibitions in the U.S. and Europe. His work influenced that of Cindy Sherman, David Salle, Annette Lemieux, and Barbara Kruger among others.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n1949–53 B.A., San Diego State College, California\\n1954–55 University of California, Berkeley\\n1955 University of California, Los Angeles\\n1955–57 M.A., San Diego State College, California\\n1957–59 Otis Art Institute, Los Angeles\\nChouinard Art Institute, Los Angeles\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nBaldessari was born in National City, California, to Hedvig Marie Jensen (1896-1950), a Danish nurse, and Antonio Baldessari (1877-1976), an Italian salvage dealer. Baldessari and his elder sister were raised in Southern California. He attended Sweetwater High School and San Diego State College. Baldessari grew up in relative isolation during the Great Depression.\\nIn 1959, Baldessari began teaching art in the San Diego school system. He taught for nearly three decades, in schools and junior colleges and community colleges, and eventually at the university level. When the University of California decided to open up a campus in San Diego, the new head of the Visual Art Department, Paul Brach, asked Baldessari to be part of the originating faculty in 1968. At UCSD he shared an office with David Antin. In 1970, Baldessari moved to Santa Monica, where he met many artists and writers, and began teaching at CalArts. His first classes included David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Mike Kelley, Ken Feingold, Tony Oursler, James Welling, Barbara Bloom, Matt Mullican, and Troy Brauntuch. While at CalArts, Baldessari taught \"the infamous Post Studio class\", which he intended to \"indicate people not daubing away at canvases or chipping away at stone, that there might be some other kind of class situation.\"  The class, which operated outside of medium-specificity, was influential in informing the context for addressing a student\\'s art practice at CalArts, and established a tradition of conceptual critique at CalArts that was carried on by artists such as Michael Asher. He quit teaching at CalArts in 1986, moving on to teach at UCLA, which he continued until 2008. At UCLA, his students included Elliott Hundley and Analia Saban.\\n\\n\\n== Work and themes ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early text paintings ===\\nBy 1966, Baldessari was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas. His early major works were canvas paintings that were empty but for painted statements derived from contemporary art theory. An early attempt of Baldessari\\'s included the hand-painted phrase \"Suppose it is true after all? WHAT THEN?\" (1967) on a heavily worked painted surface. However, this proved personally disappointing because the form and method conflicted with the objective use of language that he preferred to employ. Baldessari decided the solution was to remove his own hand from the construction of the image and to employ a commercial, lifeless style so that the text would impact the viewer without distractions. The words were then physically lettered by sign painters, in an unornamented black font. The first of this series presented the ironic statement \"A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE WITHOUT ANY ARTICULATION IS A DEAD EXPERIENCE\" (1967).\\nAnother work, Painting for Kubler (1967–68) presented the viewer theoretical instructions on how to view it and on the importance of context and continuity with previous works. This work referenced art historian George Kubler\\'s seminal book, The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things. The seemingly legitimate art concerns were intended by Baldessari to become hollow and ridiculous when presented in such a purely self-referential manner.\\n\\n\\n=== Disowning of early work ===\\nIn 1970, Baldessari and five friends burnt all of the paintings he had created between 1953 and 1966 as part of a new piece, titled The Cremation Project. The ashes from these paintings were baked into cookies and placed into an urn, and the resulting art installation consists of a bronze commemorative plaque with the destroyed paintings\\' birth and death dates, as well as the recipe for making the cookies. Through the ritual of cremation Baldessari draws a connection between artistic practice and the human life cycle. Thus the act of disavowal becomes generative as with the work of auto-destructive artist Jean Tinguely.\\n\\n\\n=== Juxtaposing text with images ===\\nBaldessari is best known for works that blend photographic materials (such as film stills), take them out of their original context and rearrange their form, often including the addition of words or sentences. Related to his early text paintings were his Wrong  series (1966–1968), which paired photographic images with lines of text from an amateur photography book, aiming at the violation of a set of basic \"rules\" on snapshot composition. In one of the works, Baldessari had himself photographed in front of a palm precisely so that it would appear that the tree were growing out of his head. His photographic California Map Project (1969) created physical forms that resembled the letters in \"California\" geographically near to the very spots on the map that they were printed. In the Binary Code Series, Baldessari used images as information holders by alternating photographs to stand in for the on-off state of binary code; one example alternated photos of a woman holding a cigarette parallel to her mouth and then dropping it away.\\nAnother of Baldessari\\'s series juxtaposed an image of an object such as a glass, or a block of wood, and the phrase \"A glass is a glass\" or \"Wood is wood\" combined with \"but a cigar is a good smoke\" and the image of the artist smoking a cigar. These directly refer to René Magritte\\'s The Treachery of Images; the images similarly were used to stand in for the objects described. However, the series also apparently refers to Sigmund Freud\\'s famous attributed observation that \"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar\", as well as to Rudyard Kipling\\'s \"… a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.\"\\nIn \"Double Bill\", a 2012 series of large inkjet prints, Baldessari paired the work of two selected artists (such as Giovanni di Paolo with David Hockney, or Fernand Léger with Max Ernst) on a single canvas, further altering the appropriated picture plane by overlaying his own hand-painted color additions. Baldessari then names only one of his two artistic \"collaborators\" on each canvas\\'s lower edge, such as …AND MANET or …AND DUCHAMP.\\n\\n\\n=== Arbitrary games ===\\nBaldessari has expressed that his interest in language comes from its similarities in structure to games, as both operate by an arbitrary and mandatory system of rules. In this spirit, many of his works are sequences showing attempts at accomplishing an arbitrary goal, such as Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line (1973), in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the \"best out of 36 tries\", with 36 being the determining number just because that is the standard number of shots on a roll of 35mm film. The writer eldritch Priest ties John Baldessari\\'s piece Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries) as an early example of post-conceptual art. This work was published in 1973 by a young Italian publisher: Giampaolo Prearo that was one of the first to believe and invest in the work of Baldessari. He printed two series one in 2000 copies and a second more precious reserved to the publisher in 500 copies. Following Baldessari\\'s seminal statement \"I will not make any more boring Art\", he conceived the work The Artist Hitting Various Objects with a Golf Club (1972–73), composed of 30 photographs of the artist swinging and hitting with a golf club objects excavated from a dump, as a parody of cataloging rather than a thorough straight classification.\\n\\n\\n=== Pointing ===\\nMuch of Baldessari\\'s work involves pointing, in which he tells the viewer not only what to look at but how to make selections and comparisons, often simply for the sake of doing so. Baldessari\\'s Commissioned Paintings (1969) series took the idea of pointing literally, after he read a criticism of conceptual art that claimed it was nothing more than pointing. Beginning with photos of a hand pointing at various objects, Baldessari then hired amateur yet technically adept artists to paint the pictures. He then added a caption \"A painting by [painter\\'s name]\" to each finished painting. In this instance, he has been likened to a choreographer, directing the action while having no direct hand in it, and these paintings are typically read as questioning the idea of artistic authorship. The amateur artists have been analogized to sign painters in this series, chosen for their pedestrian methods that were indifferent to what was being painted. Baldessari critiques formalist assessments of art in a segment from his video How We Do Art Now (1973), entitled \"Examining Three 8d Nails\", in which he gives obsessive attention to minute details of the nails, such as how much rust they have, or descriptive qualities such as which appears \"cooler, more distant, less important\" than the others.\\n\\n\\n=== Dots ===\\nCircular adhesive dots covering up the faces of photographed and painted portraits are a prevailing motif in Baldessari\\'s work from the mid-1980s onward. The artist himself suspected that, despite the broad array of approaches he\\'s taken over the course of his career, he will be best remembered as \"the guy who puts dots over peoples faces.\" Examples of the \"dot portraits\" would include—for  example—Bloody Sunday (1987) or Stonehenge with Two Persons (2005), though these works are numerous and it is difficult to identify an exemplar. The dots in these paintings evoke brightly colored price-stickers sometimes seen at garage sales, thrift stores or placed on retail items during a sale. Indeed, these stickers appear to have been the inspiration for the method. Describing his initial intuitive leap in this direction, Baldessari said, \"I just had these price stickers I was using for something else, in some graphic way and I put them on all the faces and I just felt like it leveled the playing field.\" The dot-faced works may sometimes be described as paintings, collages, or may be released as print editions.\\n\\n\\n=== Prints ===\\n\\nBaldessari began making prints in the early 1970s and continued to produce editions. He created his first print – I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art (1971) - as an edition to raise funds for the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax. The lithograph was created in conjunction with the now renowned exhibition for which – at Baldessari\\'s request – students endlessly wrote the phrase \"I will not make any more boring art\" on the gallery walls. The artist has since worked internationally with premier publishers including Arion Press of San Francisco, Brook Alexander Editions of New York, Cirrus Editions of Los Angeles, Crown Point Press of San Francisco, Edition Jacob Samuel of Santa Monica, Gemini G.E.L. of Los Angeles, Mixografia of Los Angeles, Multiples, Multi Editions of Los Angeles, Inc. of New York, and Peter Blum Editions of New York. His 1988 prints, The Fallen Easel and Object (with Flaw), represented a major shift in Baldessari\\'s approach to presentation, allowing a more complex relationship between his found imagery.  In both prints, Baldessari expertly contrasts unrelated photographs to suggest a mysterious and/or ominous undercurrent.  In the 1990s Baldessari began working with Mixografia Workshop to create three-dimensional prints utilizing their unique process of printing from metal molds. Baldessari\\'s interest in dimensionality has carried over to recent editions from Gemini G.E.L., including the Person with Guitar series (2005) and the print series Noses & Ears, Etc. (2006–2007) in which screen-printed images are constructed in three layers on sintra with hand painting. A 2007 publication from Gemini is God Nose, a cast aluminum piece that is designed to hang from the ceiling. Baldessari also contributed to the 2008 Artists for Obama portfolio, a set of prints in a limited edition of 150 published by Gemini G.E.L.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance and film ===\\nOriginally conceived in 1970, Unrealised Proposal for Cadavre Piece would have visitors look through a peep-hole and see a dead male body laid out with its feet towards them inside a climate-controlled vitrine, made to resemble Andrea Mantegna’s painting, The Lamentation over the Dead Christ (1480). Hans Ulrich Obrist, the co-director of London’s Serpentine Gallery and Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1, first attempted to realize Baldessari’s idea in 2011 and the resulting paperwork of failed attempts to procure a willing male cadaver was displayed in the exhibition \"11 Rooms\" at the Manchester International Festival.\\nBaldessari\\'s film Police Drawing documents a 1971 performance, Police Drawing Project. In this piece, the artist walked into a class of art students who had never seen him, set up a video camera to document the proceedings, and left the room. Subsequently, a police artist entered and, based on the students\\' testimony, sketched a likeness of the artist. In the black-and-white video I Am Making Art (1971), Baldessari stands facing the camera; for nearly 20 minutes, he strikes and then holds various poses — crossing his arms over his chest or swinging one arm out to one side or pointing directly at the lens, for example — and with each new gesture, he states \"I am making art.\" In a 1972 tribute to fellow artist Sol LeWitt, Baldessari sang lines from LeWitt\\'s thirty-five statements on conceptual art to the tune of popular songs. Other films include Teaching a Plant the Alphabet and the Inventory videos, also from 1972.\\nA riff on his 1977 color video Six Colourful Inside Jobs, in Thirteen Colorful Inside Jobs (2013) a room is repainted by a performer in a different colour every day for the duration of the exhibition, carefully following the instructions of the artist.\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\nBaldessari created his first ever sculpture, Beethoven\\'s Trumpet (with Ear) Opus # 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135 (2007), a series of 6 resin, fiberglass, bronze, aluminum, and electronics components in the form of a gigantic bronze trumpet extending off an oversized ear sculpted on the wall. The sculpture was produced with Beyer Projects. When the viewer speaks into the trumpet, the sounds causes a short recital of a phrase from a Beethoven string quartet. Baldessari has gone on to create sculptural works that often incorporate resin, bronze, and steel, such as the approximately 2.4 m carrot (Fake Carrot, 2016) and an elongated bronze figure trapped wearing a wooden barrel in a nod to Giacometti (Giacometti Variation, 2018).\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nBaldessari was in over 200 solo shows and 1,000 group shows in his six-decade career. He had his first gallery solo exhibition at the Molly Barnes Gallery in Los Angeles in 1968. His first retrospective exhibition in the U.S. in 1981 was mounted by the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, and traveled to the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, the CAM, Houston, the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, and the Museum Folkwang, Essen.\\nHis work has since been exhibited in:\\n\\nDocumenta V (1972) and VII (1982) \\nthe Whitney Biennial (1983) \\nthe Carnegie International (1985–86) \\nthe 47th Venice Biennial (1997) \\nSolo presentations of his work at museums have included exhibitions at:\\n\\nCornerhouse, Manchester (1995)\\nthe Albertina, Vienna (1999)\\nSprengel Museum, Hannover (1999–2000)\\nMuseo d\\'Arte Moderna Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto, Trento (2000–2001)\\nMuseum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, the Kunsthaus Graz, and Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin (2004)\\nMuseo Jumex, Mexico City (2017)\\nRetrospectives of his work were shown at MOCA, Los Angeles, which traveled to SFMOMA, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Whitney Museum and the Musée d\\'Art Contemporain, Montreal in 1990–92; at Cornerhouse, Manchester, and traveled to London, Stuttgart, Ljubljana, Oslo, and Lisbon in 1995-96 entitled \"This Not That\"; and Pure Beauty opened at the Tate Modern, London, in 2009 and travelled to MACBA, Barcelona; LACMA, Los Angeles; and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, through 2011.\\nThere was an \"Artist\\'s Choice: John Baldessari\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1994, and the artist was invited to curate the exhibition \"Ways of Seeing: John Baldessari Explores the Collection\" at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2006, and he created the exhibition design for \"Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images\" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\\nFor the 2017/2018 season at the Vienna State Opera he designed the large-scale image (176 m2 (1,890 sq ft)) \"Graduation\" for the ongoing series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nChoosing: Green Beans.

       "  'Lee Bul (Korean: 이불; 李昢; born 1964) is a South Korean artist who works in various mediums, including performance, sculpture, installation, architecture, printmaking, and media art. Lives and works in Seoul, Lee\\'s work has extended from the late 1980s to the present.\\nAs curators such as Stephanie Rosenthal and art historians such as Yeon Shim Chung have observed, Lee Bul\\'s artwork is shaped by both her social-political context and her personal experiences.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nLee Bul was born on January 25, 1964, in Yeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Raised by politically active parents while her country was under the rule of Park Chung Hee, Lee as a child witnessed a dramatically changing society from its margins, where she and her family repeatedly uprooted and relocated. After receiving B. F. A. in sculpture from Hongik University, Seoul, in 1987, Lee she was briefly involved in the Museum Group, alongside artists such as Choi Jeong Hwa. Although she has figured among \"New Generation\" artists (also called the \"3-8-6\" generation, with the 3 referring to a generation, born in the 1960s, who went to university in the 1980s), the art historian Yeon Shim Chung has argued that Lee\\'s artistic trajectory diverged at an early stage away from the oft-travelled artistic routes of her time.\\nAs Lee embarked on her own independent artistic practice, she pivoted sharply away from the cold, hard materials that founded her training in sculpture (namely, wood, stone, and metal). For her early performances in the 1990s, Yi Bul made sculptural creations made of fabric that connoted fleshy appendages and monstrously fantastical animals—and then wore them, and took to the streets of cities such as Seoul and Tokyo.\\nLee received an initial wave of wide recognition for her Majestic Splendor series (1991), which were installations of decomposing fish decorated with sequins within clear Mylar bags that explored themes of beauty, vulnerability, decay and dread. A prolific material of Korea\\'s textile industry, sequins connoted personal associations for Lee; her mother worked from home to craft bags and other accessories, which surrounded Lee throughout her childhood.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== I Need You (Monument) ===\\nFrom 1996 and 1999, Lee completed three mixed media installations that incorporate photographs of the artist with large scale inflatable forms. One of these installations, titled I Need You (Monument) (1996), features a swelling, phallic object with a photograph of an orientalize and lingerie-clad Lee on the front. Beneath the mass lies an array of pedals for viewers to further aerate the object. Notable is Lee\\'s juxtaposition of title and medium, which contrasts the vulnerability of inflatables with futile attempts to transcend history.\\n\\n\\n=== Majestic Splendor ===\\nA work that has been exhibited globally across multiple iterations, Lee first presented Majestic Splendor in 1991 in Seoul. Majestic Splendor features several real dead fish that are decorated with sequins, beads, and other small, sparkly items. They are placed in plastic bags and pinned to the wall of the gallery in a grid pattern. Over the course of the exhibition, the work emits a putrid odor. In 1997, during the Projects showing at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Majestic Splendor had to be removed because of its stench. After this Lee began using potassium permanganate, which is combustible, to help neutralize the smell.\\n\\n\\n=== Cyborg series ===\\nLee Bul\\'s Cyborg series (1997-2000) was first exhibited at the Artsonje Center in Seoul, Korea in 1998. Its techno-anthropomorphic bodies did not have a distinct biological gender, but seemed to possess female, hourglass shapes. A monster, titled Monster: Black (1998), a pile of excrement with multiple tentacles stands between them, which serves as a seven-foot tidal wave that towers over the sleek figures. Human and machine forms merge to give birth to a third. Female accentuated and idealized forms in ancient Greek culture, sexual charge of Japanese manga. Simultaneously well-proportioned, sensuous, and fragmented, the Cyborg works rose as symbols of human imperfection, despite the biological and cyber nature to transcend physical and mental limitations.  The cyborgs, W1-W4, for instance, are four white figures hang from the ceiling, casting ghostly shadows. The headless, one-armed and one-legged figures are provocatively sexualized, with waists, breasts and buttocks accentuated by the armor-like corsets that don them. Lee has stated, \"There\\'s a very strange, ambivalent mixture of nostalgia for an impossible purity... and a dread of uncontrollable and potentially destructive sexual energy and power sublimated into the forms of machines.”    Merging human and machine boundaries, the cyborg invokes the human experience induced by technological object and artist.\\nLee Bul\\'s cyborgs represent tropes for fear and fascination with \"the uncategorizable, the uncanny,” in her words.  Although her cyborgs stick to a coherent form in Amaryllis (1999), Supernova and Crysallis (2000), they have a disconnect from the viewer for their paradoxical characteristics: “male and female,” “glorious and sinister,” “familiar and alien,” “grotesque and strangely seductive.” \\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nIn 1998, Lee was selected as one of six shortlisted artists, including Huang Yong Ping, William Kentridge, Pipilotti Rist, Lorna Simpson and the eventual winner, Douglas Gordon, for the Hugo Boss Prize.\\nIn 2014, Lee won the Noon Award at Gwangju Biennale.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nLee has had solo exhibitions worldwide including Live Forever which toured the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York and The Power Plant in Toronto. She was selected as a finalist for the 1998 Hugo Boss Prize by the Guggenheim Museum, New York.\\nOther museums that have presented exhibitions of her work include Fondation Cartier, Paris; Domus Artium, Salamanca; Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; Japan Foundation, Tokyo; MAC, Musée d\\'Art Contemporain, Marseille; Le Consortium; Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia; Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland; and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\\nHer two-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, was titled Projects 57, Bul Lee, Matsui Chie was held in 1996. Bul Lee and Matsui Chie were presented as avant-garde female artists who were using installation art to challenge social norms.\\nIn March 2010, the Hara Museum ARC unveiled a permanent installation by Lee Bul entitled A Fragmentary Anatomy of Every Setting Sun. In February 2012, Tokyo\\'s Mori Art Museum mounted a mid-career survey exhibition, the artist\\'s largest exhibition to date.\\nThe Southbank Centres newly reopened Hayward Gallery hosted a survey of Lee\\'s artists work beginning at the end of May 2018, her first in London; which explores the artist\\'s extensive investigation into the body and its relationship to architectural space. Occupying the entire gallery, this exhibition includes documentation of early performances, sculptural works from the iconic Monster, Cyborg and Anagram series and recent immersive installations, as well as a selection of the artist\\'s studio drawings.\\nIn November 2020, an exhibition of the artist\\'s work opened at St. Petersburg\\'s Manege Central Exhibition Hall, \\'marking a first-time encounter between Lee Bul\\'s works and those by artists of the Russian avant-garde that influenced them.\\'\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) in New York announced in November 2023 that four new sculptures by Lee will be installed at its façade. Titled The Facade Commission: Lee Bul, the commission represents Lee\\'s first major project in the United States since her 2002 solo exhibition at the New Museum.  The works will be on view from 12 September in 2024 to 27 May 2025.\\n\\n\\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\\n\\n*denotes a two-person show\\n\\n\\n== Recognition and awards ==\\n\\n\\n== Market ==\\nLee\\'s works have been broadly exposed in art fairs around the world. In the recent STPI show in Singapore in 2023, the organiser presented the artist\\'s solo exhibition, Lee Bul: Prints, curated by Xiaoyu Weng. Over 60 works across five new series were mounted by STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery.\\nIn 2019 at Art Basel Hong Kong, Lee presented a new version of her replica Zeppelin \"Willing To Be Vulnerable - Metalized Balloon\" (2019) exhibited in 2018 in Hayward Gallery in London.\\nLee\\'s works have been sold at auctions, and the artist is represented by Lehmann Maupin and Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac respectively.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLee Bul studio',\n",
       "  'Chantal Joffe  (born 5 October 1969) is an American-born English artist based in London. Her often large-scale paintings generally depict women and children. In 2006, she received the prestigious Charles Wollaston Award from the Royal Academy.\\n\\n\\n== Life and education ==\\nChantal Joffe was born in St. Albans, Vermont, USA. Her younger brother is the contemporary artist and novelist Jasper Joffe. Their mother, Daryll Joffe, is also an artist, painting in watercolours.\\nJoffe completed her Foundation studies at Camberwell College of Arts (1987–88). She attended Glasgow School of Art in 1988–91, graduating with honours and receiving her BA in Fine Art. She received her MA in painting from the Royal College of Art, which she attended from 1992–94.\\nShe was honoured with the Delfina Studio Trust Award in 1994–96 and the Abbey Scholarship (British School at Rome) in 1998–99. Joffe lives in London.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nJoffe primarily paints expressive portraits of women and children, often in very large scale, sometimes 10 feet (3 m) tall. She has painted her own mother repeatedly, for over 30 years. In a 2009 interview with Stella McCartney, Joffe said, \"I really love painting women. Their bodies, their clothes – it all interests me.\" Source images for her personality-filled oil paintings include family photos, advertising, fashion magazines, and pornography. Working roughly from her photographic source material, Joffe introduces distortions to her depictions.\\nIn the McCartney interview, Joffe mentions the photography of Diane Arbus as an inspiration for her art: \"I find photography massively influential. Specifically, Diane Arbus, who I\\'ve been obsessed with my whole life. Her work has everything about the portrait of a human that you can ever want.\"\\nA critic for The Independent has said of her \"big rude paintings\" that \"she paints with a kind of easy control – effortless without being slick.\" He further points out that her paintings may give an initial impression of simplicity, charm, or childishness, but \"they have an unsettling quality which gives the exhibition an odd, rather menacing mood.\"\\nSome of her paintings are so large that she required scaffolding to work on them. Painting in huge, unfussy brushstrokes, she is unconcerned with stray drips and blobs of paint, and sometimes leaves old outlines visible. A reviewer noted that \"painting the heads up close also makes for large, wonky eyes and odd proportions, like Picasso\\nre-invented in manga.\"\\nIn 2006, Colette Meacher, editor of the British magazine Latest Art, described Joffe\\'s large paintings as \"simply exquisite representations of femininity\". Joffe often draws inspiration from fashion models, “photos of friends, the work of other artists” and images of women and children in realistic poses.\\nJoffe’s work is reminiscent of Alice Neel, with whom she was teamed up for an art show and Joni Mitchell, the Canadian singer, songwriter and figurative artist. This group of artists are known for feminist messages in their work.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and collections ==\\nChantal Joffe\\'s work has shown internationally in many exhibitions. She has had solo exhibitions in London, Milan, Venice, Paris, New York, Helsinki and Bologna. Her work has also been featured in many group exhibitions.\\nIn 2002, she participated in an exhibition entitled The Bold and The Beautiful, at The Pavilions, Mile End Park in London. This show marked the first time Chantal, her mother Daryll Joffe, and her brother Jasper Joffe were featured in an exhibit together.\\nShe won the £25,000 Charles Wollaston Award in the 2006 Royal Academy summer exhibition, for the \"most distinguished work in the exhibition\". The winning painting was Blond Girl – Black Dress. The judges praised the painting as \"an incredibly strong and striking painting ... There was no debate about the winner, the decision was reached unanimously.\"\\nJoffe has been featured in exhibitions at the Jewish Museum in New York City, including Using Walls, Floors, and Ceilings: Chantal Joffe in 2015 and Scenes from the Collection in 2019. Joffe\\'s work was included in the 2022 exhibition Women Painting Women at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.\\nJoffe\\'s work is in the collections of The New Art Gallery, Walsall, Saatchi Gallery (London, England),\\nBerardo Collection Museum (Lisbon, Portugal), Museo Arte Contemporanea Isernia (Isernia, Italy), Museo d\\'Arte Classica (Zola Predosa, Italy), the Jewish Museum (New York, USA), and The West Collection (Oaks, Pennsylvania).

       "  'Mark Lewis (born 1958) is a Canadian artist, best known for his film installations. He represented Canada at the 2009 Venice Biennale.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nLewis attended the Harrow College of Art (London) and the Polytechnic of Central London. In the 1980s, he studied with Victor Burgin, and was a friend of Laura Mulvey in 1981. He began his career as a photographer and from 1989 to 1997 lived in Vancouver, becoming part of the burgeoning photoconceptualism scene of the Vancouver School. In 1991, he produced the documentary Disgraced Monuments with Mulvey. In the mid‑1990s, he began making film-based installations . His first art film was Two Impossible Films (1995). In 1999, he eliminated sound from his film. His work focuses on the technology of film and the different genres which have developed in over 100 years of film history: he makes films that are often short, precise exercises on particular techniques, particularly rear projection (he believes the invention of rear projection in late 1920s was when film became modern) and playing film backwards. In 2020, he told an interviewer:\\n\\nThe only real technical invention of the cinema is the ability to go backward.\\nIn 2009, he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in Italy in an exhibition curated by Barbara Fischer. He has had solo museum exhibitions at the Musée du Louvre, Paris (2014), The Power Plant, Toronto (2015), the Art Gallery of Ontario which organized Mark Lewis. Canada (2017), the Museo de Arte de São Paulo (MASP) (2020), and at numerous other international venues such as the National Museum of Contemporary Art (Bucharest, Romania) (2005), the Hamburger Kunstverein (2005), Musée d’art Moderne du Grande Duc, Jean (Luxembourg) (2006), BFI Southbank (London) (2007), and at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands (2013). In 2022, a Mark Lewis Program was held by La Cinémathèque québécoise.\\nHis work is in many collections including the National Gallery of Canada; Museum of Modern Art New York; Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Paris; the Centre Pompidou (Paris), the Museo de Arte de São Paulo and the Musée d\\'art contemporain de Montréal, among others. In 2007, he received the Gershon Iskowitz Prize and the Brit Art Doc Foundation Award. In 2016, he received a Governor General\\'s Award in Visual and Media Arts.\\nHe lives and works in London, England which he moved to in 1997.

       "  'Sam Dillemans (born 17 January 1965) is a Belgian painter.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nSam Dillemans was born in Leuven, Flemish Brabant, Flanders, Belgium. After high school, Dillemans studied at several academies in Belgium and abroad. He obtained the French Higher National diploma of Plastic Expression Option Art. For some years he has been teaching drawing and painting at the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp and was a guest professor at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts of Flanders, also in Antwerp.\\nHe now lives and works in Borgerhout, Antwerp.\\nA documentary about his work and life, The Madness of Detail, was entered in the \"Creative Documentary\" category at the 21st International Festival of Audiovisual Programmes held in Biarritz, France in January 2008. and won the FIPA d\\'Or for best creative documentary.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nThe work of Dillemans has deep roots in European painting tradition. According to Dillemans, painters such as Vincent van Gogh, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and Pablo Picasso are not artists of the past, but artists of today and they continue inspire him in his work. To Dillemans it does not matter when something was painted, but how it was painted. The method of painting, how paint and brushes are used to seek or construct a striking image, is timeless.\\nHis work is a quest to find the visual equivalent for the complex interaction between imagination, feeling, consciousness and the painting technique itself. To achieve this goal, Dillemans says, painters have a difficult and at times tedious task to fulfill. They cannot not be satisfied with the clear perception of reality as an evidence of truth, but must try harder to understand more fully their subjects. With thick strokes and an impressive relief on the surface, Dillemans\\'s style contains a refined form of elasticity and plasticity.\\nThe process of creation is an important aspect in his work. During this process the paintings appear at times to become gradually more abstract. Dillemans is convinced that a painting only has a chance to take form once the paint begins to take on a life of its own. This style is more firmly rooted in the European tradition rather than that of abstract expressionism and although the strokes become autonomous and follow their own logic, the final form stills holds true to a recognizable and even classical form. Modernism, classicism and academism seem to come together in his work without any contradiction among the styles.\\n\\n\\n== World vision ==\\n\\nDillemans\\'s world vision is rather sombre. He works intensively and there is much action and movement within his work and in this way his painting becomes an intense occupation. Many painters of the past were also occupied by this same endeavour. Dillemans states that, \"a painter like Ingres drew on his right to be taken seriously. In his case it is about a beautiful aristocratic seriousness which has nothing to do with self glorification. Proof of this is that he was still copying Michelangelo at the age of sixty five.\"\\n\\n\\n== Stages ==\\n\\nBecause of his prolific work and creativity, Dillemans\\'s output has already passed through several different stages. During the period from 1993 to 2000, he did an intensive study of the female portrait, at times using his wife as a model.  A second period from 2000 to 2003 was a period of reflection during which he studied the old masters. This phase would also influence his later work. From 2003 onward he began a pugilistic painting project with numerous boxing scenes\\n in which a rhythmical movement between individual figures and the presence of physical bodies are in constant dialogue with the baroque. He also began a series of portraits of well known figures who he admires including  Ingres and the Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBooks\\nBekkers, Ludo; Stegeman, Elly (1995).

       "  'Jack Whitten (December 5, 1939 – January 20, 2018) was an American painter and sculptor. In 2016, he was awarded a National Medal of Arts.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nWhitten was born in 1939 in Bessemer, Alabama. Planning a career as an army doctor, Whitten entered pre-medical studies at Tuskegee Institute from 1957 to 1959. He also traveled to nearby Montgomery, Alabama to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak during the Montgomery bus boycott and was deeply moved by his vision for a changed America.\\nIn 1960, Whitten went to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to begin studying art and became involved in Civil Rights demonstrations there. Whitten participated in a march from downtown Baton Rouge to the state capitol. Whitten\\'s artist ability led him to be in charge of producing the signs and slogans to be used at that demonstration.\\nWhitten believed strongly about Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s nonviolent approach. However, witnessing the violent reactions from the segregationist made him realize that if he remained in the South he would turn violent himself. Angered by the violent resistance to change he experienced he moved to New York City in 1960. He enrolled immediately at the Cooper Union in the fall of 1960, graduating with a bachelor\\'s degree in fine art in 1964. Afterwards he remained in New York as a working artist, heavily influenced by the abstract expressionists then dominating the art community, especially Willem de Kooning and Romare Bearden.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nShortly after graduating from Cooper Union, Whitten had the opportunity to meet other black artists which included, Jacob Lawrence and Norman Lewis, while he remained in New York to start his art career.\\nWhitten\\'s art style was known to be abstract but he liked to refer to his art as art with truth and soul. A large number of Whitten\\'s artwork was inspired by his own experiences during the Civil Rights Movement. Whitten concluded that slavery obstructed the culture of people of color. Therefore, Whitten believed that it was his destiny to restore the culture through his pieces.\\nWhitten\\'s paintings dated back to as early as the 1960s. A large portion of Whitten\\'s artwork had a feathery, soft effect which Whitten discovered was desirable by placing a nylon mesh fabric over his wet acrylic paintings. Whitten also used a T-shaped tool, which he would call the \"developer\". Whitten would move the T-shaped tool across the surface of his art in one single motion. This technique was used to represent one point being related to another.\\n\\nOne of Whitten\\'s most famous pieces of work are his Black Monolith Series. Most of the work in this series was a homage or tribute to black activist, politicians and artists. The two known works from this series includes Whitten\\'s, Black Monolith III for Barbara Jordan, 1998 and the author of Invisible Man, Black Monolith II for Ralph Ellison, 1994.\\nWhitten\\'s work was featured in the Annual Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1972. The Whitney mounted a solo exhibition of his paintings in 1974. He has also had individual shows at numerous private galleries and universities, including a 10-year retrospective in 1983 at the Studio Museum in Harlem and an exhibition of memorial paintings in 2008 at the Atlanta Contemporary Arts Center in Atlanta, Georgia.\\nWhitten spent long portions of the summer in Crete, where he had a studio and made sculptures.\\nThroughout his career, Whitten concerned himself with the techniques and materials of painting and the relationship of artworks to their inspirations. At times he has pursued quickly-applied gestural techniques akin to photography or printmaking. At other times the deliberative and constructive hand is evident. The New York Times labeled him the father of a \"new abstraction.\"\\n\\nWhen the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center occurred, Whitten was at his studio on Lispenard Street in Tribeca. In the following years, he constructed a monumental painting, with ashes embedded into it, as a memorial of the day.\\nPresident Barack Obama awarded Whitten the 2015 National Medal of Arts Award.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 2013, curator Katy Siegel organized the exhibition Light Years: Jack Whitten, 1971-73  at the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. The exhibition featured many works created by Whitten between 1971 and 1973, which had never been exhibited before. In 2014, a retrospective exhibition was organized by The Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego. The exhibition traveled to the Wexner Center for the Arts in 2015 and to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis from September 13, 2015, to January 24, 2016  As part of his Walker engagement, Whitten wrote an Artist Op-Ed on racism and \"the role of art in times of unspeakable violence.\"\\nOn February 3, 2018 Crystal Bridges featured two of Whitten\\'s pieces from the 1970s; one of which was the Homage to Malcolm, 1970.\\nIn 2018, a retrospective \"Odyssey: Jack Whitten Sculpture 1963–2016\" was organized around the time of his passing and opened at the Baltimore Museum of Art from April 22, 2018, to July 29, 2018. The exhibition traveled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from September 6 to December 2, 2018, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from March 3 to May 27, 2019. In 2019, the first solo exhibition in a European institution was shown at Hamburger Bahnhof Museum für Gegenwart Berlin.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nWhitten was represented by Hauser & Wirth (2016–2018), Alexander Gray Associates (2007–2016) and Zeno X Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nAt 78, Whitten died on January 20, 2018.

       "  'Marco Polo di Suvero (born September 18, 1933), better known as Mark di Suvero, is an abstract expressionist sculptor and 2010 National Medal of Arts recipient.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nDi Suvero was born in Shanghai, China, to Matilde Millo di Suvero and Vittorio di Suvero (later known as Victor E.), both Italians of Sephardic Jewish descent. He was one of four children, the eldest being Victor di Suvero. His father was a U.S. Navy attaché for the Italian government, and the family lived in Shanghai until his father was relocated to Tientsin shortly after the birth of the family\\'s last son in 1936.\\nWith the outbreak of World War II, di Suvero immigrated to San Francisco with his family in February 1941 aboard the S.S. President Cleveland.\\nDi Suvero attended City College of San Francisco from 1953 to 1954, and then the University of California, Santa Barbara from 1954 to 1955. He began creating sculptures while at the University of California, Santa Barbara after learning that he was unable to make an original contribution as part of his philosophy major. He transferred to the University of California, Berkeley and graduated with a B.A. in philosophy in 1957.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter graduating from college, di Suvero moved to New York City in 1957 to begin a career as a sculptor. He worked part-time in construction and began to incorporate wood and metal from demolition sites into his work.\\nDi Suvero gained recognition among art critics with his first solo exhibit at the Green Gallery in Manhattan in the fall of 1960. The editor of Arts Magazine wrote, \"From now on nothing will be the same. One felt this at di Suvero\\'s show. Here was a body of work at once so ambitious and intelligent, so raw and clean, so noble and accessible, that it must permanently alter our standards of artistic effort.\"\\nOn March 26, 1960, while working at a construction site, he was involved in a near-fatal elevator accident, resulting in a broken back and severe spinal injuries. Treating physicians initially believed he would be unable to walk again. While in rehabilitation, however, he learned to work with an arc welder, which he used in later pieces. His recovery took four years. By 1965, he was able to walk without assistance. He is one of the 16 artists featured in Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists, a book that featured the accident and the subsequent effect it had on his health.\\nDi Suvero was a founding member of the Park Place Gallery in 1963 with Forrest Myers, Leo Valledor, Peter Forakis, and others. The gallery closed in July 1967.\\nDi Suvero protested the Vietnam War, and was arrested twice. He left the United States in 1971. During his four-year self-exile, he exhibited his works in the Netherlands and Germany, taught at the Università Internazionale dell\\'Arte, and lived in Chalon-sur-Saône, France where he maintained one of his studios on a barge until 1989. His French barge, Rêve de signes, has since been turned into La Vie des Formes, an atelier for emerging artists, which has been moored at Montceau-les-Mines since 2009.\\nIn 1975, his sculptures were exhibited in the Tuileries Garden in Paris, the first living artist to hold an exhibition there. He later returned to the United States and opened a studio in Petaluma, California in 1975. While the Petaluma studio is still active, di Suvero moved to New York City and opened a studio there.\\nIn 1976, the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan housed a retrospective exhibition of di Suvero\\'s smaller structures, while the city of New York exhibited some of his larger sculptures all around town. His 1966 sculpture, Praise for Elohim Adonai, was erected in front of the Seagram Building. In January 2024, the work was permanently installed adjacent to David Chipperfield\\'s East Building for the Saint Louis Art Museum. \\nHe founded the Athena Foundation in 1977 and Socrates Sculpture Park in 1986, both of which function to assist artists. In 2019, his tallest piece, E=MC 2, was moved from France to the Storm King Art Center in upstate New York.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nDi Suvero lives in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens in New York City with his second wife, Kate D. Levin, who he married in 1993, and their daughter. Levin, a former City College of New York teacher, served as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs from 2002 to 2013, and has worked in  the Ed Koch and Michael Bloomberg administrations. Di Suvero was previously married to architect Maria Teresa Caparrotta, whom he met while living in Italy, but later divorced.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\n\\nHis early works were large outdoor pieces that incorporated wooden timbers from demolition buildings, tires, scrap metal, and structural steel. This exploration has transformed over time into a focus on H-beams and heavy steel plates. Many of the pieces contain sections that are allowed to swing and rotate giving the overall forms a considerable degree of motion. He prides himself on his hands-on approach to the fabrication and installation of his work. Di Suvero pioneered the use of a crane as a sculptor\\'s working tool.\\nHis style is associated with the abstract expressionism movement but directly evokes the spirit of the Russian post-revolution constructivism. Constructivism is strongly associated with concepts of a utopian socialist reconstruction but came crashing down when the Stalin and Hitler empires failed. Di Suvero is the first artist post-war to revive the constructivist movement. The sculptures can be touched, and they are resistant enough to be climbed on.\\nSome of his work includes:\\n\\nPre-Columbian (1964), acquired by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 2000\\nBunyon\\'s Chess (1965) at Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle\\nPoland (1966) at Lynden Sculpture Garden in Milwaukee\\nAre Years What?

The film was produced by François De Menil and by art historian Barbara Rose, and it featured music composed by Philip Glass. The film was released as a DVD in 2012.\\nIn May 2013, some of his most famous sculptures were exhibited in Crissy Field in San Francisco.\\n\\n\\n== Critics ==\\nSome critics deny the novelty of di Suvero\\'s art, arguing he just inflated an established concept to greater dimensions. In 1975, William Rubin argued he merely vulgarized the style of abstract expressionism set forth by Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline. When Pax Jerusalemme was installed in a prominent spot in front of the Legion of Honor in 2000, Kenneth Baker in the San Francisco Chronicle dismissed it as \"mediocre.\" But remarking on the installation of the artist\\'s colossal E=MC 2 at the Storm King Art Center, Jason Farago in the New York Times wrote that di Suvero \"understands better than almost any artist the distinction between size and scale—and this serene work, breathing easy in Storm King\\'s largest field, feels as approachable as a family member.\"\\n\\n\\n== Honors and awards ==\\n2000: International Sculpture Center\\'s Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award\\n2005: Winner in the Arts and Humanities category at the 11th Annual Heinz Awards, which came with a $250,000 prize.\\n2010:\\nMedal of the Archives of American Art by the Smithsonian Institution\\nWinner of the National Medal of Arts, presented on March 2, 2011, by President Barack Obama.\\n2013: American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPark Place Gallery\\nJohn Raymond Henry\\nAbstract expressionism\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nNational Medal of Arts biography\\nThe Heinz Awards biography\\nISC Lifetime Achievement Award\\nMark di Suvero and di Suvero family papers, 1934-2005, at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art\\nSocrates Sculpture Park website\\nPatients\\' Stories.

       "  'Alfredo Jaar (English: ; Spanish: [ˈɟʝaɾ]; born 1956) is a Chilean-born artist, architect, photographer and filmmaker who lives in New York City. He is mostly known as an installation artist, often incorporating photography and covering socio-political issues and war—the best known perhaps being the 6-year-long The Rwanda Project about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. He has also made numerous public intervention works, like The Skoghall Konsthall one-day paper museum in Sweden, an early electronic billboard intervention A Logo For America, and The Cloud, a performance project on both sides of the Mexico-USA border. He has been featured on Art:21. He won the Hasselblad Award for 2020.\\nHe is the father of musician and composer Nicolas Jaar.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJaar was born in 1956 in Santiago de Chile. From age 5 to 16, he lived in Martinique before moving back to Chile. In 1982, he moved permanently to New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nJaar art is usually politically motivated, with strategies of representation of real events, the faces of war or the globalized world, and sometimes with a certain level of viewer participation (in the case of many public interventions and performances).\\n\"There\\'s this huge gap between reality and its possible representations.

       "  'Roman Opałka (Polish: [ˈrɔman ɔˈpawka]; 27 August 1931 – 6 August 2011) was a French-born Polish painter, whose works are mostly associated with conceptual art.\\nOpałka was born on 27 August 1939 in Abbeville-Saint-Lucien, France, to Polish parents. The family returned to Poland in 1946 and Opałka studied lithography at a graphics school before enrolling in the School of Art and Design in Łódź. He later earned a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. He moved back to France in 1977. Opałka lived in Teille, near Le Mans, and Venice. He died at age 79 after falling ill while on holiday in Italy. He was admitted to a hospital near Rome and died there a few days later, on 6 August 2011.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nIn 1965, in his studio in Warsaw, Opałka began painting numbers from one to infinity. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the canvas and finishing in the bottom right-hand corner, the tiny numbers were painted in horizontal rows. Each new canvas, which the artist called a \"detail\", took up counting where the last left off. Each \"detail\" has the same size (196 × 135 cm), the dimension of his studio door in Warsaw. All details have the same title, \"1965 / 1 – ∞\"; the project had no definable end, and the artist pledged his life to its ongoing execution: \"All my work is a single thing, the description from number one to infinity. A single thing, a single life\", \"the problem is that we are, and are about not to be\". He had contemplated and tried many different ways to visualize time before settling on this life\\'s work.\\nOver the years there were changes to the process. In Opałka\\'s first details he painted white numbers onto a black background. In 1968 he changed to a grey background \"because it\\'s not a symbolic colour, nor an emotional one\", and in 1972 he decided that he would gradually lighten this grey background by adding 1% more white to the ground with each passing detail. He expected to be painting virtually in white on white by the time he reached 7777777 (he did not use commas or number breaks in the works): \"My objective is to get up to the white on white and still be alive.\" As of July 2004, he had reached 5.5 million. Adopting this rigorously serialized approach, Opałka aligned himself with other artists of the time who explored making art through systems and mathematics, like Daniel Buren, On Kawara, and Hanne Darboven. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert and in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo.\\nIn 1968 Opałka introduced to the process a tape recorder, speaking each number into the microphone as he painted it, and also began taking passport-style photographs of himself standing before the canvas after each day\\'s work.\\nIn 2007 Opałka participated at the symposium \"Personal Structures Time–Space–Existence\" a project initiated by the artist Rene Rietmeyer.\\nThe final number he painted was 5607249.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nOpałka participated in many of the art world’s most important international exhibitions, including Documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1977; the São Paulo Bienal in 1987; and the Venice Biennale, in 1995, 2003, 2011 and 2013. He was represented in Paris and New York by Yvon Lambert, in Venice by Galleria Michela Rizzo and, for many years, at John Weber in New York.\\nIn 2003, Les Rencontres d\\'Arles exhibited his work through \"L’œuvre photographique\"\\'s exhibition (the curator was Alain Julien-Laferrière).\\nIn 2017, Opałka has made part of the exhibition \"Il mio corpo nel tempo / Lüthi Ontani Opalka\", Galleria d\\'Arte Moderna, Verona 2017. Catalogue Manfredi Edizioni.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nOpałka\\'s works can be found in the permanent collections of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and New York’s Museum of Modern Art among others.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nOpałka won the celebrated Grand Prize of the 7th International Biennial of Arts and Graphics of Cracow in 1969, the C. K. Norwid Art Critics Award in 1970, Franceʼs National Painting Prize in 1991 and Germanyʼs Goslarer Kaiserring in 1993. He was named Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and of Letters) in France. In 2009, he was awarded Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski. In 2011, the President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski awarded him with Commander\\'s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In 2011 Opalka was awarded by the European Cultural Centre Art Award for his life long depiction of \"Time Passing\".\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn 2005 the German art project \"Camera Obscura 2005/1-∞\" was initiated as an homage to Opałka\\'s life and work. It honours his \"1965 / 1 – ∞\" work by selling camera obscuras — with two pinholes — over the internet auction platform eBay. Each pinhole is sold to another buyer, and the camera is subsequently sent back to the project to be developed and exhibited in its gallery, as well as online.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\n\"Roman Opałka\".

       "  'William Kentridge (born 28 April 1955) is a South African artist best known for his prints, drawings, and animated films, especially noted for a sequence of hand-drawn animated films he produced during the 1990s. The latter are constructed by filming a drawing, making erasures and changes, and filming it again. He continues this process meticulously, giving each change to the drawing a quarter of a second to two seconds\\' screen time. A single drawing will be altered and filmed this way until the end of a scene. These palimpsest-like drawings are later displayed along with the films as finished pieces of art.\\nKentridge has created art work as part of design of theatrical productions, both plays and operas. He has served as art director and overall director of numerous productions, collaborating with other artists, puppeteers and others in creating productions that combine drawings and multi-media combinations.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nKentridge was born in Johannesburg in 1955 to Sydney Kentridge and Felicia Geffen, a Jewish family. Both were advocates (barristers) who represented people marginalized by the apartheid system. He was educated at King Edward VII School in Houghton, Johannesburg. He showed great artistic promise from an early age, and began taking classes with charcoal at age eight. In 2016, he became perhaps the first artist to have a catalogue raisonné devoted exclusively to his juvenilia.\\nHe earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics and African Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand and then a diploma in Fine Arts from the Johannesburg Art Foundation. In the early 1980s, he studied mime and theatre at the L\\'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris. He originally hoped to become an actor, but said later: \"I was fortunate to discover at a theatre school that I was so bad at being an actor [... that] I was reduced to an artist, and I made my peace with it.\" Between 1975 and 1991, he was acting and directing with Johannesburg\\'s Junction Avenue Theatre Company. In the 1980s, he worked on television films and series as an art director.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nKentridge believed that being ethnically Jewish gave him a unique position as a third-party observer in South Africa. His parents were lawyers, well-known for their defence of victims of apartheid. The basics of South Africa\\'s socio-political condition and history must be known to grasp his work fully, much the same as in the cases of such artists as Francisco Goya and Käthe Kollwitz.\\nKentridge has practiced expressionist art: form often alludes to content and vice versa.  The feeling that is manipulated by the use of palette, composition and media, among others, often plays an equally vital role in the overall meaning as the subject and narrative of a given work. One must use one\\'s gut reactions as well as one\\'s interpretive skills to find meaning in Kentridge\\'s work, much of which reveals very little content. Due to the sparse, rough and expressive qualities of Kentridge\\'s handwriting, the viewer sees a sombre picture upon first glance, an impression that is perpetuated as the image illustrates a vulnerable and uncomfortable situation. \\nAspects of social injustice that have transpired over the years in South Africa have often become fodder for Kentridge\\'s pieces. Casspirs Full of Love, viewable at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, appears to be nothing more than heads in boxes to the average American viewer, but South Africans know that a casspir is a vehicle used to put down riots, a kind of a crowd-control tank.\\nThe title, Casspirs Full of Love, written along the side of the print, is suggestive of the narrative and is oxymoronic. A casspir full of love is much like a bomb that bursts with happiness – it is an intangible improbability. The purpose of a machine such as this is to instil \"peace\" by force, but Kentridge noted that it was used as a tool to keep lower-class natives from taking colonial power and money.\\n\\n\\n=== Prints and drawings ===\\n\\nBy the mid-1970s, Kentridge was making prints and drawings. In 1979, he created 20 to 30 monotypes, which soon became known as the \"Pit\" series. In 1980, he executed about 50 small-format etchings which he called the \"Domestic Scenes\". These two extraordinary groups of prints served to establish Kentridge\\'s artistic identity, an identity he has continued to develop in various media. Despite his ongoing exploration of non-traditional media, the foundation of his art has always been drawing and printmaking.\\nIn 1986, he began a group of charcoal and pastel drawings based, very tenuously, on Watteau\\'s Embarkation for Cythera.  These extremely important works, the best of which reflect a blasted, dystopic urban landscape, demonstrate the artist\\'s growing consciousness of the flexibility of space and movement.\\nIn 1996–1997, he produced a portfolio of eight prints titled Ubu Tells the Truth, based on Alfred Jarry\\'s 1896 play Ubu Roi.  These prints also relate to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission conducted in South Africa after the end of apartheid. One of the stark and somber prints from this portfolio, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is illustrated.\\nThe Six Drawing Lessons, delivered as part of The Norton Lectures series at Harvard University in 2012, consider the work in the studio and the studio as a place of making meaning developed.  A series of large drawings of trees in Indian ink on found encyclopedia pages, torn up and reassembled, analyzes the form of different trees indigenous to southern Africa. Drawn across multiple pages from books, each drawing is put together as a puzzle – the single pages first painted, then the whole pieced together.\\n\"My drawings don\\'t start with a \\'beautiful mark\\',\" writes Kentridge, thinking about the activity of printmaking as being about getting the hand to lead the brain, rather than letting the brain lead the hand. \"It has to be a mark of something out there in the world. It doesn\\'t have to be an accurate drawing, but it has to stand for an observation, not something that is abstract, like an emotion.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Animated films ===\\nBetween 1989 and 2003, Kentridge made a series of nine short films, which he eventually gathered under the title 9 Drawings for Projection. In 1989, he began the first of those animated movies, Johannesburg, 2nd Greatest City After Paris. The series runs through Monument (1990), Mine (1991), Sobriety, Obesity & Growing Old (1991), Felix in Exile (1994), History of the Main Complaint (1996), Weighing and Wanting (1997), and Stereoscope (1999), up to Tide Table (2003) and Other Faces, 2011.\\nFor the series, he used a technique that would become a feature of his work – successive charcoal drawings, always on the same sheet of paper, contrary to the traditional animation technique in which each movement is drawn on a separate sheet.  In this way, Kentridge\\'s videos and films came to keep the traces of the previous drawings. His animations deal with political and social themes from a personal and, at times, autobiographical point of view, since the author includes his self-portrait in many of his works.\\nThe political content and unique techniques of Kentridge\\'s work have propelled him into the realm of South Africa\\'s top artists.  Working with what is in essence a very restrictive media, using only charcoal and a touch of blue or red pastel, he has created animations of astounding depth.  A theme running through all of his work is his peculiar way of representing his birthplace.  While he does not portray it as the militant or oppressive place that it was for black people, he does not emphasise the picturesque state of living that white people enjoyed during apartheid either; he presents instead a city in which the duality of man is exposed. In a series of nine short films, he introduces two characters – Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitlebaum.  These characters depict an emotional and political struggle that ultimately reflects the lives of many South Africans in the pre-democracy era.\\nIn an introductory note to Felix In Exile, Kentridge writes, \\n\\n\"In the same way that there is a human act of dismembering the past there is a natural process in the terrain through erosion, growth, dilapidation that also seeks to blot out events. In South Africa this process has other dimensions. The very term \\'new South Africa\\' has within it the idea of a painting over the old, the natural process of dismembering, the naturalization of things new.\"\\nNot only in Felix In Exile but in all his animated works, the concepts of time and change comprise a major theme. He conveys it through his erasure technique, which contrasts with conventional cel-shaded animation, whose seamlessness de-emphasizes the fact that it is actually a succession of hand-drawn images. This he implements by drawing a key frame, erasing certain areas of it, re-drawing them and thus creating the next frame. He is able in this way to create as many frames as he wants based on the original key frame simply by erasing small sections.  Traces of what has been erased are still visible to the viewer; as the films unfold, a sense of fading memory or the passing of time and the traces it leaves behind are portrayed. Kentridge\\'s technique grapples with what is not said, what remains suppressed or forgotten but can easily be felt.\\nIn the nine films that follow Soho Eckstein\\'s life, an increasing vehemence is placed on the health of the individual and contemporary South African society. Conflicts between anarchic and bourgeois individualistic beliefs, again a reference to the duality of man, indicate the idea of social revolution by poetically disfiguring surrounding buildings and landscapes. Kentridge states that, although his work does not focus on apartheid in a direct and overt manner, but on the contemporary state of Johannesburg, his drawings and films are certainly influenced by the brutalised society that resulted from the regime.\\nAs for more direct political issues, Kentridge says his art presents ambiguity, contradiction, uncompleted movements and uncertain endings, all of which seem like insignificant subtleties but can be attributed to most of the calamity presented in his work. In a mixed-media triptych entitled The Boating Party (1985), based on Renoir\\'s painting of a similar name, the havoc caused by a seemingly-uninterested aristocracy is perhaps his most severe comment on the state of South Africa during apartheid.  The languid diners sit at ease while the surrounding area is ravaged, torn and burned, a contrast that is reflected in his style and choice of colours.\\nIn 1988, Kentridge co-founded Free Film-makers Co-Operative in Johannesburg. In 1999, he was appointed a film-maker by Stereoscope. \\n\\n\"Purely in the context of my own work,\" he wrote in a published playscript of his celebrated Ubu and the Truth Commission, \"I would repeat my trust in the contingent, the inauthentic, the whim, the practical, as strategies for finding meaning.  I would repeat my mistrust in the worth of Good Ideas. And state a belief that somewhere between relying on pure chance on the one hand, and the execution of a programme on the other, lies the most uncertain but the most fertile ground for the work we do [...]. I think I have shown that it is not the clear light of reason or even aesthetic sensibility which determines how one works, but a constellation of factors only some of which we can change at will.\"In 2001, Creative Time aired his film Shadow Procession on the NBC Astrovision Panasonic screen in Times Square.\\n\\n\\n=== Opera ===\\nKentridge has been commissioned to create stage design and act as a theatre director in opera. His political perspective is expressed in his opera directions, which involves different layers: stage direction, animation movies, and influences of the puppet world. He has staged Il ritorno d\\'Ulisse in patria (Monteverdi), Die Zauberflöte (Mozart) and The Nose (Shostakovich). Following the last work, he collaborated with the French composer François Sarhan on a short show called Telegrams from the Nose, for which he made the stage and set design for the performance.\\nIn November 2015 his \"provocative and visually stunning new staging\" of Berg\\'s Lulu, premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, a co-production with the English National Opera and the Dutch National Opera. On 8 August 2017, William Kentridge\\'s Wozzeck (Alban Berg) premiered at the Salzburg Festival and received enthusiastic reactions. \\nIn 2023, Kentridge received the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Opera for the production of \\'Sybil\\' at the Barbican Theatre, London.\\n\\n\\n=== Tapestries ===\\nKentridge\\'s protean artistic investigation continues in his series of tapestries begun in 2001. The tapestries stem from a series of drawings in which he conjured shadowy figures from ripped construction paper; he made a collage of these with the web-like background of nineteenth-century atlas maps. To adapt these figures as tapestry, Kentridge worked in close collaboration with the Johannesburg-based Stephens Tapestry Studio, mapping cartoons from enlarged photographs of the drawings and hand-picking dyes to colour the locally spun mohair (goat hair).\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\nIn 2009, Kentridge, in partnership with Gerhard Marx, created a 10m-tall sculpture for his home city of Johannesburg entitled Fire Walker. In 2012 his sculpture, Il cavaliere di Toledo, was unveiled in Naples. Rebus (2013), referring in title to the allusional device using pictures to represent words or parts of words, is a series of bronze sculptures that form two distinct images when turned to a certain angle; when paired in correspondence, for example, a final image – a nude – is created from two original forms – a stamp and a telephone.\\n\\n\\n=== Murals ===\\nIn 2016, the anniversary of Rome\\'s legendary founding in 753BC, Kentridge unveiled Triumphs and Laments, a monumental mural along the right bank of the river Tiber. The 550m-long frieze depicting a procession of more than 80 figures from Roman mythology to the present is Kentridge’s largest public work to date. To celebrate its launch, he and his long-time collaborator, the composer Philip Miller, devised a series of performances featuring live shadow play and more than 40 musicians.\\n\\n\\n== Family ==\\nKentridge is married to Anne Stanwix, a rheumatologist, and they have three children. A third-generation South African of Lithuanian-Jewish heritage, he is the son of the South African lawyer Sydney Kentridge and the lawyer and activist Felicia Kentridge.\\n\\n\\n== Films ==\\n\\nKentridge\\'s films were shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nKentridge\\'s works are included in the following permanent collections: Honolulu Museum of Art, the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), and the Tate Modern (London).  An edition of the five-channel video installation The Refusal of Time (2012), which debuted at documenta 13, was jointly acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In 2015, Kentridge gave the definitive collection of his archive and art – films, videos and digital works – to the George Eastman Museum, one of the world\\'s largest and oldest photography and film collections.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n\\nKentridge\\'s Five Themes exhibit was included in the 2009 Time 100, an annual list of the one hundred top people and events in the world. That same year, the exhibition was awarded First Place in the 2009 AICA (International Association of Art Critics Awards) Best Monographic Museum Show Nationally category.\\nIn 2012, Kentridge was in residence at Harvard University invited to deliver the distinguished Charles Eliot Norton lectures in early 2012.\\n That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nKentridge\\'s artworks are among the most sought-after and expensive works in South Africa: \"a major charcoal drawing by world-renowned South African artist William Kentridge could set you back some £250,000\". Kentridge is represented by Goodman Gallery, Lia Rumma Gallery and Hauser & Wirth (since 2024). From 1999 to 2024, he worked with Marian Goodman Gallery.\\nThe South African record for Kentridge is R6.6 million ($320,000), set at Aspire Art Auctions in Johannesburg in 2018. One of his bronze pieces reached $1.5 million at Sotheby\\'s New York in 2013.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nCameron, Dan; Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn; Coetzee, JM.
