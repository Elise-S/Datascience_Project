Emily Foster Stone is an American mathematician whose research includes work in fluid dynamics and dynamical systems. She is a professor of mathematics at the University of Montana, where she chairs the Department of Mathematical Sciences. She is also chair of the Activity Group on Dynamical Systems of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.


== Education ==
Stone majored in physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, graduating in 1984. She completed her Ph.D. in theoretical and applied mechanics at Cornell University in 1989; her dissertation, A Study of Low-Dimensional Models for the Wall Region of a Turbulent Boundary Layer, was supervised by Philip Holmes.


== Career ==
Stone taught at Arizona State University from 1992 to 1993, and at Utah State University from 1993 to 2004, before joining the University of Montana faculty in 2004.


== Service ==
Stone was elected as chair of the Activity Group on Dynamical Systems (SIAG-DS) of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in 2020. She was elected Vice Chair of the same SIAG in 2022.
