Maria Assunta Pozio (died 2018) was an Italian mathematician known for her research in partial differential equations, including a collaboration with the Swiss mathematician Catherine Bandle. A special issue of Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni was dedicated to her memory. Pozio received a Laurea degree (effectively equivalent to a PhD) from Sapienza University of Rome in 1977.
