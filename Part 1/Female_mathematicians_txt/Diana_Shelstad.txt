Diana Frost Shelstad (born August 19, 1947) is a mathematician known for her work in automorphic forms.  She is a professor at Rutgers University–Newark.  She earned her doctorate at Yale University in 1974 studying real reductive algebraic groups.


== Research ==
Shelstad has been a key player in the development of the theory of endoscopy which is part of Langlands program.  She co-conjectured the fundamental lemma with Robert Langlands in 1984.  After over 20 years, this conjecture was solved by Ngô Bảo Châu in 2009, thus opening up a wealth of consequences.
In 1999, Shelstad developed a theory of twisted endoscopy with Robert Kottwitz.  In 2008–9 she completed work on tempered endoscopy.


== Awards and honors ==
In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
