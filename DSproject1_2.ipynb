              "  'Irmgard Flügge-Lotz, née Lotz (16 July 1903 – 22 May 1974) was a German-American mathematician and aerospace engineer. She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in hysteresis control systems; such applications include guidance systems, electronics, fire-control systems, and temperature regulation. She became the first female engineering professor at Stanford University in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nLotz was born in Hamelin, Germany on 16 July 1903. She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films. After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist, was drafted for military service in World War I, the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls\\' Gymnasium in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family. She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the Leibniz University Hannover to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:\\n\\nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.\\nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes. In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.\\nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in Göttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe. She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use. She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally. Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.\\nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz\\'s career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics. However, Flügge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\". The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research. Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann Göring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.\\nAt DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems. These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application. She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.\\n\\n\\n=== Move to France ===\\nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany. After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d\\'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.\\n\\n\\n== Career at Stanford University ==\\nAlthough Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz\\'s reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.\\nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory. At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers. In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.\\n\\n\\n=== Discontinuous automatic control theory ===\\nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:\\n\\nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.\\nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.\\n\\n\\n=== Tenure ===\\nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant. The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nFlügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag. During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:\\n\\nProfessor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman\\'s intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.\\nShe was also a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a member of Sigma Xi, and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.\\nIn honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award\" was established by the Applied Mechanics Division at Stanford University for outstanding graduate students.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nFlügge-Lotz\\'s health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from arthritis that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in Stanford Hospital after a long illness.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nDie Erwärmung des Stempels beim Stauchvorgang, Dissertation TH Hannover 1929\\nDiscontinuous Automatic Control, Princeton University Press 1953\\nDiscontinuous and Optimal Control, McGraw Hill 1968\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nJ.

              "  'Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian: Софья Васильевна Ковалевская), born Korvin-Krukovskaya (15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1850 – 10 February 1891), was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was \"the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century\".:\\u200a255\\u200a\\nHistorian of mathematics Roger Cooke writes:\\n\\n... the more I reflect on her life and consider the magnitude of her achievements, set against the weight of the obstacles she had to overcome, the more I admire her.  For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\n\\nHer sister was the socialist Anne Jaclard.\\nThere are several alternative transliterations of her name. She herself used Sophie Kowalevski (or occasionally Kowalevsky) in her academic publications.\\n\\n\\n== Background and early education ==\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (née Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the Imperial Russian Army as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Polibino, his family estate in Pskov Oblast in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian–Polish descent (Polish on his father\\'s side), with possible partial ancestry from the royal Corvin family of Hungary, and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father\\'s side.)\\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor Schubert (1758−1825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya\\'s maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789−1865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father\\'s student days. She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies. Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of A. N. Strannoliubskii. In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.\\nAlthough the word nihilist (нигилист) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (шестидесятники):\\n\\nAfter the famous writer Ivan Turgenev used the word nihilist to refer to Bazarov, the young hero of his 1862 novel Fathers and Children, a certain segment of the \"new people\" adopted that name as well, despite its negative connotations in most quarters.... For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.:\\u200a2–4\\u200a \\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.\\n\\n\\n== Student years ==\\n\\nIn April 1869, following Sofia\\'s and Vladimir\\'s brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained permission to audit classes with the professors\\' approval at the University of Heidelberg.  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.:\\u200a87–89\\u200a  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to the University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot\\'s Sunday salons. There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot\\'s instigation, on \"woman\\'s capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing Middlemarch at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke\\'s mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\" This was well before Kovalevskaya\\'s notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.:\\u200a104–106\\u200a With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia\\'s and Anyuta\\'s father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, Jaclard was saved.:\\u200a107–108\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn\\'s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.\\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity of local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\\n\\n\\n== Last years in Germany and Sweden ==\\n\\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her sex.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.\\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.\\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden. Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler\\'s sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya\\'s death the two women shared a close friendship.\\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d\\'un corps pesant autour d\\'un point fixe, où l\\'intégration s\\'effectue à l\\'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\". Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"Kovalevskaya top\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is \"completely integrable\" other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.\\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.:\\u200a218\\u200a After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the academy\\'s rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, A Russian Childhood, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, Nihilist Girl (1890).\\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband, but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.:\\u200a18\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya died of epidemic influenza complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.:\\u200a231\\u200a She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s mathematical results, such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz, a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina (translated into English by M. Burov with the title Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R. Cooke.\\n\\n\\n== Tributes ==\\nSonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day is a grant-making program of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics. While the AWM currently does not have grant money to support this program, multiple universities continue the program with their own funding.\\nThe Kovalevsky Lecture is sponsored annually by the AWM and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics.\\nThe Kovalevskaia Fund, founded in 1985 with the purpose of supporting women in science in developing countries, was named in her honor.\\nThe lunar crater Kovalevskaya is named in her honor.\\nA gymnasium in Velikiye Luki and a progymnasium in Vilnius are named after Sofya Kovalevskaya.\\nThe Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation of Germany bestows a bi-annual Sofia Kovalevskaya Award to promising young researchers.\\nSaint Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm have streets named in honor of Kovalevskaya.\\nOn 30 June 2021, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 22 or \"Sofya\", COSPAR 2021-059AS) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 constellation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== In film ==\\nKovalevskaya has been the subject of three film and TV biographies.\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1956) directed by Iosef Shapiro, starring Yelena Yunger, Lev Kolesov and Tatyana Sezenyevskaya.\\nBerget på månens baksida (\"A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon\") (1983) directed by Lennart Hjulström, starring Gunilla Nyroos as Sofja Kovalewsky and Bibi Andersson as Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, and sister to Gösta Mittag-Leffler.\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1985 TV) directed by Azerbaijani director Ayan Shakhmaliyeva, starring Yelena Safonova as Sofia.\\n\\n\\n== In fiction ==\\nLittle Sparrow: A Portrait of Sophia Kovalevsky (1983), Don H.

She worked with Ed Dubinsky to develop Special Interest Groups inside MAA. She received the Citation for Public Service from the Council of the American Mathematical Society in 1992.\\nIn 1999 Sward retired from the Executive Director position and spent a year sailing in The Bahamas. She switched careers again to work with the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation as senior director for education and environment and then in 2004 became Deputy Executive Director of the Audubon Naturalist Society of the Central Atlantic States. She led their Environmental Education department until her death in 2008. During her time there she worked to get the ANS Nature Preschool started, began the GreenKids program (an outreach program that sends naturalists to Montgomery County, Maryland, schools), and helped start the Loudoun Environmental Stewardship Alliance.

She received her bachelor's degree in mathematics from Cornell College in Iowa and went on to receive a Ph.M. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin in 1939. Livesay worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos from 1944-1946 where she was assigned to calculate the predicted shockwave propulsion from an implosion type bomb.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nNaomi Mary Livesay was born in northern Montana in 1916. She earned her B.A. in mathematics from Cornell College in Iowa and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Afterwards, she went on to the University of Wisconsin where she was a research assistant in the education department. Due to discrimination against women at the school, she was prevented from pursuing her Ph.D. Instead she earned her Ph.M. in mathematics in 1939.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nUpon receiving her Ph.M. in mathematics, Livesay worked at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs where she worked for Princeton Surveys, calculating statistics regarding the costs of state and local governments. She went to Philadelphia where she was trained in the operation and programming of IBM Punch-Card Accounting Machines (PCAMs). She had an assistant and designed plug-board programs for the device for six months. Livesay then received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study education at the University of Chicago. She worked with Bruno Bettelheim and George Sheviakov on a psychology project.\\nShortly after, in fall 1940, she began assistant teaching at the University of Illinois, where she was promoted to a full-time instructor the following academic year.\\n\\n\\n=== Manhattan Project ===\\n\\nLivesay was brought onto the Manhattan Project by American physicist Joseph Hirschfelder where he initially reached out to her with the opportunity in the fall of 1943. She began work at Los Alamos in February 1944 after receiving her security clearance. Her advanced mathematics degree and training in programming IBM machines made her uniquely qualified. Upon her arrival, Livesay was asked to work for Richard Feynman's theoretical group, working to determine the predicted shock wave that would result from an implosion type bomb. Livesay held a supervisor role on Feynman's team where she oversaw a crew that ran IBM machines 24 hours a day. She also performed hand calculations to check the work of the IBM machine.\\nAlongside Stan Frankel and Eldred Nelson, Livesay developed a program for the PCAMs to solve the set of hydrodynamic equations for implosions in February and March of 1944. She later served as supervisor of the PCAM operators. Livesay recruited mathematician Eleanor Ewing to the project. While at Los Alamos, they both received mathematics lectures from John von Neumann. Livesay, in turn, instructed von Neumann in the use of the IBM machines, information that he later used in the design of ENIAC.\\nAfter the Manhattan Project, Livesay attempted to continue her career in England. She worked to establish a computer link between Harwell and Teddington. Her salary, 30 percent below that of her colleagues, did not sufficiently offset expense of child care and she abandoned her mathematics career. Beginning in 1956, she taught for a year as an assistant professor of science at Columbia College in South Carolina.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nWhile working at Los Alamos, Livesay met experimental nuclear physicist Anthony French.

              "  'In the mathematical field of graph theory, a semi-symmetric graph is an undirected graph that is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive. In other words, a graph is semi-symmetric if each vertex has the same number of incident edges, and there is a symmetry taking any of the graph\\'s edges to any other of its edges, but there is some pair of vertices such that no symmetry maps the first into the second.\\n\\n\\n== Properties ==\\nA semi-symmetric graph must be bipartite, and its automorphism group must act transitively on each of the two vertex sets of the bipartition (in fact, regularity is not required for this property to hold).  For instance, in the diagram of the Folkman graph shown here, green vertices can not be mapped to red ones by any automorphism, but every two vertices of the same color are symmetric with each other.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nSemi-symmetric graphs were first studied E. Dauber, a student of F. Harary, in a paper, no longer available, titled \"On line- but not point-symmetric graphs\".  This was seen by Jon Folkman, whose paper, published in 1967, includes the smallest semi-symmetric graph, now known as the Folkman graph, on 20 vertices.\\nThe term \"semi-symmetric\" was first used by Klin et al. in a paper they published in 1978.\\n\\n\\n== Cubic graphs ==\\nThe smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph (that is, one in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) is the Gray graph on 54 vertices. It was first observed to be semi-symmetric by Bouwer (1968). It was proven to be the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph by Dragan Marušič and Aleksander Malnič.\\nAll the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 10000 vertices are known. According to Conder, Malnič, Marušič and Potočnik, the four smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graphs after the Gray graph are the Iofinova–Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the Ljubljana graph on 112 vertices, a graph on 120 vertices with girth 8 and the Tutte 12-cage.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nWeisstein, Eric W., \"Semisymmetric Graph\", MathWorld',\n",

Paulson began working as a mathematician at JPL in 1948, where she calculated rocket trajectories by hand. She is among the women who made early progress at JPL.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBarbara Jean Lewis was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 11, 1928. She was raised with three siblings \\n(two older sisters and one younger brother), and when she was 12 years old her father died. Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well. In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin.\\nIn 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia. In 1975 they finally settled in Glendora.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nPaulson joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 as a computer, calculating rocket paths and working on the MGM-5 Corporal, the first guided missile designed by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. Paulson and her colleagues were at one point invited to sign their names on the 100th Corporal rocket prior to its transport to the White Sands test range. The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff. On January 31, 1958, Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper. The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal to carry a warhead over 200 miles.\\nIn 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, she and her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant woman on staff would result in insurance policy problems. JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth. Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who had been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab. Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time. At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'.\\nIn the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars. Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target. In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab.\\n\\nIn the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars. Paulson successfully calculated the trajectory the Viking probe needed on its 11-month transit between Earth and Mars. Paulson's calculations also proved to be essential during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase of the mission in which the lander would detach from the spacecraft, enter the martian atmosphere, and parachute down to the surface. In the late 1970s Paulson and her colleagues worked on some of the first interstellar trajectories during the planning of the Voyager missions in which Voyager 1, having launched in September 1977, and as of April 13, 2019 is the most distant from Earth of all human-made objects.\\nPaulson retired from JPL in 1993 and remained in Pasadena until 2003 before moving to Iowa.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nPaulson and her husband Harry had daughters Karen (née Paulson) Bishop and Kathleen (née Paulson) Knutson, four grandchildren (Jonathan, Kyle, Harrison, and Corrine), and several nieces and nephews.  Throughout pregnancy and her eventual return to work at JPL, Barbara's husband at the time was a real estate appraiser and member of the Pasadena Board of Realtors. Fortunately, upon Barbara's return to work Harry was able to adjust his schedule, as did many of the other human computers with children, to ensure that their children were taken care of.\\nBarbara Paulson's husband Harry Murray Paulson died on July 9, 2003, they were married 44 years.

              "  'Beryl May Dent  (10 May 1900 – 9 August 1977) was an English mathematical physicist, technical librarian, and a programmer of early analogue and digital computers to solve electrical engineering problems. She was born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. In 1923, she graduated from the University of Bristol with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\\nShe returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard-Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master\\'s thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.\\nIn 1930, she joined Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company\\'s library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing numerical methods for solving differential equations by the use of the differential analyser that was built for the University of Manchester and Douglas Hartree. She was the first to develop a detailed reduced major axis method for the best fit of a series of data points.\\nLater in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan-Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating semiconducting materials. She joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department. In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to Sompting, West Sussex, and died there in 1977.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nBeryl May was born on (1900-05-10)10 May 1900, at Penley Villa, Park Lane, Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Agnes Dent (1869–1967), née Thornley, and Eustace Edward (1868–1954). She was baptised at St Paul\\'s, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.:\\u200a1\\u200a They had married at St Mary\\'s Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27 July 1898. Her mother was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art. She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers. In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.\\nOn 18 March 1889, Dent\\'s father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board. In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, his elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls\\' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax. In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics\\' Institute. He enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College. In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations. His first teaching post was at Coopers\\' Company Grammar School, Bow, London, before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School.\\nIn October 1901, Dent\\'s father left Chippenham to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster. The family moved to Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century. In April 1907, they moved to 22 Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.:\\u200a264\\u200a He was elected chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922, and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.\\nDent\\'s father was also a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs and the Princess Ju‑Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward. In Princess Ju‑Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the princess, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure. In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night. She also acted in a scene from Tennyson\\'s Princess at the County School\\'s prize giving day on 16 December 1913.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\n\\n\\n=== Warminster County School (1909–1917) ===\\n\\nFrom 1909, Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher. At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne‑Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook. In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the school. In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed. She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916. In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, one of the first two women\\'s colleges in the University of Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.\\n\\n\\n=== University of Bristol (1919–1923) ===\\n\\nIn 1918, Dent joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire. The First World War opened new employment opportunities for women, and RAE was one of the first military establishments to recruit women into engineering, and mathematical and computational research.:\\u200a116\\u200a:\\u200a10\\u200a In the same period that Dent was at RAE, Lorna Swain, then mathematics tutor at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge, worked at the establishment on the problem of aircraft propeller vibration.:\\u200a84\\u200a The Treasury reduced RAE\\'s funding after the end of the war, and consequently, the number of resources and staff available to support research fell significantly.:\\u200a58\\u200a In 1919, she left RAE after being accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol. In June 1920, she passed her intermediate examination in French with supplementary courses in Latin, history, and mathematics.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\nIn the following academic year, Dent joined the honours course in mathematics and took an intermediate examination in physics.:\\u200a1\\u200a After spending the summer of 1921 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course. The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac\\'s previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year. They were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hassé, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge; Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the Bristol University College, soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hassé joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.:\\u200a111\\u200a Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus. Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was \"the best teacher he had ever had.\"\\nDent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\\n\\nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course. Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\\n\\n\\n=== Newnham College, University of Cambridge (1923–1924) ===\\nIn June 1923, Dent graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours. On 7 July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge. On her death in 1922, Lilias Sophia Ashworth Hallett left one thousand pounds each to the University of Bristol and Girton College, University of Cambridge, to found scholarships for women.:\\u200a259,\\u200a261\\u200a The University of Bristol scholarship was open to women graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth £45 at the time (equivalent to £3,200 in 2023). She spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification. Before 1948, the University of Cambridge denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as she left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== High School for Girls, Barnsley (1924–1925) ===\\n\\nDent spent the summer of 1924 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, playing mixed doubles tennis in a tournament organised by the local Women\\'s Unionist Association. In September of the same year, she was appointed an assistant teacher in mathematics at the High School for Girls, in Barnsley, Huddersfield Road, on an annual salary of £250 (equivalent to £18,000 in 2023). Annie Rose Nuttall, the school\\'s head teacher, was a former student at Newnham College. In the early 1920s, women who had studied university level mathematics faced limited employment prospects, as mathematics and engineering professions, other than perhaps school teaching, were dominated by men. Dent resigned her position on 31 August 1925 after being appointed a demonstrator (research assistant) in the Department of Physics at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).:\\u200a107\\u200a\\n\\n\\n=== Department of Physics, University of Bristol (1925–1929) ===\\n\\nIn 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens. From August 1925, John Lennard-Jones, of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, was elected reader in mathematical physics. In March 1927, Lennard‑Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.:\\u200a24\\u200a Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.\\nLennard‑Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals. Dent\\'s thesis for her master\\'s degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard‑Jones, \"Some theoretical determinations of crystal parameters. CXVI\", and with Lennard‑Jones and Sydney Chapman, \"Structure of carbonate crystals\" and \"Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals\". On 28 June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work. In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help. Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\", and with Sydney Chapman, \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage. Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. Lennard‑Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Göttingen. She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: \"The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal\" (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides. In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park, Manchester.:\\u200a14–15\\u200a\\nIn December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the university council. Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1 February 1930. Littleton was later Sir Neville Mott\\'s co-author and research assistant in the physics department.:\\u200a517\\u200a In 1930, Lennard‑Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.\\n\\n\\n=== Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park (1930–1960) ===\\nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well-known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines, and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer. In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new \"technical intelligence\" section.:\\u200a193\\u200a In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the University of Birmingham, and past member of the first standing committee of ASLIB.:\\u200a228\\u200a Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.:\\u200a193\\u200a In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6 January 1930.:\\u200a15\\u200a She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,:\\u200a314\\u200a and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.:\\u200a193\\u200a\\nDent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.:\\u200a204–205\\u200a In 1932, the branch had twenty-six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.:\\u200a412\\u200a Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.:\\u200a301\\u200a By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan-Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications. Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.\\n\\nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\" (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell. In 1937, David Myers, then at the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Oxford, asked Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter to calculate the space charge limitation of secondary current in a triode.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a96\\u200a The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a differential analyser. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a97\\u200a Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in \"The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines\" (1950). She would later analyse the problem of stress distribution in a thick disk based on a method devised by Philip Pollock, for Richard William Bailey, the former director of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical sections of the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.:\\u200a16\\u200a\\nDent was a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government\\'s conference dinner on 22 September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, she was elected to the editing committee of the ASLIB book list. In 1944, she was put in charge of the women working in the research department laboratory at Metropolitan-Vickers, and in 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the new computation section. Her role would bring her into contact with Audrey Stuckes, a materials science researcher in the department, and a graduate of Newnham College, who would later head the physics department at the University of Salford. In 1953, they collaborated on an investigation into the heating effects that occur when a current is passed through a semiconductor that has no barrier layer. Dent suggested methods to solve the equations and computed the numerical integrations. In the following year, she developed the Fourier analysis in \"Regenerative Deflection as a Parametrically Excited Resonance Phenomenon\" (1954), that calculated the optimal radial oscillations to maintain cyclotron resonance in a synchrocyclotron. The causes of axial spreading of the charged particle beam during extraction were also analysed.\\nDent joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Ferranti Mark 1 (Mark 1) computer at the University of Manchester, that demonstrated that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer. Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services. In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor. A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.\\nIn 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed Zeta circuit on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill\\'s paper on constructing a high-power pulse transformer and circuit. The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds (equivalent to £59,000 in 2023), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time. She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.:\\u200a232\\u200a:\\u200a243\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\nIn the 1920s, Dent was living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton. May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House, and Dent returned to Bristol on 22 December 1934 for Staveley\\'s funeral. Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association, and secretary and treasurer of the group of former Clifton Hill House students.:\\u200a1, 9\\u200a She would later write \"I was very sorry indeed to leave Bristol and have many happy memories of my time there. I shall miss living at the [Clifton Hill House] Hall very much.\":\\u200a15\\u200a\\nIn 1926, Dent was elected treasurer of the University of Bristol\\'s Convocation, the university\\'s alumni association. In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the Convocation:\\u200a62\\u200a She later represented the Manchester branch of the association. Around 1926, Dent was appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association. The association\\'s aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University. In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women\\'s International League in October 1928.\\n\\nIn July 1929, in Dent\\'s last year at Bristol, she went on holiday to North Devon with friends that included Gertrude Roxbee, known as \"Rox\", who had graduated with Dent in 1923 with a BSc in botany.:\\u200a12–13\\u200a After moving to Manchester in January 1930, Dent found shared lodgings at 10 Montrose Avenue, West Didsbury, in the same house as Roxbee who, at that time, was a teacher at Whalley Range High School.:\\u200a15, 50\\u200a At weekends, she would ramble to Hebden Bridge, and with Roxbee, learnt to figure skate at the Ice Palace, a former ice rink on Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.:\\u200a54\\u200a\\nIn September 1930, she returned to Bristol for the ninety-eighth conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (British Association), meeting her friends at an alumnae association lunch.:\\u200a93\\u200a In the afternoon of the 4 September 1930, she toured Avonmouth Docks as a conference member,:\\u200a94\\u200a and in the evening, was invited to a reception held by Walter Bryant, the then lord mayor of Bristol, at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.:\\u200a94\\u200a. On the following day, she visited an aircraft manufacturer at Whitchurch Airport and attended a garden party at Wills Hall.:\\u200a94\\u200a On the Monday of the conference, Dent was in the audience to see Paul Dirac present his paper on the proton and the structure of matter.:\\u200a94\\u200a She would later comment::\\u200a94\\u200a\\n\\nI heard a striking paper by Dirac, who was a student with me, who is now a very famous person, as I always knew he would be ... I now go about boasting that I was in the same class!\\nDent\\'s father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King\\'s Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St Matthew\\'s Church, Stretford. She had close links to St Matthew\\'s; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St Matthew\\'s Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.\\n\\n\\n== Later life and death ==\\n\\nIn 1962, Dent and her mother moved from Stretford to 1 Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing. Her mother died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10 April 1967. Dent\\'s sister, Florence Mary, also lived in the house until her death on 13 September 1986(1986-09-13) (aged 84). After a brief period as a teacher at a prep school in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, Florence worked as a secretary for a marine insurance firm attached to Lloyd\\'s of London at 12 Leadenhall Street, commuting into London from Harrow each day.:\\u200a57–59\\u200a\\nBeryl May Dent died at Worthing Hospital on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged 77) after a long period of disablement. The funeral service was held on 12 August 1977 at St Mary\\'s Church, Sompting, followed by cremation. Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the book of remembrance at the crematorium states:\\n\\nBeryl May Dent 1900 – A real Christian loved by all – 1977\\nThere is also a memorial to her at the Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting. The bishop\\'s chair, situated close to the altar, bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:\\n\\nIn loving memory of BERYL DENT 1900 – 1977\\nHer Christian faith is perhaps not unexpected, given her father\\'s work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life. However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nAn archive of Dent\\'s papers, that relate to her life and work in the 1920s in the physics department at the University of Bristol, is held in the Special Collections of the University of Bristol Arts and Social Sciences Library, in Tyndall Avenue, Bristol. Included in that archive is a series of letterbooks, written in the 1930s by members of the Clifton Hill House Old Students\\' Association, that include news and photographs of Dent, her family, and friends.\\n\\n\\n=== Atomic force microscopy ===\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\" and \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface. They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).:\\u200a796–797\\u200a The expression for the potential in vacuum, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          φ\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          (\\n          r\\n          )\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varphi _{0}\\\\left(r\\\\right)}\\n  \\n, at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          e\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle e_{k}}\\n  \\n, and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form::\\u200a797\\u200a\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          r\\n          \\n            ∥\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          {\\n          \\n            x\\n            ,\\n            y\\n          \\n          }\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle r_{\\\\parallel }=\\\\left\\\\{x,y\\\\right\\\\}}\\n  \\n is the lateral vector that fixes the observation point coordinates in the sample plane.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            l\\n            ,\\n            m\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{l,m}}\\n  \\n is the reciprocal lattice vector.\\ns is the number of planes to be calculated inside the crystal; s set to zero would calculate the surface plane.\\nThe expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower planes of the crystal lattice. Lennard‑Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.:\\u200a797\\u200a Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,:\\u200a481\\u200a had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.\\nMichael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in surface and colloid chemistry at Loughborough University of Technology and professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, concurred with Buckley, noting that \"an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal ... is obviously extremely improbable.\" However, they acknowledged that the Lennard‑Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally. Nonetheless, Lennard‑Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.:\\u200a14\\u200a Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and Paul Hansma, has shown that this result has direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.:\\u200a543\\u200a\\n\\n\\n=== Reduced major axis regression ===\\n\\nThe theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.:\\u200a1\\u200a If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by 𝜆, then the reduced major axis method assumes that 𝜆 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of x and y. RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nIn Dent\\'s 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\", she admitted that when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown, \"we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions.\" However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of Gaussian error functions, she contended that this expression may be regarded as \"a function of the unknown quantities\", or the likelihood function of the data distribution.:\\u200a106\\u200a Furthermore, she argued that maximising this function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation,:\\u200a5\\u200a subject to the condition that the points are collinear, will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the centroid and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.:\\u200a106\\u200a\\nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        θ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\theta }\\n  \\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:\\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n are the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          X\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {X} }\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          Y\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Y} }\\n  \\n vectors in a covariance matrix giving the covariance between each pair of x and y variables. The superscript \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        T\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle T}\\n  \\n indicates the transpose of the matrix.\\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for the positive root (or zero) of (2)::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nInspection of (3) shows that as 𝜆 tends to plus infinity, the positive root tends to::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nCorrespondingly, as 𝜆 tends to zero, the root tends to::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nDent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known.:\\u200a1049\\u200a Dent\\'s maximum likelihood estimator is the geometric mean of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          θ\\n          \\n            x\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\theta _{x}}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          θ\\n          \\n            y\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\theta _{y}}\\n  \\n, equivalent to::\\u200a184\\u200a\\n\\nDennis Lindley repeated Dent\\'s analysis and stated that Dent\\'s geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function,:\\u200a235–236,\\u200a241\\u200a and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.:\\u200a15\\u200a Subsequently, Theodore Anderson pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.:\\u200a3\\u200a Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then National Bureau of Standards, responded to Lindley, stating Lindley\\'s own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction. Furthermore, Albert Madansky, late H. G. B. Alexander professor of business administration at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\\n  \\n is negative.:\\u200a201–203\\u200a\\nRichard J. Smith has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in \"A Problem in Least Squares\" (1878) and Charles Kummell in \"Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity\" (1879). It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope, and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.:\\u200a106\\u200a Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.:\\u200a3\\u200a\\n\\n\\n=== Electrical design using digital computers ===\\n\\nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency. On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, \"The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:\\n\\nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the university\\'s library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:\\n\\nThe first problem of calculating the impulse voltage distribution on transformer windings took about five hours of machine time. Conversely, a hand calculation, using a method described by Thomas John Lewis in \"The Transient Behaviour of Ladder Networks of the Type Representing Transformer and Machine Windings\" (1954), took around three months.:\\u200a486\\u200a The use of a computer in the second problem allowed for a more accurate solution as it was possible to include nonlinear magnetic characteristics in the calculation. In the last problem, the torque and speed curves for the synchronous motors were calculated in around fifteen minutes.:\\u200a486\\u200a Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.\\nSignificant research had been devoted to determining a transformer\\'s internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers. It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in \"A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer\" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Selected papers and academic articles ===\\n\\n\\n=== Publications detail ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAdcock, Robert James (March 1878).

In part as fallout from the student protests, in the same year, the Institute of Research in Mathematics Education (IREM) was founded at the university, with André Revuz as its director, and Revuz invited Artigue to become one of its members. Through her involvement with the institute, her interests shifted from logic to mathematics education.\\nArtigue directed IREM from 1985 to 1988. She then moved to the University Institute for Teacher Education of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, where she took a full professorship and became head of the mathematics department. She returned to Paris Diderot University and to the directorship of IREM in 1999, and retired as an emeritus professor in 2010.\\nShe also served as president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 2007 to 2010.\\n\\n\\n== Research ==\\nArtigue\\'s early work in mathematics education focused on derivatives and integrals and on the graphical representation of functions. Later, she became interested in educational technology and its integration into the teaching of mathematics. Her research also included work on pedagogical theory.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nArtigue was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians twice, in 1998 and 2006.\\nIn 2012, her collaborators organized a conference in her honor in Paris, and a festschrift from the conference, The Didactics of Mathematics: Approaches and Issues: A Homage to Michèle Artigue, was published in 2016.\\nArtigue won the Félix Klein medal of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction in 2013. In 2015, the Inter-American Committee on Mathematics Education gave her their Luis Santaló Medal. She became a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 2015.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",

              "  'The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions\\nand functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.\\nA simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat\\'s principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, which depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.\\nMany important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet\\'s principle. Plateau\\'s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical formulation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe calculus of variations may be said to begin with Newton\\'s minimal resistance problem in 1687, followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli (1696). It immediately occupied the attention of Jacob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l\\'Hôpital, but  Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject, beginning in 1733. Lagrange was influenced by Euler\\'s work to contribute significantly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange, Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange\\'s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his 1756 lecture Elementa Calculi Variationum.\\nLegendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject. To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Poisson (1831), Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The 20th and the 23rd Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further development.\\nIn the 20th century David Hilbert, Oskar Bolza, Gilbert Ames Bliss, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.\\n\\n\\n== Extrema ==\\nThe calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps functions to scalars, so functionals have been described as \"functions of functions.\"  Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n of a given function space defined over a given domain.

The extremum \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        J\\n        [\\n        f\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle J[f]}\\n  \\n is called a local maximum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≤\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J\\\\leq 0}\\n  \\n everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f,}\\n  \\n and a local minimum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≥\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J\\\\geq 0}\\n  \\n there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.\\nBoth strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the converse may not hold.  Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema. An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler–Lagrange equation.\\n\\n\\n== Euler–Lagrange equation ==\\n\\nFinding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero).  The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equation.\\nConsider the functional\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n

              "  'Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems; it is the study of ergodicity. In this context, \"statistical properties\" refers to properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.\\nErgodic theory, like probability theory, is based on general notions of measure theory.  Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.\\nA central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set. Systems for which the Poincaré recurrence theorem holds are conservative systems; thus all ergodic systems are conservative.\\nMore precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a time average along each trajectory. For the special class of ergodic systems, this time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time \"forgets\" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as mixing and equidistribution, have also been extensively studied.\\nThe problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.\\nThe concepts of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis are central to applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).\\n\\n\\n== Ergodic transformations ==\\n\\nErgodic theory is often concerned with ergodic transformations.  The intuition behind such transformations, which act on a given set, is that they do a thorough job \"stirring\" the elements of that set. E.g. if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout.  At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.\\nThe formal definition is as follows: \\nLet T : X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ), with μ(X) = 1.  Then T is ergodic if for every E in Σ with μ(T−1(E) Δ E) = 0 (that is, E is invariant), either μ(E) = 0 or μ(E) = 1.\\nThe operator Δ here is the symmetric difference of sets, equivalent to the exclusive-or operation with respect to set membership. The condition that the symmetric difference be measure zero is called being essentially invariant.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\n\\nAn irrational rotation of the circle R/Z, T: x → x + θ, where θ is irrational, is ergodic. This transformation has even stronger properties of unique ergodicity, minimality, and equidistribution. By contrast, if θ = p/q is rational (in lowest terms) then T is periodic, with period q, and thus cannot be ergodic: for any interval I of length a, 0 < a < 1/q, its orbit under T (that is, the union of I, T(I), ..., Tq−1(I), which contains the image of I under any number of applications of T) is a T-invariant mod 0 set that is a union of q intervals of length a, hence it has measure qa strictly between 0 and 1.\\nLet G be a compact abelian group, μ the normalized Haar measure, and T a group automorphism of G. Let G* be the Pontryagin dual group, consisting of the continuous characters of G, and T* be the corresponding adjoint automorphism of G*. The automorphism T is ergodic if and only if the equality (T*)n(χ) = χ is possible only when n = 0 or χ is the trivial character of G. In particular, if G is the n-dimensional torus and the automorphism T is represented by a unimodular matrix A then T is ergodic if and only if no eigenvalue of A is a root of unity.\\nA Bernoulli shift is ergodic. More generally, ergodicity of the shift transformation associated with a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and some more general stationary processes follows from Kolmogorov\\'s zero–one law.\\nErgodicity of a continuous dynamical system means that its trajectories \"spread around\" the phase space. A system with a compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I functionally independent from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville\\'s theorem implies the existence of a finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is complete integrability.\\n\\n\\n== Ergodic theorems ==\\nLet T: X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and suppose ƒ is a μ-integrable function, i.e. ƒ ∈ L1(μ).

But if the transformation is ergodic, and the measure is invariant, then the time average is equal to the space average almost everywhere. This is the celebrated ergodic theorem, in an abstract form due to George David Birkhoff.  (Actually, Birkhoff\\'s paper considers not the abstract general case but only the case of dynamical systems arising from differential equations on a smooth manifold.) The equidistribution theorem is a special case of the ergodic theorem, dealing specifically with the distribution of probabilities on the unit interval.\\nMore precisely, the pointwise or strong ergodic theorem states that the limit in the definition of the time average of ƒ exists for almost every x and that the (almost everywhere defined) limit function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n is integrable:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∈\\n        \\n          L\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        μ\\n        )\\n        .\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\in L^{1}(\\\\mu ).\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nFurthermore, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n is T-invariant, that is to say\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∘\\n        T\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\circ T={\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nholds almost everywhere, and if μ(X) is finite, then the normalization is the same:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∫\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        =\\n        ∫\\n        f\\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\int {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,d\\\\mu =\\\\int f\\\\,d\\\\mu .}\\n  \\n\\nIn particular, if T is ergodic, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n must be a constant (almost everywhere), and so one has that\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\bar {f}}={\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nalmost everywhere.

The ergodic theorem then asserts that the average behavior of a function ƒ over sufficiently large time-scales is approximated by the orthogonal component of ƒ which is time-invariant.\\nIn another form of the mean ergodic theorem, let Ut be a strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators on H.  Then the operator\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∫\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          U\\n          \\n            t\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        t\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {1}{T}}\\\\int _{0}^{T}U_{t}\\\\,dt}\\n  \\n\\nconverges in the strong operator topology as T → ∞. In fact, this result also extends to the case of strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of contractive operators on a reflexive space.\\nRemark: Some intuition for the mean ergodic theorem can be developed by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which we think of as U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, it makes sense that the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the  limit just described).\\n\\n\\n== Convergence of the ergodic means in the Lp norms ==\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be as above a probability space with a measure preserving transformation T, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The conditional expectation with respect to the sub-σ-algebra ΣT of the T-invariant sets is a linear projector ET of norm 1 of the Banach space Lp(X, Σ, μ) onto its closed subspace Lp(X, ΣT, μ). The latter may also be characterized as the space of all T-invariant Lp-functions on X. The ergodic means, as linear operators on Lp(X, Σ, μ) also have unit operator norm; and, as a simple consequence of the Birkhoff–Khinchin theorem, converge to the projector ET in the strong operator topology of Lp if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and in the weak operator topology if p = ∞. More is true if 1 < p ≤ ∞ then the Wiener–Yoshida–Kakutani ergodic dominated convergence theorem states that the ergodic means of ƒ ∈ Lp are dominated in Lp; however, if ƒ ∈ L1, the ergodic means may fail to be equidominated in Lp. Finally, if ƒ is assumed to be in the Zygmund class, that is |ƒ| log+(|ƒ|) is integrable, then the ergodic means are even dominated in L1.\\n\\n\\n== Sojourn time ==\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space such that μ(X) is finite and nonzero. The time spent in a measurable set A is called the sojourn time.  An immediate consequence of the ergodic theorem is that, in an ergodic system, the relative measure of A is equal to the mean sojourn time:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              A\\n              )\\n            \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∫\\n        \\n          χ\\n          \\n            A\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        =\\n        \\n          lim\\n          \\n            n\\n            →\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            k\\n            =\\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n            −\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          χ\\n          \\n            A\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        \\n          T\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n        x\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {\\\\mu (A)}{\\\\mu (X)}}={\\\\frac {1}{\\\\mu (X)}}\\\\int \\\\chi _{A}\\\\,d\\\\mu =\\\\lim _{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty }\\\\;{\\\\frac {1}{n}}\\\\sum _{k=0}^{n-1}\\\\chi _{A}(T^{k}x)}\\n  \\n\\nfor all x except for a set of measure zero, where χA is the indicator function of A.\\nThe occurrence times of a measurable set A is defined as the set k1, k2, k3, ..., of times k such that Tk(x) is in A, sorted in increasing order. The differences between consecutive occurrence times Ri = ki − ki−1 are called the recurrence times of A. Another consequence of the ergodic theorem is that the average recurrence time of A is inversely proportional to the measure of A, assuming that the initial point x is in A, so that k0 = 0.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                R\\n                \\n                  1\\n                \\n              \\n              +\\n              ⋯\\n              +\\n              \\n                R\\n                \\n                  n\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        →\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              A\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          (almost surely)\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {R_{1}+\\\\cdots +R_{n}}{n}}\\\\rightarrow {\\\\frac {\\\\mu (X)}{\\\\mu (A)}}\\\\quad {\\\\text{(almost surely)}}}\\n  \\n\\n(See almost surely.)

The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on SL(2, R) was described in 1952 by S. V. Fomin and I. M. Gelfand. The article on Anosov flows provides an example of ergodic flows on SL(2, R) and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature.  Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the hyperbolic space by the action of a lattice in the semisimple Lie group SO(n,1). Ergodicity of the geodesic flow on Riemannian symmetric spaces was demonstrated by F. I. Mautner in 1957. In 1967 D. V. Anosov and Ya. G. Sinai proved ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative sectional curvature. A simple criterion for the ergodicity of a homogeneous flow on a homogeneous space of a semisimple Lie group was given by Calvin C. Moore in 1966.  Many of the theorems and results from this area of study are typical of rigidity theory.\\nIn the 1930s G. A. Hedlund proved that the horocycle flow on a compact hyperbolic surface is minimal and ergodic. Unique ergodicity of the flow was established by Hillel Furstenberg in 1972. Ratner\\'s theorems provide a major generalization of ergodicity for unipotent flows on the homogeneous spaces of the form Γ \\\\ G, where G is a Lie group and Γ is a lattice in G.\\nIn the last 20 years, there have been many works trying to find a measure-classification theorem similar to Ratner\\'s theorems but for diagonalizable actions, motivated by conjectures of Furstenberg and Margulis. An important partial result (solving those conjectures with an extra assumption of positive entropy) was proved by Elon Lindenstrauss, and he was awarded the Fields medal in 2010 for this result.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nChaos theory\\nErgodic hypothesis\\nErgodic process\\nKruskal principle\\nLindy effect\\nLyapunov time – the time limit to the predictability of the system\\nMaximal ergodic theorem\\nOrnstein isomorphism theorem\\nStatistical mechanics\\nSymbolic dynamics\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Historical references ==\\nBirkhoff, George David (1931), \"Proof of the ergodic theorem\", Proc.

Then she went on to a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where she first met fellow mathematician Arthur Harold Stone. They married in April 1942.\\nStone and Maharam both lectured at various universities in the US and the United Kingdom, including Northeastern University and University of Manchester,  and were faculty at the University of Rochester for many years. She was an invited speaker at a measure theory conference at Northern Illinois University in 1980. Their two children, David and Ellen, both became mathematicians as well.\\nShe retired in 2001. Her husband, Arthur Stone, died August 6, 2000, and her son, David Stone, died August 27, 2014. She died a month later in Brookline, Massachusetts and was buried at Kehillath Jacob Cemetery in  West Roxbury.\\n\\n\\n== Contributions ==\\nMaharam pioneered the research of finitely additive measures on integers. Maharam's theorem about the decomposability of  complete measure spaces plays an important role in the theory of Banach spaces. Maharam published it in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1942.  Another paper of Maharam, in 1947 in the Annals of Mathematics, introduced Maharam algebras, which are complete Boolean algebras with continuous submeasures.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nMaharam was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1976.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",

She is a professor of mathematics at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, and Lord Chair in Mathematics and Computer Science at Southwestern.\\n\\n\\n== Education and career ==\\nFutamura is originally from Japan, and emigrated with her family to Kentucky when she was five years old. She grew up in an artistic family, and despite a talent for mathematics preferred creating art in various mediums. She entered the University of Louisville intending to study art there, but switched to mathematics after taking linear algebra in her sophomore year, discovering the beauty in mathematical proofs, and becoming convinced by faculty mentor Steven Seif that mathematics could be viewed as a form of art.\\nShe met her future husband, YouTube mathematics tutor Patrick Jones, when they were both mathematics students at the University of Louisville. After Futamura graduated summa cum laude in 2002, with a senior thesis on graphical methods in geometry supervised by Robert Powers, she and Jones both entered graduate study at Vanderbilt University. Jones dropped out of the graduate program to become a full-time mathematics tutor, but Futamura continued, earning a master\\'s degree and completing her Ph.D. in 2007. Her dissertation, Symmetrically Localized Frames, Localized Operators and Their Application to the Construction of Localized Hilbert and Banach Frames, was supervised by Akram Aldroubi, and involved the theory of frames in linear algebra.\\nIn order to continue her work combining mathematics with the creative arts, Futamura decided to teach mathematics at a liberal arts college rather than go into industry or take a research university position. She joined the Southwestern University faculty as an assistant professor in 2007, was tenured as an associate professor in 2013, and became a full professor in 2018. In the same year she became department chair.\\n\\n\\n== Writing and recognition ==\\nFutamura won the Carl B. Allendoerfer Award of the Mathematical Association of America in 2018, with Southwestern student Robert Lehr, for their 2017 article \"A New Perspective on Finding the Viewpoint\".\\nShe is the coauthor of the book Perspective and Projective Geometry, with Annalisa Crannell and Marc Frantz, published by Princeton University Press in 2019.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nHome page',\n",
              "  'Erika Pannwitz (May 26, 1904 in Hohenlychen, Germany – November 25, 1975 in Berlin) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometric topology. During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office (German: Auswärtiges Amt) colloquially known as Pers Z S. After the war, she became editor-in-chief of Zentralblatt MATH.\\n\\n\\n== Education and thesis ==\\nErika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor School in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922.  She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and Göttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt. Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\\n\\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem posed to her through completely independent investigations; she has achieved this goal through the appropriate choice of new terms, through understanding and deep insight into the difficult material presented to her, through the mastery of older methods and their novel use, and has thus demonstrated her scientific maturity in this, her first dissertation.\\nSince, in my opinion, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective achievement in it exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the work submitted by Miss Pannwitz as a dissertation with the rating \"eximium\".\\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\\n\\nI certainly agree with Mr Hopf\\'s vote. Topology is one of the most promising but at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still in its infancy, so that any valuable result can only be achieved with a high degree of strong inventiveness. Through the present work, topology has been enriched by a series of extraordinarily beautiful theorems\\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.  The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.\\n\\n\\n== Later career ==\\nIn September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik. This was due to the difficulty of women achieving an academic career in the 1930\\'s, who found their career path blocked into higher education. It was also due to Pannwitz along with many other German mathematicians not wanting to provide support to the Nazis, despite her excellent dissertion. From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort.  After Germany\\'s defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt für Mathematik, and after the death of its previous editor-in-chief, Hermann Ludwig Schmid, in 1956, she became editor-in-chief.  Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin.  East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964.  From 1964 until her retirement in 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.\\nAlthough Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position. The reasons for this are unknown, but there could have been some element of discrimination, perhaps due to her gender or politics or both.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nEine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten., Math.

She is co-director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet). She organized and directs the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC). Kopell received her B.A. from Cornell University in 1963 and her Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1967. She held visiting positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France (1970), MIT (1975, 1976–1977), and the California Institute of Technology (1976).\\nThe focus of her research is the field of applied biomathematics and includes use of mathematical models to analyze the physiological mechanisms of brain dynamics. The techniques Kopell uses include extensions of invariant manifold theory, averaging theory, and geometric methods for singularly perturbed equations. From the peak of her career in 1990, she has contributed to over 200 published research articles in the field of biomathematics. Her current interests include topics such as: how does the brain produce its dynamics (physiological mechanisms), how do brain rhythms take part in cognition (sensory processing, attention, memory, motor control), and how can pathologies of brain dynamics help to understand symptoms of neurological diseases (Parkinson\\'s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy) as well as altered states of consciousness (anesthesia). She collaborates widely with experimentalists and clinicians in order to conduct research on these topics.\\nKopell is a 1990 MacArthur Fellow.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nKopell was born on November 8, 1942, and grew up on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. Her father was an accountant and her mother and older sister also majored in mathematics.\\nAs a child, she had a severe eye problem which taught her how to cope with being \"different.\" This ability to cope would help her successfully deal with feelings of marginalization she would later experience as a female scientist. She attributes her professional success to this ability as well as the support she received from mentors throughout her career. Her high school teachers encouraged her to go into the mathematics field.\\nDuring her undergraduate education at Cornell University, she registered for a mathematics honors program, and was the only female participant. Kopell graduated from Cornell with an A.B. in 1963.\\nShe then decided to attend graduate school in order to \"find an alternative to the more traditional life her family expected for her.\" Kopell originally applied to programs on the East Coast and was admitted to all of them except for one; however, after being encouraged by another student, she chose to attend school on the West Coast instead. She was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, with a fellowship and graduated with an M.A. and a Ph.D. in 1967. At Berkeley, she did well on her exams and was known as the \"bright female.\" However, she struggled in the early stages of her dissertation work and switched supervisors to Stephen Smale. Smale suggested a problem which Kopell almost singlehandedly solved, leading to her thesis in the field of dynamical systems which catapulted her career.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic career ===\\nAfter completing her graduate education, Kopell accepted an instructorship at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she met collaborator Lou Howard, with whom she published several articles. She later met her husband, Gabriel Stolzenberg, at Northeastern University.\\nWhile Kopell did her thesis work in theoretical mathematics, she later switched to applied mathematics.\\nIn 1969, she joined Northeastern University as faculty, becoming a full professor in 1978. In 1986, she became a professor of mathematics at Boston University and in 2009 she became the first woman at Boston University to be named a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor. She was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1990 for her work developing methods of dynamical systems to attack problems of applied mathematics. She is currently Director and Co-Founder of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, which consists of a group of over two dozen labs, mostly in the Boston Area, working on brain dynamics and their cognitive implications. She is also Co-Director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet).\\nKopell is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

              "  'Marie-Sophie Germain (French: [maʁi sɔfi ʒɛʁmɛ̃]; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father\\'s library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life. Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred. On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Family ===\\n\\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the National Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.\\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain\\'s nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline\\'s son, published some of Germain\\'s work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).\\n\\n\\n=== Introduction to mathematics ===\\nWhen Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father\\'s library. Here she found J. E. Montucla\\'s L\\'Histoire des Mathématiques, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.\\nGermain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father\\'s library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d\\'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.\\nGermain\\'s parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.\\n\\n\\n=== École Polytechnique ===\\n\\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the École Polytechnique opened. As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\". The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\". Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc, \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman, and he became her mentor.\\n\\n\\n== Early work in number theory ==\\n\\n\\n=== Correspondence with Legendre ===\\nGermain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published Essai sur la théorie des nombres. After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain\\'s work in the Supplément to his second edition of the Théorie des Nombres, where he calls it très ingénieuse (\"very ingenious\"). See also Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem below.\\n\\n\\n=== Correspondence with Gauss ===\\nGermain\\'s interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss\\' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. Le Blanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss\\' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain\\'s work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n = p − 1, where p is a prime number of the form p = 8k + 7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss\\' reply did not comment on Germain\\'s proof.\\nAround 1807 (sources differ), during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss\\' safety.  General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie\\'s name.\\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.  He replied:\\n\\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M. Le Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory\\'s] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\\n\\nGauss\\' letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere. In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x^{n}+y^{n}}\\n  \\n is of the form \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          h\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        n\\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h^{2}+nf^{2}}\\n  \\n, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        +\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x+y}\\n  \\n is also of that form.

Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased. Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.\\n\\n\\n== Work in elasticity ==\\n\\n\\n=== Germain\\'s first attempt for the Academy Prize ===\\n\\nWhen Germain\\'s correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni\\'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange\\'s comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant, and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.\\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research. She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\". Lagrange was able to use Germain\\'s work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".\\n\\n\\n=== Subsequent attempts for the Prize ===\\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help. Germain\\'s anonymous 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals, and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\". The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson. In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain\\'s help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the academy commission, had had access to her work).\\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"Recherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques\", under her own name, and on 8 January 1816 she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award. Although Germain had at last been awarded the prix extraordinaire, the academy was still not fully satisfied. Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff–Love equation), but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler, which led to incorrect boundary conditions. Here is Germain\\'s final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          N\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          (\\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            2\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          )\\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                ∂\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              z\\n            \\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                t\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        0\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N^{2}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial x^{4}}}+2{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial x^{2}\\\\partial y^{2}}}+{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial y^{4}}}\\\\right)+{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}z}{\\\\partial t^{2}}}=0,}\\n  \\n\\nwhere N2 is a constant.\\nAfter winning the academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the academy\\'s tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.\\n\\n\\n=== Later work in elasticity ===\\n\\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.\\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.\\nOne further work of Germain\\'s on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces\". She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).\\n\\n\\n== Later work in number theory ==\\n\\n\\n=== Renewed interest ===\\nGermain\\'s best work was in number theory, and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. It reawakened Germain\\'s interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.\\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain\\'s letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.\\n\\n\\n=== Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem ===\\n\\nFermat\\'s Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers p that do not divide any of x, y, or z. Case 2 includes all p that divide at least one of x, y, or z. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"Sophie Germain\\'s theorem\":\\n\\nLet p be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime P = 2Np + 1 (N is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\\nif xp + yp + zp ≡ 0 (mod P), then P divides xyz, and\\np is not a p-th power residue (mod P).\\nThen the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem holds true for p.\\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes p < 100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent p < 197\". L. E. Dickson later used Germain\\'s theorem to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.\\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled Remarque sur l\\'impossibilité de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l\\'équation xp + yp = zp, Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat\\'s theorem for p > 5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\", around 40 digits long.  Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre\\'s treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for p = 5 (see Correspondence with Legendre).  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later. Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\", but ultimately her method did not work.\\n\\n\\n== Work in philosophy ==\\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology. She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.\\nTwo of her philosophical works, Pensées diverses and Considérations générales sur l\\'état des sciences et des lettres, aux différentes époques de leur culture, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.  Pensées is a history of science and mathematics with Germain\\'s commentary. In Considérations, the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the humanities.\\n\\n\\n== Final years ==\\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain, she continued to work. In 1831 Crelle\\'s Journal published her paper on the curvature of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding y and z in \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                4\\n                (\\n                \\n                  x\\n                  \\n                    p\\n                  \\n                \\n                −\\n                1\\n                )\\n              \\n              \\n                x\\n                −\\n                1\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ±\\n        p\\n        \\n          z\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\tfrac {4(x^{p}-1)}{x-1}}=y^{2}\\\\pm pz^{2}}\\n  \\n\". Mary Gray records: \"She also published in Annales de chimie et de physique an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\" On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.\\nDespite Germain\\'s intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"rentière – annuitant\" (property holder), not a \"mathématicienne\". But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of Göttingen in 1837—six years after Germain\\'s death—Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".\\n\\n\\n== Honors ==\\n\\n\\n=== Memorials ===\\n\\nGermain\\'s resting place in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone.  At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died.

Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\". Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans\\' 1913 book Woman in Science, although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\". Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".\\nGermain\\'s contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss).\\n\\n\\n=== Modern assessments ===\\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain\\'s work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\" Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"\\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain\\'s theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain\\'s work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\" Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel Tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain\\'s name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower\\'s construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"\\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the Disquisitiones, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\" Gray adds on to say \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\" Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain\\'s creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\", and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches. Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain\\'s biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"\\n\\n\\n== Germain in popular culture ==\\nGermain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn\\'s 2001 play Proof. The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden\\'s film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\\nIn the fictional work \"The Last Theorem\" by Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl, Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve Fermat\\'s Last Theorem.\\nA musical about Sophie Germain\\'s life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Sophie Germain Prize ==\\nThe Sophie Germain Prize (French: Prix Sophie Germain), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the Academy of Sciences in Paris. Its purpose is to honour a French mathematician for research in the foundations of mathematics. This award, in the amount of €8,000, was established in 2003, under the auspices of the Institut de France.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nProof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for specific exponents\\nSophie Germain Counter Mode\\nSophie Germain prime\\nSophie Germain Prize\\nSophie Germain\\'s theorem\\nTimeline of women in science\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\nBell, Eric Temple (1937).

              "  'Lesley Millman Sibner (August 13, 1934 – September 11, 2013)  was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Polytechnic Institute of New York University. She earned her Bachelors at City College CUNY in Mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Courant Institute NYU in 1964 under the joint supervision of Lipman Bers and Cathleen Morawetz.  Her thesis concerned partial differential equations of mixed-type.\\n\\n\\n== Research career ==\\nIn 1964, Lesley Sibner became an instructor at Stanford University for two years. She was a Fulbright Scholar at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris the following year.  At this time, in addition to solo work on the Tricomi equation and compressible flows, she began working with her husband Robert Sibner on a problem suggested by Lipman Bers: do there exists compressible flows on a Riemann surface?  As part of her work in this direction, she studied differential geometry and Hodge theory eventually proving a nonlinear Hodge–DeRham theorem with Robert Sibner based on a physical interpretation of one-dimensional harmonic forms on closed manifolds. The techniques are related to her prior work on compressible flows.  They kept working together on related problems and applications of this important work for many years.\\nIn 1967 she joined the faculty at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York.  In 1969 she proved the Morse index theorem for degenerate elliptic operators by extending classical Sturm–Liouville theory.\\nIn 1971-1972 she spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study where she met Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott. She realized she could use her knowledge of analysis to solve geometric problems related to the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem.  In 1974, \\nLesley and Robert Sibner produced a constructive proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\\nKaren Uhlenbeck suggested that Lesley Sibner work on Yang-Mills equation.  In 1979-1980 she visited Harvard University where she learned gauge field theory from Clifford Taubes. This lead results about point singularities in the Yang-Mills equation and the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations.  Her interest in singularities soon brought her deeper into geometry, leading to a classification of singular connections and to a condition for removing two-dimensional singularities in work with Robert Sibner.\\nRealizing that instantons could under certain circumstances be viewed as monopoles, the Sibners and Uhlenbeck constructed non-minimal unstable critical points of the Yang-Mills functional over the four-sphere in 1989.  She was invited to present this work at the Geometry Festival. She was a Bunting Scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 1991. For the subsequent decades, Lesley Sibner focussed on gauge theory and gravitational instantons.  Although the research sounds very physical, in fact throughout her career, Lesley Sibner applied physical intuition to prove important geometric and topological theorems.\\nIn 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\\n\\n\\n== Selected articles ==\\nSibner, L.

              "  'Michèle Audin (Algiers, 3 January, 1954) is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the University of Geneva, the University of Paris-Saclay and most recently at the University of Strasbourg, where she performed research notably in the area of symplectic geometry.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nMichéle Audin is the daughter of mathematician Maurice Audin and mathematics teacher Josette Audin, both pied-noirs and political activists for the independence of Algeria. While she was a child, her father died under torture in June 1957 in Algeria, after being arrested by General Jacques Massu\\'s paratroopers.\\nShe studied at the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles (now merged into the École Normale Supérieure but at the time a separate institution) and then she earned a Ph.D. degree in 1986 from the University of Paris-Saclay, with a thesis written under the supervision of François Latour, entitled Cobordismes d\\'immersions lagrangiennes et legendriens [Cobordisms of Lagrangian and Legendrian immersions].\\nShe then became a professor at the Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) of the Université de Strasbourg from 1987 until her early retirement in 2014. She was president of the association Femmes et mathématiques in 1990 and 1991.\\nIn 2009 she refused to receive the Legion of Honour, on the grounds that the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father. Finally in September 2018, French president Emmanuel Macron admitted that Maurice Audin was tortured to death and apologized on behalf of France.\\nIn 2013 she was awarded the Prix Ève Delacroix for her novel Une vie brève.\\n\\n\\n== Research ==\\nMichèle Audin\\'s research work mainly belongs to the field of symplectic geometry. Her PhD thesis draws on René Thom\\'s theory of cobordism to contribute to the founding program of symplectic topology launched by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold. Audin then oriented her research to dynamical aspects, and more specifically to Hamiltonian systems.\\nIn her monograph \"Spinning tops: A Course on Integrable Systems\", Audin discusses in detail the question of whether a dynamical system is integrable, a central question of her later research. A particularly enlightening example comes from her article \"Sur la réduction symplectique appliquée à la non-intégrabilité du problème du satellite\".\\nAudin\\'s work on Kovalevskaya top led her to write another book, both mathematical, historical and more personal on this mathematician: \"Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya\". She also published the correspondence (1928-1991) of two members of the Bourbaki group, the mathematicians Henri Cartan and André Weil, she wrote the first biography of the mathematician Jacques Feldbau, and she documented the genesis of the modern holomorphic dynamics, with detailed portraits of the main protagonists: Pierre Fatou, Gaston Julia and Paul Montel.\\nShe contributes regularly on historical subjects to the mathematics popularisation website Images des mathématiques.\\n\\n\\n== As a writer ==\\nAlongside her activity as a mathematician, Audin leads an intense literary activity on her own and, since 2009, within the Oulipo.\\n\\n\\n=== History of the Paris Commune ===\\nPassionate about the insurrection of the Paris Commune of 1871, Audin has written five books on this topic to document its history as well as its memory: two novels published by Gallimard, Comme une rivière bleue (2017) and Josée Meunier, 19 rue des Juifs (2021), as well as three historical books published by Libertalia. The first, Eugène Varlin, bookbinding worker 1839-1871 (2019), is an anthology of the various writings of Eugène Varlin, some of which have not been published since their original release. The second, C\\'est la nuit surtout que le combat devient furieux (2020), publishes the correspondence between Alix Payen, an unknown paramedic, and her Fourierist family, during the few months of the Parisian insurrection. The last, La Semaine sanglante: Mai 1871. Légendes et comptes (2021), proposes a new counting of the deaths of Bloody Week, going up to “certainly 15,000 dead”.\\n\\n\\n=== Activity within the Oulipo ===\\nAudin was guest of honor at a meeting of Oulipo on the initiative of Jacques Roubaud, following the publication of her book Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya, which mixes in a discontinuous form anecdotes, precise mathematics, testimonials, excerpts of correspondence with commentary and even literary pastiches. There are references to the Oulipo in testimonial chapters entitled “Je me souviens” in reference to Georges Perec, or even in a pastiche of Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino.\\nShe became part of Oulipo in 2009, as the first member to be both a mathematician and a writer. Mathematics is for her both a source of inspiration for the constraints she invents and a recurring theme in her literary work. For example, in her novel La formule de Stokes, the heroine is a mathematical formula.\\nShe invented constraints of a geometric nature such as Pascal\\'s or Désargues\\' constraint. Pascal\\'s constraint was experienced in her online story Mai Quai Conti which evokes the history of the Académie des sciences during the Paris Commune: the relationships between the characters of the story are determined by the position of the points of a geometric figure illustrating Pascal\\'s theorem.\\nShe also worked with Ian Monk on nonine, i.e. a variant of the sestina based on numbers which are not Queneau numbers, and therefore with which the system of permutation of the sestina does not work.\\nHer first novel, Cent vingt et un jours, is based on an onzine, i.e. a quenine of order 11 (variant of the sestina) from which characters, literary references and other elements of the narrative permute in a regulated manner. As in the poetic sestina, the last word of a chapter is the same as the first word of the next chapter. \\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Literature ===\\n(in French) La formule de Stokes, roman, Cassini, 2016.\\n(in French) Mademoiselle Haas, Gallimard, 2016.\\n(in French) Cent vingt et un jours, Gallimard, 2014.

She was the first woman to be appointed to an Oxford fellowship in mathematics.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nIda Busbridge born to Percival George Busbridge and May Edith Webb on 10 February 1908.  She was the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was 8 months old of complications from influenza. This left her mother, a primary school teacher, to care for the children.\\nBusbridge started her schooling at 6 in a school in her mother's district.  She moved schools to Christ's Hospital in 1918, having won a scholarship at the age of ten. Here she received a firm grounding in mathematics from Miss Mitchener. Busbridge became head girl of the school and was later described as the most brilliant pupil in its 400-year history.\\nIn 1926 she enrolled in Royal Holloway College, London, intending to specialise in physics, but switched to mathematics in 1928. She turned down a place at Newnham College Cambridge as the scholarship to Royal Holloway was significantly more generous. During her schooling she was involved in the Choral Society and University Choir along with the Science Discussion Society.\\nBusbridge graduated in 1929 with first class honours and was the awarded the Sir John Lubbock Prize for best first class honours of all London University Colleges.  She continued her education at Royal Holloway, earning a masters with distinction in mathematics in 1933.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nShe began teaching as a demonstrator in mathematics at University College, London in 1933.\\nShe moved to St Hugh's College Oxford in 1935 to teach mathematics alongside Dorothy Wrinch to undergraduates of five women's colleges.  Influenced by Madge Adam and Harry Plaskett, she shifted her interest to applications of maths in astronomy and physics.\\nDuring the Second World War, her workload increased to take on the education of physicists and engineers at Oxford. Her workload was especially great - not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service - but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.  She was appointed to a Fellowship of St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1946 – the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.\\nIn 1962, she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by Oxford. She was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\\nShe was president of the Mathematical Association for 1964.\\nBusbridge's work included integral equations and radiative transfer. She was highly regarded as a lecturer and tutor, attending to her students' educational and personal needs. She retired from Oxford in 1970, and became one of the early tutors and developers of courses at the Open University, teaching Lebesgue integration and tutoring complex analysis.\\nIda Busbridge died on 27 December 1988. A funeral service was held on 9 January 1989 in the church in Keston, where her ashes were later interred, and a memorial service was held at St Hugh's College Oxford on 25 February 1989. The principal, Rachel Trickett, quoted Dorothy Wrinch in describing Ida Busbridge as ‘quite simply the best woman mathematician I’ve ever met: brilliant and yet so capable and unassuming’.\\n\\n\\n== Commemoration ==\\nIn 1983, a former student made a donation of £280,000 to endow the Ida Busbridge fellowship in mathematics at St Hugh's.\\nIda Busbridge's biography was published by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on 13 August 2020 as part of their collection of biographies of astronomers and mathematicians.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nFriedman, E.

              "  'Helena Rasiowa (20 June 1917 – 9 August 1994) was a Polish mathematician. She worked in the foundations of mathematics and algebraic logic.\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\nRasiowa was born in Vienna on 20 June 1917 to Polish parents. As soon as Poland regained its independence in 1918, the family settled in Warsaw. Helena\\'s father was a  railway specialist. She exhibited many different skills and interests, from music to business management and the most important of her interests, mathematics.\\nIn 1938, the time was not very opportune for entering a university. Rasiowa had to interrupt her studies, as no legal education was possible in Poland after 1939. Many people fled the country, or at least they fled the big towns, which were subject to German bombardment and terror. The Rasiowa family fled also, as most high-ranking administration officials and members of the government were being evacuated to Romania. The family spent a year in Lviv. After the Soviet invasion in September 1939, the town was taken over by the Soviet Union. The lives of many Poles became endangered, so Helena\\'s father decided to return to Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n== Academic development ==\\nRasiowa became strongly influenced by Polish logicians. She wrote her Master\\'s thesis under the supervision of Jan Łukasiewicz and Bolesław Sobociński. In 1944, the Warsaw Uprising broke out and consequently Warsaw was almost completely destroyed. This was not only due to the immediate fighting, but also because of the systematic destruction which followed the uprising after it had been suppressed. Rasiowa\\'s thesis burned with the whole house. She herself survived with her mother in a cellar covered by the ruins of the demolished building.\\nAfter the war, Polish mathematics began to recover its institutions, its moods, and its people. Those who remained considered their duty to be the reconstruction of Polish universities and the scientific community. One of the important conditions for this reconstruction was to gather all those who could participate in re-creating mathematics. In the meantime, Rasiowa had accepted a teaching position in a secondary school. That is where she met Andrzej Mostowski and came back to the university. She re-wrote her Master\\'s thesis in 1945 and in the next year she started her academic career as an assistant at the University of Warsaw, the institution she remained linked with for the rest of her life.\\nAt the university, she prepared and defended her PhD thesis, Algebraic Treatment of the Functional Calculi of Lewis and Heyting, in 1950 under the guidance of Prof. Andrzej Mostowski. This thesis on algebraic logic initiated her career contributing to the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic: In 1956, she took her second academic degree, doktor nauk (equivalent to habilitation today) in the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where between 1954 and 1957, she held a post of associate professor, becoming a professor in 1957 and subsequently Full Professor in 1967. For the degree, she submitted two papers, Algebraic Models of Axiomatic Theories and Constructive Theories, which together formed a thesis named Algebraic Models of Elementary Theories and their Applications.\\nRasiowa was pivotal in her role for inviting many international mathematicians, especially logicians, to Poland in the late \\'70s and early \\'80s, despite the country\\'s instability at the time. According to Japanese mathematician Hiroakira Ono, she enabled collaboration through her iron will.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n1963: (with Roman Sikorski) The Mathematics of Metamathematics\\n1974: An Algebraic Approach to Non-Classical Logics\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nHelena Rasiowa at the Mathematics Genealogy Project\\n\"Helena Rasiowa\", Biographies of Women Mathematicians, Agnes Scott College\\nO\\'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"Helena Rasiowa\", MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive, University of St Andrews\\nJosep Maria Font (1996) On the contributions of Helena Rasiowa to mathematical logic via IEEE Xplore\\nZbigniew Ras Photos of Helena Rasiowa with coworkers and students',\n",

              "  'Lisa Marie Piccirillo (born 1990 or 1991) is an American mathematician who works on Geometry and low-dimensional topology. In 2020, Piccirillo published a mathematical proof in the journal Annals of Mathematics determining that the Conway knot is not a slice knot, answering an unsolved problem in knot theory first proposed over fifty years prior by English mathematician John Horton Conway. In July 2020, she became an assistant professor of mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nPiccirillo was raised in Greenwood, Maine, and attended Telstar Regional High School in Bethel, Maine. Her mother was a middle school math teacher. As a child, she had many hobbies, such as riding dressage, being involved in her church\\'s youth group, and participating in drama and band in school.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nPiccirillo earned a B.S. in mathematics from Boston College in 2013 and a PhD in low-dimensional topology at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of John Luecke in 2019, followed by postdoctoral research at Brandeis University. Boston College professor Elisenda Grigsby cited Piccirillo\\'s creativity as contributing to her success, adding that Piccirillo did not fit the mold of a \"standard golden child math prodigy\" during her undergraduate studies.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nThe Conway knot was named after its discoverer, English mathematician John Horton Conway, who first wrote about the knot in 1970. The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however, the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice (whether or not it was a slice of a higher dimensional knot), eluded mathematicians for half a century, making it a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory. This changed with Lisa Piccirillo\\'s work on the Conway knot, which completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified.\\n\\nPiccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry. She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time to \"see what\\'s so hard about this problem\" before finding an answer: I think the next day, which was a Sunday, I just started trying to run the approach for fun and I worked on it a bit in the evenings just to try to see what\\'s supposed to be hard about this problem.Before the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is not “slice”. A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon (mathematician), a professor at UT Austin (a senior topologist), and casually mentioned her solution. In her interview with Quanta Magazine, she described her interaction with Gordon in the following way:And then the following week, I had a meeting with Cameron Gordon, a senior topologist in my department, about something else, and I mentioned it to him there. He was like, \"Oh really? You showed that the Conway knot is not slice?\". Like, show me. And then I started to put it up and he started asking kind of detailed questions, and then at some point he got, he got very excited.Lisa Piccirillo, in the same interview, has mentioned that the fact that this problem was still unsolved was \"completely ridiculous\". As she put it:   Well, I just thought it was completely ridiculous that we didn\\'t know whether this knot was slice or not. We had a lot of tools to do this sort of thing, so I didn\\'t understand like, why for some 11-crossing-knot this would be so difficult. \\nShe followed this statement up with this: It was quite surprising to me. I mean, it\\'s just one knot. In general, when mathematicians prove things, we like to prove really broad, general statements: All objects like this have some property. And I proved like, one knot has a thing. I don\\'t care about knots. So, I do care about three and four dimensional spaces, though. And it turns out that, when you want to study three and four dimensional spaces, you find yourself studying knots anyway.  The Washington Post reported that her proof had been \"hailed as a thing of mathematical beauty, and her work could point to new ways to understand knots.\"\\nFollowing the publication of Piccirillo\\'s proof in Annals of Mathematics, she was offered a tenure-track position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn association with the 2021 Breakthrough Prizes, Piccirillo was awarded one of three 2021 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes, for early-career achievements by a woman mathematician. The other two winners were Nina Holden and Urmila Mahadev. She was also awarded a 2021 Clay Research Fellowship for \"her work in low-dimensional topology\" and a 2021 Sloan Research Fellowship.\\nShe was also counted as one of \"The world\\'s top 50 thinkers for the Covid-19 age\" by UK magazine Prospect.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial site',\n",

              " 'Contemporary_artists': ['Allan Kaprow (August 23, 1927 – April 5, 2006) was an American performance artist, installation artist, painter, and assemblagist .  He helped to develop the \"Environment\" and \"Happening\" in the late 1950s and 1960s, as well as their theory. His Happenings — some 200 of them — evolved over the years. Eventually Kaprow shifted his practice into what he called \"Activities\", intimately scaled pieces for one or several players, devoted to the study of normal human activity in a way congruent to ordinary life. Fluxus, performance art, and installation art were, in turn, influenced by his work.\\n\\n\\n== Academic career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Studies ===\\nBecause of a chronic illness Kaprow was forced to move from New York to Tucson, Arizona. He began his early education in Tucson where he attended boarding school.\\nLater he would attend the High School of Music and Art in New York where his fellow students were the artists Wolf Kahn, Rachel Rosenthal and the future New York gallerist Virginia Zabriskie.\\nAs an undergraduate at New York University, Kaprow was influenced by John Dewey\\'s book Art as Experience. He studied in the arts and philosophy as a graduate student. He received his MA degree from Columbia University in art history. He started in the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts in 1947. It was here that he started with a style of action painting, which greatly influenced his Happenings pieces in years to come. He went on to study composition with John Cage in his class at the New School for Social Research, painting with Hans Hofmann, and art history with Meyer Schapiro. Kaprow started his studio career as a painter, and later co-founded the Hansa and Reuben Galleries in New York and became the director of the Judson Gallery. With John Cage\\'s influence, he became less and less focused on the product of painting, and instead on the action.\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\nKaprow began teaching at Rutgers University in 1953. While there, he helped to create what will eventually become one branch of the Fluxus group, along with professors Robert Watts, Geoffrey Hendricks and Roy Lichtenstein, artists George Brecht and George Segal, and undergraduates Lucas Samaras and Robert Whitman. Through a long teaching career, he taught at Rutgers until 1961, Pratt Institute from 1960 to 1961, the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1961 to 1966, and the California Institute of the Arts from 1966 to 1974, before serving as a full-time faculty member at the University of California, San Diego, where he taught from 1974 to 1993.\\n\\n\\n== Happenings ==\\nIn 1958, Kaprow published the essay \"The Legacy of Jackson Pollock\".  In it he demands a \"concrete art\" made of everyday materials such as \"paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies.\" In this particular text, he uses the term \"happening\" for the first time stating that craftsmanship and permanence should be forgotten and perishable materials should be used in art.\\nThe \"Happenings\" first started as tightly scripted events, in which the audience and performers followed cues to experience the art. To Kaprow, a Happening was \"A game, an adventure, a number of activities engaged in by participants for the sake of playing.\" Furthermore, Kaprow says that the Happenings were \"events that, put simply, happen.\" There was no structured beginning, middle, or end, and there was no distinction or hierarchy between artist and viewer. It was the viewer\\'s reaction that decided the art piece, making each Happening a unique experience that cannot be replicated. It is participatory and interactive, with the goal of tearing down the wall a.k.a. \"the fourth wall\" between artist and observers, so observers are not just \"reading\" the piece, but also interacting with it, becoming part of the art.\\nOne such work, titled Eighteen Happenings in Six Parts, involved an audience moving together to experience elements such as a band playing toy instruments, a woman squeezing an orange, and painters painting.  His work evolved, and became less scripted and incorporated more everyday activities. Another example of a Happening he created involved bringing people into a room containing a large abundance of ice cubes, which they had to touch, causing them to melt and bringing the piece full circle.\\nKaprow\\'s most famous happenings began around 1961 to 1962, when he would take students or friends out to a specific site to perform a small action. He gained significant attention in September 1962 for his Words performance at the Smolin Gallery. However, the ritualistic nature of his happenings is nowhere better illustrated than in Eat (1964), which took place in a cave with irregular floors criss-crossed with puddles and streams. As Canadian playwright Gary Botting described it, \"The \\'visitors\\' entered through an old door, and walked down a dark, narrow corridor and up steps to a platform illuminated by an ordinary light bulb. Girls offered red and white wine to each visitor. Apples and bunches of bananas dangled from the ceiling and a girl fried banana fritters on a hotplate. In a small cave, entered only by climbing a ladder, a performer cut, salted and distributed boiled potatoes. In a log hut, bread and jam were served. Bread was stuffed between the logs. The visitors could eat and drink at random for an hour. There was no dialogue other than that used in the interaction of the visitors with the performers.\" Botting noted that Eat appealed to all the senses and superadded to that was the rhythmic, repeated ticking of metronomes set at the pace of a human heartbeat, simulating ritualistic drumming. Furthermore, \"The \\'visitors\\' were involved physically (by being required to walk, eat, drink, etc.), mentally (by being required to follow directions), emotionally (by the darkness and strangeness of the interior of the cave), and mystically (by the \\'mystery\\' of what is beyond the walls of the hut or in the inner cave.\"  In short, Kaprow developed techniques to prompt a creative response from the audience, encouraging audience members to make their own connections between ideas and events. In his own words, \"And the work itself, the action, the kind of participation, was as remote from anything artistic as the site was.\" He rarely recorded his Happenings which made them a one time occurrence.\\nAt the 1971 International Design Conference at Aspen, Kaprow directed a happening called \"Tag\" on the Aspen Highlands ski lift which focused on one of the conference themes: \"the technological revolution\". Using five video cameras and monitors, he recorded people riding the ski lift and again as they watched themselves riding the ski lift on the monitors.\\nKaprow\\'s work attempts to integrate art and life. Through Happenings, the separation between life, art, artist, and audience becomes blurred.  The \"Happening\" allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells.  One of his earliest \"Happenings\" was the \"Happenings in the New York Scene,\" written in 1961 as the form was developing.  Kaprow calls them unconventional theater pieces, even if they are rejected by \"devotees\" of theater because of their visual arts origins. These \"Happenings\" use disposable elements like cardboard or cans making it cheaper on Kaprow to be able to change up his art piece every time. The minute those elements break down, he can get more disposable materials together and produce another improvisational master piece. He points out that their presentations in lofts, stores, and basements widens the concept of theater by destroying the barrier between audience and play and \"demonstrating the organic connection between art and its environment.\" [1] There have been recreations of his pieces, such as \"Overflow\", a tribute to the original 1967 \"FLUIDS\" Happening.\\nIn 1973 Allan Kaprow performed with Jannis Kounellis, Wolf Vostell, Robert Filliou, and Mario Merz in Berlin at the ADA - Aktionen der Avantgarde.\\nIn 2014 This Is Not A Theatre Company restaged two of Allan Kaprow\\'s Happenings in New York City as part of the exhibit \"Allen Kaprow. Other Ways\" at the Fundacio Antoni Tapies in Barcelona: Toothbrushing Piece (\"performed privately with friends\"), and Pose (\"Carrying chairs through the city. Sitting down here and there. Photographed. Pix left on the spot. Going on\").\\nHe published extensively and was Professor Emeritus in the Visual Arts Department of the University of California, San Diego. Kaprow is also known for the idea of \"un-art\", found in his essays [2] \"Art Which Can\\'t Be Art\" and \"The Education of the Un-Artist.\"\\nMany well-known artists, for example, Claes Oldenburg, cite him as an influence on their work.\\n\\n\\n== Published works ==\\nAssemblage, Environments and Happenings (1966) presented the work of like-minded artists through both photographs and critical essays, and is a standard text in the field of performance art. Kaprow\\'s Essays on the Blurring of Art and Life (1993), a collection of pieces written over four decades, has made his theories about the practice of art in the present day available to a new generation of artists and critics.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Yard (1961) sixth in his list of the greatest performance art works, writing, \"His first happenings engaged the audience in overwhelming, often playful ways. Yard is perhaps the most significant of these early works\".\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nFluxus\\nInstallation art\\nGutai group\\nTenth street galleries\\nDada\\nPerformance Art\\nImprov Everywhere\\nNew Media Art\\nFluxus at Rutgers University\\nExhibition 2014: Allan Kaprow.

              "  'Slobodan \"Braco\" Dimitrijević (born 18 June 1948) is a Bosnian conceptual artist. His works deal mainly with history and the individual\\'s place in it. He lives and works in Paris, France.\\nHe has exhibited internationally since the 1970s, including at the Tate Gallery in 1985. He has participated in documenta (1972, 1977 and 1992) and the Venice Biennale (1976, 1982, 1990, 1993 and 2009). His works are held in the collection of the Tate Gallery, MoMA Museum of Modern Art New York, and that of the Centre Pompidou, among others.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and work ==\\nBraco Dimitrijević was born on 18 June 1948 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia. His father was the painter Vojo Dimitrijević, one of the most famous modern artists in Yugoslavia. He started painting at the age of 5 and was featured in a TV show entitled Filmske Novosti (Film News) in 1957. His first conceptual work dates back to 1963.\\nHe went on to study at Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, from which he graduated in 1971. He then studied at Saint Martin\\'s School of Art in London from 1971 to 1973.\\nIn 1976, he wrote Tractatus Post Historicus, which formed the theoretical basis of his early work.\\n\\n\\n== Casual Passers-by ==\\nIn the 1970s, Dimitrijevic gained attention when he began his Casual Passer-by series. The work features very big close-up photographic portraits of everyday people that were hung on buildings and billboard in different cities in Europe and America. He then went on to produce memorial plaques in honour of other people that he met. About the one he made for the Lucio Amelio\\'s \"Terrae Motus\" collection he said: \"I Stopped the first man i saw in the street, explained to him what my work was and then asked him to be the model for the foto\".\\n\\n\\n== Animals ==\\nHis work from the 1980s which joined animals and works of art would go on to become an exhibition in 1998 at the Paris Zoo that was visited by over a million people.\\n\\n\\n== New work ==\\nHis Triptychos Post Historicus installations feature paintings by old or modern masters in conjunction with everyday objects and fruits/vegetables. More than 500 of these installations exist. Controversy arose when a man who visited the exhibition at the Tate realized that the paintings in question were not copies but the originals and reported this to The Times who then wrote about it.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of painters from Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBraco Dimitrijević\\nGalerie TORRI\\nartfacts entry Archived 2017-09-21 at the Wayback Machine\\n(in French) Louvre is my studio, street is my museum',\n",
              "  'Félix González-Torres or Felix Gonzalez-Torres (November 26, 1957 – January 9, 1996) was a Cuban-born American visual artist. He lived and worked primarily in New York City between 1979 and 1995 after attending university in Puerto Rico. González-Torres’s practice incorporates a minimalist visual vocabulary and certain artworks that are composed of everyday materials such as strings of light bulbs, paired wall clocks, stacks of paper, and individually wrapped candies. González-Torres is known for having made significant contributions to the field of conceptual art in the 1980s and 1990s. His practice continues to influence and be influenced by present-day cultural discourses. González-Torres died in Miami in 1996 from AIDS-related illness.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nGonzález-Torres was trained as a photographer and his oeuvre incorporates this medium in varying ways. He is well known for works that transform commonplace materials into installations that foster meaningful responses from audiences, as well as works with which audiences can choose to physically interact, and works that may be manifested anew and can change each time they are exhibited. González-Torres stated “the only thing permanent is change,” always questioning the stability of the art object.\\nThroughout much of González-Torres\\'s practices, he purposefully incorporated dissonant information and formats. Examples of these contradictions include the way he structured courses as a professor, wrote press releases and texts, gave lectures, participated in interviews, and created varying strategies for each body of work. One particular example is the way Gonzalez-Torres structured a lecture on the occasion of a solo-exhibition of his work at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago in 1994. Following a slide show of various artworks and exhibitions in which his work was included, Gonzalez-Torres proceeded to read a prepared statement reflecting on the current national deficit, government budget allocations for public housing versus military spending, incarceration and poverty rates, and inequitable wealth distribution. He closed the lecture with a quote from a New York Times article that establishes a legacy of contention around the separation of church and state. This methodology was intended to foster individuals’ right and responsibility to have their own point of view.\\nOver time the work has been interpreted through varying critical lenses, including: the subjective construction of histories, questions of monumentality and attachment to permanency; the profoundness of love and partnership, codes and resilience of queer love; the role of ownership; perceptions of value and authority; discourse around death, loss, and the potentiality of renewal; questions of display and conditions of reception, notions of disidentification; the role and subversiveness of beauty; the rewards and consequences of generosity; arbitrary delineations between private and public selves/places; social, political, and personal dimensions of the AIDS epidemic; questions of established economic and political structures; occupation of the margins and infiltration of centers of power; the instability of language and what is connoted vs. denoted; somatic responses/forms of knowledge; etc. At the core of so many of the artist’s works is the physical experience of the works and their capacity to be manifest in perpetually changing circumstances. \\nGonzalez-Torres stated that his work requires an audience, following Bertolt Brecht’s theory of Epic Theatre. This is a theory that means an audience member is primed to have an individualized response to a performance that leads them to effect change in the world. Gonzalez-Torres maintained that his work should always remain open to new and changing interpretations. While Gonzalez-Torres’s work is conceptual, the formal qualities of the work are especially powerful in their ability to elicit individualized emotional responses from each viewer. “My work is about the daily dealing with events, and objects that form, transform, and affect my positioning.”\\n\\n\\n=== Categories and bodies of work ===\\nCategories and Bodies of Work most often reflect the way that Gonzalez-Torres commonly referred to works in his lifetime. Certain works may fit into more than one category/body of work. Some bodies of work by González-Torres\\'s are accompanied by Certificates of Authenticity and Ownership. The certificate includes information about the parameters for installing or exhibiting the work, the conceptual nature of the work, as well as the owner\\'s integral role in the artwork.\\n\\n\\n==== Billboards ====\\nThe billboard works date from 1989 to 1995. The billboard works consist of specific images or texts that are installed at billboard scale. It is essential to 14 of the 17 billboard works that they must be installed in multiple, diverse, public/outdoor sets of locations (ideally 24 locations at a time). Documentation of each billboard location is an essential aspect of these works.\\n\\n\\n==== Birds in sky ====\\nThe ‘birds in sky’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Images of birds in the sky are featured across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice, including billboards, doubles, framed photographs, paper stack, pedestals/platforms, and puzzles.\\n\\n\\n==== Candy works ====\\nThe ‘candy works’ date from 1990 to 1993. The dimensions for the majority of the candy works include an “ideal weight.” (In total there are 20 candy works. Fifteen of the candy works have ideal ‘weights’, four of these ‘ideal weights’ may correlate to an average body weight of an adult male, and three may correlate to a combined average body weight of two adult men.) The medium for each candy work includes “endless supply” as well as “dimensions vary with installation.” When candies are present in a manifestation of a candy work, it is integral that viewers must be permitted to choose to take individual pieces of candy from the work. The candies may or may not be replenished at any time. Candy works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. Each of the candy works are unique.\\n\\n\\n==== Curtains ====\\nThe ‘curtain’ works date from 1989 to 1995. The fabric curtain work is intended to be installed on existing windows as standard curtains would typically appear. There are five beaded curtain works, each with a specific bead pattern, and one fabric curtain work. Beaded curtain works must be installed in locations where individuals would naturally have the choice to pass through them and the work’s dimensions vary with installation. Curtain works can exist in more than one place at a time.\\n\\n\\n==== Doubles ====\\nThe ‘doubles’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Doubled objects, images, and motifs feature across the majority of the bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Framed photographs ====\\nThe framed photographic works date from 1986 to 1995. The artist considered the frame to be an essential element of these works. This is one of many bodies of Gonzalez-Torres’s works that incorporate photographic methodologies. Many of the artist’s framed photographs were purposefully analog, developed and processed by hand, as opposed to other photographic works by Gonzalez-Torres which emphasized mechanical reproducibility and the overt removal of the artist’s hand.\\n\\n\\n==== Graphs ====\\nThe ‘graph’ works date from 1988 to 1994. With the exception of one photograph, the ‘graph’ works are the only works that have hand drawn elements. The ‘graph’ works consist of both painting and drawings. While some of these works have been contextualized as representations of individuals’ medical charts, the graph works are intentionally non-specific and are also referential to other graphed data.\\n\\n\\n==== Image transfers ====\\nThe ‘image transfers’ date from 1987 to 1992. All three of these works are made in editions. Two of these works are intended to be permanently installed directly on the wall and the third is intended to be permanently tattooed.\\n\\n\\n==== Light strings ====\\nThe ‘light string’ works date from 1992 to 1994. The light strings were produced by an electrician in conversation with the artist and consist of commonplace electrical components. Each light string work can only exist in one place at a time; which is in contrast to Gonzalez-Torres’s manifestable works that are also made of commonplace materials. The dimensions of a light string work vary with each installation; the exhibitor’s choice of configuration for each installation completes the work. There are 24 individual light string works; 22 are unique and two are editioned works. The light strings works are intended to be displayed either with all the bulbs on or all the bulbs off; light bulbs are replaced promptly as necessary. The relative brightness of the lightbulbs for each light string work is specified but the actual brightness may vary from one installation to the next.\\n\\n\\n==== Mirrors ====\\nThere are four individual mirror works dating from 1992 to 1994. Three of these works consist of mirrors of a specific size that are either hung on or embedded in the wall. One of the mirror works consists of a mirrored box that is displayed on the ground.\\n\\n\\n==== Multiples ====\\nThe category of multiples represents those works made in edition sizes ranging from six to unlimited. There are 18 individual multiples in various mediums, dating from 1987 to 1995. Many of the works in this category purposefully resemble unique works, questioning notions of value and the power of the language of categorization.\\n\\n\\n==== Newspaper and magazine clippings ====\\nImagery sourced from ‘newspaper and magazine clippings’ features across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice including paper stacks, puzzles, framed works and paintings. These works include images and texts that pertain to politics, violence, consumerism, mass culture, and religion. Images of crowds are especially prominent in this category of works, and this motif carries its own diverse scope of meanings in the artist’s work. \\n\\n\\n==== Paintings ====\\nThe ‘paintings’ date from 1992 to 1994. There are 15 individual paintings, and each of the works is unique. Five of the works are circular canvases painted black with circular newspaper/magazine clippings of crowd imagery adhered to the canvases. Seven of the paintings are graph works. Nine of the painting works include multiple components of the same or similar sizes and shapes.\\n\\n\\n==== Paper stacks ====\\nThe ‘paper stacks’ date from 1988 to 1993. The paper stack works consist of a stack (or stacks) of paper. It is integral to the manifestable paper stack works that individuals must be permitted to choose to take individual sheets of paper from the work. Each paper stack work has a specific text, design, image, and/or paper color that is integral to the work. There are 45 individual paper stack works; three of the paper stack works are static (the sheets are not intended to be replenished) and four of the paper stack works have additional installation elements. The sheets used to manifest a paper stack work may or may not be replenished at any time. Manifestable paper stack works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. There are 42 unique paper stack works; four were made in an edition.\\n\\n\\n==== Pedestals / platforms ====\\nThe ‘pedestals/platforms’ date from 1987 to 1992. There are seven individual pedestal/platform works, and each is unique. Two early sculpture works were presented on platforms, the first of the paper stack works includes a platform, one puzzle is presented on a platform, the one video work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice includes a platform. Two works consist of platforms, one work that includes an optional performer and one of the mirror works. Strategies that identify and question the significance of modes of presentation for artworks can be traced throughout the artist’s practice.\\n\\n\\n==== Photostats ====\\nThe ‘photostats’ date from 1987 to 1992. The photostats were made in small edition sizes ranging from one to four, typically with a single artist’s proof. The photostats consist of lines of white text reproduced on a solid black background. Each of the photostats are framed in simple black metal frames and the glazing reflects the viewer in the work. There are thirteen individual photostats. (These works have sometimes been referred to as ‘date pieces.’)\\n\\n\\n==== Portraits ====\\nThe portrait works date from 1989 to 1994. The portrait works consist of a horizontal line (or lines) of textual entries installed directly on the wall just below the point where the wall meets the ceiling. It is essential to the portrait works that the owner has the right to change the content of the portrait at any time, which may include: adding, subtracting, editing and sequencing entries. Portrait works can exist in more than one place at a time and dimensions vary with installation. The typeface of the text for portrait works is Trump Medieval Bold Italic. The color of the text, and in some cases the optional band of background color, is specified for each work.\\n\\n\\n==== Puzzles ====\\nThe 59 puzzle works date from 1987 to 1992. In the process of making these works, Gonzalez-Torres sent snapshots to commercial photo labs that produced novelty items, such as puzzles, from personal photos. The imagery for the puzzle works ranges from photographs of Gonzalez-Torres’s personal life to re-photographed newspaper/magazine clippings. Most consist of one individual puzzle, although four works consist of multiple components. Most puzzle works are made in editions of three with one AP (55 puzzles). There are three unique puzzle works. Those puzzles that were made in an edition may not have been produced at the same time or by the same commercial photo lab; which resulted in variations in cropping and color tone within the same edition. This body of work illustrates Gonzalez-Torres’s interest in varying modes of photographic reproduction, the effects of commercial production processes on the form of the works, and his utilization of commonplace consumer products in his practice. The puzzles were received from the photo lab fully assembled with a piece of cardboard backing and sealed inside a fitted plastic bag. For the majority of the puzzle works (56 puzzles), the artist considered the plastic bags to be an important part of the works and he described a specific method of installation using map pins (originally pushed through and eventually positioned against the plastic bags). For owner’s who requested to frame these works, the artist provided a separate methodology for framing.\\n\\n\\n===== Dateline installations =====\\n\\nAcross several bodies of work, starting as early as 1987, González-Torres employed a strategy, described by some as a “dateline,” wherein he included lists of various events/dates in a purposeful but non-chronological order. The lists included the names of social and political figures and references to cultural phenomena or world events, many of which had political and cultural historical significance. In the body of photostat works, the events/dates are printed in white type on black sheets of photographic paper presented in basic frames with reflective glazing. The viewer’s reflection was visible when reading the line of text. These lists of seeming non sequiturs prompted viewers to consider the relationships and gaps between the diverse references as well the construction of individual and collective identities and memories. González-Torres also employed this strategy for the portraits, as in \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Jennifer Flay) (1993), which includes, \"A New Dress 1971 Vote for Women, NZ 1893 JFK 1963\" as well as for the billboards, as in “Untitled” (1989), which includes, “People With AIDS Coalition 1985 Police Harassment 1969 Oscar Wilde 1895.”\\n\\n\\n=== Various Installations and Interpretations ===\\n\\nAll of González-Torres\\'s works, with few exceptions, are titled \"Untitled\" in quotation marks, sometimes followed by a parenthetical portion of the title. This was an intentional titling scheme by the artist. Rather than limiting the artworks by ascribing any singular title, the artist titled his works in this way to allow for open-ended interpretations to unfold over time. In a 1991 interview with Robert Nickas, González-Torres reflected on the titles of his artworks: “things are suggested or alluded to discreetly. The work is untitled because “meaning” is always shifting in time and place.”\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s manifestable works incorporate the process of change. A 1991 installation of \"Untitled\" (Placebo), a candy work, consisted of a carpet (roughly 20 x 30 feet) of shiny silver wrapped candies. The candies covered the floor from one side of the room to the other and extended all the way to the back wall opposite the visitor. In 2011, the same candy work, \"Untitled\" (Placebo), was installed at the Museum of Modern Art in two large rectangles divided by a walkway for visitors. A borrower/exhibitor may choose to install the work in any configuration and can also choose to use amounts of candies that differ from the \"ideal weight\". Like other candy pieces in his oeuvre, this work has an \"ideal weight\" that remains constant while the actual weight of the installed candy may fluctuate during the course of an exhibition and also from one exhibition to the next.  \\nIn 1989 González-Torres presented \"Untitled\" (Memorial Day Weekend) and \"Untitled\" (Veterans Day Sale), exhibited together as \"Untitled\" (Monuments): block-like stacks of paper printed with ambiguous content, from which the viewer is allowed to choose to take a sheet. Rather than constituting a solid, immovable monument, the stacks can be dispersed, depleted, and renewed over time. \\nAt Roni Horn\\'s 1990 solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, González-Torres encountered her sculpture \"Forms from the Gold Field\" (1980–82). González-Torres later wrote about his experience of Horn\\'s work in \"1990: L.A., The Gold Field.\" which was first published in Horn\\'s catalogue \"Roni Horn. Earths Grow Thick.\" González-Torres and Horn became acquaintances in the early 1990s, and he later created \"Untitled\" (Placebo – Landscape – for Roni) (1993). \\n\\nOne of his most recognizable works, \"Untitled\" (1991), a billboard work which features a black-and-white photograph of an unmade bed, was installed in twenty-four outdoor public locations all over New York City in 1992. Viewers would come upon the work unexpectedly while walking the streets in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Manhattan. The billboards were installed in the same manner, scale, and location as existing commercial advertising billboards. The installation, Projects 34: Felix Gonzalez-Torres, was curated and organized by Anne Umland in her role as Curatorial Assistant at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The work is dated 1991, the same year as the death of his long-time partner, Ross Laycock, from AIDS-related illness.  \\n\"Untitled\" (It\\'s Just a Matter of Time) is a billboard originally exhibited in 1992 in Hamburg, reading \"Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit.\" Whereas the general phrase It\\'s Just a Matter of Time remains constant from one installation to the next, the language the phrase is presented in may change depending on the local languages where the work is being installed.\\nIn 1993, González-Torres mounted two simultaneous gallery exhibitions in Paris entitled Travel #1 (at Galerie Ghislaine Hussenot) and Travel #2 at Galerie Jennifer Flay.\\n\\nIn addition to his manifestable “candy works” and “paper stacks”, González-Torres created other malleable works referred to as \"light strings\", which consist of generally lower-wattage/dimmer light bulbs on extension cords, installed however the exhibitor chooses; eg. hung on the wall, piled on floor, strung across a doorway, etc. The body of light strings includes fifteen physically identical light strings, each has 42 light bulbs in white porcelain light sockets, the works are differentiated only by their parenthetical titles and the types of display/installation chosen by each work\\'s owner on an ongoing basis, as well as the display/installation that authorized borrowers chose in the context of loans. Each sculpture can be arranged in any way a particular installer wishes, and thus holds the potential for unlimited variations. Over the course of any given installation, some of the bulbs may burn out but the parameters of the work specify that they have to be replaced.\\nIn 1991 González-Torres began producing sculptures consisting of strands of plastic beads strung on metal rods, which some have interpreted to include references to the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.\\n\\n\\n=== Legacy ===\\nIn May 2002, the Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation was created. The Foundation \"maintains, builds, and facilitates knowledge and understanding around the work of Gonzalez-Torres.\" The Foundation fields exhibition requests that include Felix Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work or respond to the artist\\'s practice in some way and offers ongoing guidance and support for these exhibitions. The Foundation maintains extensive exhibition and image archives and makes them accessible to anyone interested in learning about Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. The Foundation also facilitates publication projects and licenses copyright in Gonzalez-Torres\\'s work. \\nThe Foundation assisted the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in the organization of the Felix González-Torres Community Art Project, a three-year initiative that sponsors visits of internationally renowned contemporary artists to the campus of the school. The Foundation initiated and funded the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Felix González-Torres Travel Grant Program, a five-year initiative that funds travel based projects for CalArts students.\\nSince 1990, González-Torres\\' work has been represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery, which exhibited his work both before and after his death. Starting in 2017, the estate of Felix Gonzalez-Torres has been co-represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery and David Zwirner gallery, New York.\\nIn the second decade of the 21st century the critical legacy of González-Torres\\' work has continued to be expanded and challenged. In 2010 Artforum published an article by artist and critic Joe Scanlan titled \"The Uses of Disorder\" that took a darker look at the soft power and neoliberal economics at play in González-Torres\\' work. In 2017 there was public outcry over the fact that David Zwirner Gallery mounted an extensive exhibition of González-Torres\\' work but made no mention of the role that AIDS played in the works\\' conceptual formation, either in the exhibition proper or its press release.\\n\\n\\n=== Art market ===\\nGonzález-Torres\\'s candy work \"Untitled\" (Portrait of Marcel Brient) (1992) sold for $4.6 million at Phillips de Pury & Company in 2010, a record for the artist at auction at the time. In November 2015 González-Torres\\'s \"Untitled\" (L.A.) (1991), a 50 lb. installation of green hard candies, sold for $7.7 million at Christie\\'s, New York, a new record at the time. In 2024 his light-string work \"Untitled\" (America #3) (1992) sold for $13.6 million, also at Christie\\'s, a new record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and education ==\\nIn January 1970, González-Torres fled Cuba for Madrid, Spain when he was 12 with his older sister. Later that same year, he relocated to Puerto Rico.\\nGonzález-Torres attended the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan from 1975-1979. He moved to New York on academic scholarship to study photography at Pratt Institute in 1979, attending the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1981 and 1983. He received a BFA in photography from Pratt Institute in 1983 and obtained an MFA from the International Center of Photography and New York University in 1987.\\nHe was an adjunct Art Instructor at New York University, New York from 1987-1989 and in 1992. In 1990, Gonzalez-Torres lived in Los Angeles and taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Gonzalez-Torres was a member of Group Material from 1987-1994. In 1992 González-Torres was granted a DAAD fellowship to work in Berlin, and in 1993 a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\\nHe became an American citizen by applying for naturalization as a refugee and he chose to refer to himself as American. His name has appeared as Félix González; professionally, he chose to style his name as Felix Gonzalez-Torres and also as Félix González-Torres in languages that include diacritics.\\nThe artist met his long-term partner Ross Laycock in 1983 in New York. González-Torres and Laycock were in a relationship from 1983 – 1991; for the majority of their relationship they lived in different cities except for a period when they lived together in Los Angeles in 1990. In January 1991, Laycock died of AIDS-related causes in Toronto. Félix González\\'s partner towards the end of his life was Rafael Vasquez.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\nGonzález-Torres staged many solo exhibitions, installations, and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally during his lifetime. His notable solo shows include Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1988), New Museum, New York; Untitled: An Installation by Félix González-Torres as part of the Visual Aids Program (1989-1990), Brooklyn Museum, New York; Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1993), Magasin III Museum for Contemporary Art, Stockholm; Felix Gonzalez-Torres: Traveling (1994), originating at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1995-1996), originating at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, exhibited as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (A Possible Landscape) at Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and as Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Girlfriend in a Coma) at Musée d\\'Art Moderne de Paris.\\nThe artist also participated in numerous group shows during his lifetime, including the Whitney Biennial (1991); the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); and the Biennale of Sydney (1996).\\n\\n\\n=== Selected posthumous exhibitions ===\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1997) ====\\nImmediately following the artist\\'s death in 1996, the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, organized a career retrospective of his work, in conjunction with the publication of a two-volume catalogue raisonné covering nearly all of the artist\\'s output.\\n\\n\\n==== U.S. Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) ====\\n\\nIn 2007, González-Torres was selected as the United States\\' official representative at the Venice Biennale, curated by Nancy Spector. The artist\\'s previously controversial status influenced the 1995 decision to reject him for the Venice pavilion in favor of Bill Viola. His posthumous show (the only other posthumous representative from the United States was Robert Smithson in 1982) at the U.S. Pavilion featured, among others, \"Untitled\" (1992–1995).\\n\\n\\n==== Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form (2010–2011) ====\\nBetween 2010 and 2011, a traveling retrospective, Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form, was shown at Wiels Contemporary Art Centre in Brussels, the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, and the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt. At each of the stages of the exhibition tour, the show was initially installed by the exhibition\\'s curator Elena Filipovic and, halfway through its duration, is completely reinstalled by a different selected artist whose own practice has been influenced by González-Torres. Artists Carol Bove, Danh Vo, and Tino Sehgal were chosen to curate the show\\'s second half.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation (2021) ====\\nIn 2021, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art presented Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation. The exhibition was curated by Tanya Barson.\\n\\n\\n==== Felix Gonzalez-Torres (2023) ====\\nIn 2023, David Zwirner Gallery in New York staged its second posthumous solo exhibition of work by González-Torres, including two works that had never been executed as the artist envisioned. The first, \"Untitled\" (Sagitario) (1994-1995), is a variant of the double pools of water the artist had sketched before his death: two large pools of water were embedded in the gallery floor directly adjacent to one another. This work had first been executed posthumously as two outdoor pools embedded in the ground at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, in 2001 in conjunction with the group exhibition No es sólo lo que ves: pervirtiendo el minimalismo, but the artist had originally envisioned the pools to be installed indoors. The second newly exhibited work, \"Untitled\" (1994-1995), consists of a series of indoor billboard installations that the artist had originally designed for his unrealized exhibition at the Musée d\\'Art Contemporain in Bordeaux.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n1988 Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Cintas Foundation Fellowship Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant Artist Fellowship, Art Matters, Inc.\\n1989 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n1991 Gordon Matta-Clark Foundation Award\\n1992 Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst Fellowship (DAAD) Artists-in-Residence Program, Berlin\\n1993 Artist Fellowship, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAult, Julie, and Andrea Rosen.

              "  'Tomasz Urbanowicz (born 1959 in Wrocław, Poland) is an architect and a designer of architectural glass art.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nTomasz Urbanowicz graduated at the Faculty of Architecture of the Wrocław University of Technology (1978–85). He took glass-window studies at the Fine Arts Academy of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland (1982–85) and worked as an assistant in the Painting and Sculpture Establishment at the Architecture Department of Wrocław Institute. In 1987, together with his wife, architect Beata Urbanowicz, he established his own studio, Archiglass, focused on creating architectural glass art. In 2016, Tomasz Urbanowicz was awarded the Honorable Graduate Award by Wrocław University of Technology.\\nHis glassworks were featured in \\'Colours of Architecture\\' by Andrew Moor (London, 2006), \\'Contemporary Kiln-formed Glass\\' by Keith Cummings ( London / Philadelphia 2009) and \\'Szkło we Współczesnej Architekturze\\' by Ewa Wala.\\nUrbanowicz\\'s artworks took part in World Fairs EXPO three times representing Poland; at EXPO 2000 in Hanover, Germany - as part of the presentation of Lower Silesia; at EXPO 2005 in Aichi, Japan, where his glass composition ‘the Soul of the Piano’ was the main artefact in the Polish Pavilion, designed by prof. Krzysztof Ingarden, and at EXPO 2008 in Zaragoza, Spain, where his composition ‘Poland - Wind in the Sails’ was part of the national presentation.\\nArchitectural glass art composition by Tomasz Urbanowicz can also be found in many places around the world: the glass orb ‘The United Earth’ is a central artistic element on European Parliament building agora in Strasbourg, France; the glass rainbow ‘Larc en ciel’ decorates G. Brassens College in Paris, France; green glass castings enlight the lobby of the Holsten Brewery Headquarters in Hamburg, Germany; and the composition ‘Blue Sunset in the Ocean’ cruises around the world on one of the world\\'s biggest ocean liners Queen Mary 2.\\nOne of the artist\\'s works is a complex architectural glass composition with diverse musical notations in the foyer of the newly built Podlaskie Opera and Philharmonic building in Białystok, Poland.\\nIn 2014, Urbanowicz\\'s glass art works from the \\'GlassHenge\\' series were exhibited at the Wrocław Airport.\\nIn the years 2018-2019 Tomasz Urbanowicz together with prof. Przemysław Tyszkiewicz developed a new own technique to consolidate graphics in glass art. They created several joint works called \\'Corsydians\\' series, exhibited among others at the collective exhibition \"Para.Ceramics.Prints\\' in Oblastni galerie in Liberec or the collective exhibition \"Robinson\\'s Ship\" organized by the City Gallery and Museum of Architecture in Wrocław.\\nThe latest realizations of large-scale architectural glass art, made by Tomasz Urbanowicz in cooperation with his son, arch. Konrad Urbanowicz, include the composition \"The Spirit of Health\" at the Integrative Medical Center Clinic in Żerniki Wrocławskie and the glass art EGG - concierge desk in the baroque interior of the historic Main Building of the University of Wrocław.\\n\\n\\n== Selected projects ==\\n2019 - Glass Art EGG, Concierge Desk, Main Building, University of Wrocław\\n2018 - \\'The Spirit of Health\\', Glass Compositions, IMC Integrative Medical Center Clinic, Żerniki Wrocławskie\\n2015 - Artistic Glass Panels in Main Hall and Chapel, T.

              "  'Gilbert Prousch, sometimes referred to as Gilbert Proesch (born 17 September 1943), and George Passmore (born 8 January 1942) are artists who work together as the collaborative art duo Gilbert & George. They are known for their formal appearance and manner in performance art, and for their brightly coloured graphic-style photo-based artworks. In 2017 the pair celebrated their 50th anniversary as collaborators. In April 2023 Gilbert & George opened the Gilbert & George Centre in Heneage Street, London E1, to showcase their work in regular exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Early lives ==\\nGilbert Prousch was born in San Martin de Tor in South Tyrol, northern Italy, his native language being Ladin. He studied art at the Sëlva School of Art in Val Gardena and Hallein School of Art in Austria and the Akademie der Kunst, Munich, before moving to England.\\nGeorge Passmore was born in Plymouth in the United Kingdom, to a single mother in a low-income household. He dropped out of regular school by the time he was fifteen years old and studied art at Dartington College of Arts and then Oxford School of Art.\\nThe two first met on 25 September 1967 while studying sculpture at Saint Martin\\'s School of Art. The two claim they came together because George was the only person who could understand Gilbert\\'s rather poor English. In a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph, they said of their meeting: \"it was love at first sight\". They married in 2008. They are often seen together on walks through East London.\\nSince 1968, Gilbert & George have been residents of Fournier Street, Spitalfields, East London. They live in an 18th-century house that has been restored to its original decor. Their entire body of work has been created in, and focused on, London\\'s East End, which they see as a microcosm. According to George, \"Nothing happens in the world that doesn\\'t happen in the East End.\"\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nGilbert and George claim that their approach to art has always been anti-elitist. Adopting the slogan \\'Art for All\\', they aimed to be relevant beyond the narrow confines of the art world. Although they work in a variety of media, they have always referred to all of their works as \"sculpture\".\\nBetween 1970 and 1974 they made drawings (referred to as \\'Charcoal on Paper Sculptures\\') and paintings to give a more tangible form to their identity as \\'living sculptures\\'.\\nOne of their first notable works of art was a photographic self-portrait of them wearing their trademark suits. George the Cunt and Gilbert the Shit was so titled to forestall criticism.\\n\\n\\n=== Singing and living sculptures ===\\nWhilst still students, Gilbert & George made The Singing Sculpture, which was performed at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in 1969 and at the Nigel Greenwood Gallery in 1970. For this performance they covered their heads and hands in multi-coloured metalised powders, stood on a table, and sang along and moved to a recording of Flanagan and Allen\\'s song \"Underneath the Arches\", sometimes for a day at a time. The suits they wore for this became a uniform for them. They rarely appear in public without wearing them.\\nIt is also unusual for one of the pair to be seen without the other. The pair regard themselves as \"living sculptures\". They refuse to dissociate their art from their everyday lives, insisting that everything they do is art. They were listed as among the fifty best-dressed over-50s by The Guardian in March 2013.\\n\\n\\n=== The Pictures ===\\n\\nThe pair are known for their large scale photo works, known as The Pictures. The early work in this style is in black and white, later with hand-painted red and yellow touches. They proceeded to use a range of bolder colours, sometimes backlit, and overlaid with black grids. Their work has addressed a wide variety of subject matter including religion and patriotism. The two artists also often appear in their own \"pictures\". They have described their \"pictures\" as a sort of \"visual love letter from us to the viewer\".\\nIn 1986, Gilbert & George were criticised for a series of pictures seemingly glamourising \\'rough types\\' of London\\'s East End such as skinheads, while a picture of an Asian man bore the title \"Paki\". Some of their work has attracted media attention because of the inclusion of (potentially) shocking imagery, such as nudity, depictions of sexual acts, and bodily fluids (faeces, urine and semen). The titles of these works, such as Naked Shit Pictures (1994) and Sonofagod Pictures (2005), also contributed to the attention.\\nThe pair starred in a Documentary series in 1997 for LWT. It went on to win the BAFTA Award for the best documentary series.  A book, The Complete Pictures, 1971–2005, published in 2007 by Tate Modern, includes over a thousand examples of their art.\\nIn May 2007, Gilbert & George were the subject of the BBC documentary Imagine, presented by Alan Yentob. At the end of the programme a picture entitled \\'Planed\\' was made available as a free file download from the BBC and The Guardian websites for 48 hours. People who downloaded the files could then print and assemble the piece, and thus own an original Gilbert and George picture for free.\\n\\n\\n=== Jack Freak Pictures ===\\nJack Freak Pictures is, to date, the largest series of work created by Gilbert & George. According to Michael Bracewell \"the Jack Freak Pictures are among the most iconic, philosophically astute and visually violent works that Gilbert & George have ever created.\" The Union Jack and Gilbert & George are the two dominant pictorial images – appearing contorted, abstracted, and sometimes complete. The entire series is set in the East End of London indicated by flags, maps, street signs, graffiti and other less obvious motifs such as brickwork and foliage that can be found there.\\nAfter showing at White Cube\\'s Hoxton and Mason Yard galleries in 2009 the exhibition travelled to the Croatian Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb; The Kröller-Müller Museum, the Netherlands; Centro de Arte Contemporaneo de Malaga, Spain; Arndt & Partner gallery, Berlin; the Baronian Francey Gallery, Brussels; and the Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels.\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\nDuring lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilbert & George started an online video diary, posting weekly updates on life in their newly limited circumstances. The bulletins, often short films, were a continuation of their usual creative habit of documenting social change.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honours ==\\nGilbert & George have received acclaim with extensive solo exhibitions in the UK, USA, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Russia and China; numerous Honorary Doctorates from academic institutions including Plymouth University; and awards such as the Special International Award, the South Bank Award and the Lorenzo il Magnifico Award. In 1986 they won the Turner Prize which is widely considered to be the UK\\'s most prestigious contemporary art award. In 2005 they represented the UK at the Venice Biennale.\\nIn 2017, Gilbert & George were elected to the Royal Academy of Arts; in 2020, however, they resigned from the academy in reaction to a decision not to go ahead with an exhibition they had been planning to stage in its galleries.\\nNotable honours include:\\n\\n1981 – won the Regione Lazio Award (Torino)\\n1986 – won the Turner Prize\\n1989 – won the Special International Award (Los Angeles)\\n2005 – represented the UK at the Venice Biennale\\n2007 – their retrospective at Tate Modern was the largest of any of the artists who have had retrospectives there\\n2007 – won the South Bank Award, as well as the Lorenzo il Magnifico Award (Florence).\\nDecember 2008 – awarded Honorary Doctorates by London Metropolitan University.\\nOctober 2010 – awarded the honorary title \"Magister Artium Gandensis\" by University College Ghent\\nNovember 2010 – conferred with Honorary Doctorates by the University of East London\\nMarch 2012 – conferred with Honorary Doctorates by the Open University\\n2013 – awarded Honorary Doctorates of Arts by Plymouth University\\n2017 – elected as Royal Academicians by the Royal Academy of Arts in London, resigned in 2020\\n\\n\\n== Political stance ==\\nGilbert & George claim to be an oddity in the artistic world because of their openly conservative political views and their praise for Margaret Thatcher. George claims never to have been anti-establishment: \"You\\'re not allowed to be Conservative in the art world, of course,\" he says. \"Left equals good. Art equals Left. Pop stars and artists are meant to be so original. So how come everyone has the same opinion? ... We admire Margaret Thatcher greatly. She did a lot for art. Socialism wants everyone to be equal. We want to be different.\" Both are supportive of Brexit and the Conservative Party. The duo are monarchists and have said of the King, at the time Prince of Wales: \"We\\'re also fond of the Prince of Wales: he\\'s a gentleman.\" In a Guardian interview, they said that they opposed the removal of statues after the George Floyd protests, saying that \"they\\'re part of the city\" and that their removal is \"shameful\".\\n\\n\\n== Influence and legacy ==\\nGilbert & George inspired two characters, Man Green and Man Yellow, Chief Constables of the Science Gestapo, in Grant Morrison\\'s comicbook series The Filth. The two characters appear in pastiches of Gilbert & George\\'s artwork, with the separate sections of the imagery acting as individual comic book panels. The look that electronic music band Kraftwerk adopted between 1974 and 1978, with men in suits wearing ties, was partly inspired by Gilbert & George: musicians Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter had seen an exhibition of the artists in Düsseldorf in 1970 and were inspired by the idea of \"bringing art into everyday life\". Vic Reeves has explained to The Independent that Vic Reeves Big Night Out was initially thought of as \"performance art, like Gilbert and George\\'s singing sculpture\". David Bowie was a collector of the artists\\' work.\\nOn April 1, 2023, the Gilbert & George Centre was inaugurated on Heneage Street (near Aldgate East station).

              "  'Gerhard Richter (German: [ˈɡeːɐ̯haʁt ˈʁɪçtɐ]; born 9 February 1932) is a German visual artist. Richter has produced abstract as well as photorealistic paintings, and also photographs and glass pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Childhood and education ===\\nRichter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in Dresden, Saxony, and grew up in Reichenau (now Bogatynia, Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the Upper Lusatian countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard\\'s mother, Hildegard Schönfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard\\'s father, Ernst Alfred Schönfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard\\'s father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.\\nAfter struggling to maintain a position in the new National Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard\\'s younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau\\'s location in the countryside. Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies. When he was 10 years old, Gerhard was conscripted into the Deutsches Jungvolk; the Hitler Youth, for teenage boys, was dissolved at the end of the war, before Richter was old enough. In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano. Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, who had schizophrenia, was starved to death in the Nazi euthanasia program.\\nRichter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in Zittau, and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter. In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as \"too bourgeois\". He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were Karl von Appen, Heinz Lohmar and Will Grohmann.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationships ===\\nRichter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor Isa Genzken, in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, Sabine Moritz after they were married in 1995.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\nIn the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (Communion with Picasso, 1955) for the refectory of his Academy of Arts as part of his B.A. Another mural entitled Lebensfreude (Joy of life) followed at the German Hygiene Museum for his diploma. It was intended to produce an effect \"similar to that of wallpaper or tapestry\".\\n\\nFrom 1957 to 1961 Richter worked as a master trainee in the academy and took commissions for the then state of East Germany. During this time, he worked intensively on murals like Arbeiterkampf (Workers\\' struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress Angelica Domröse and of Richter\\'s first wife Ema), on various self-portraits and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name Stadtbild (Townscape, 1956).\\nTogether with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from East to West Germany two months before the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after German reunification, two \"windows\" of the wall painting Joy of life (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state.\\nIn West Germany Richter began to study at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf under Karl Otto Götz, together with Sigmar Polke, Werner Hilsing, HA Schult, Kuno Gonschior, Franz Erhard Walther, Konrad Lueg and Gotthard Graubner. With Polke and Konrad Fischer (pseudonym Lueg) he introduced the term Kapitalistischer Realismus (Capitalistic Realism) as an anti-style of art, appropriating the pictorial shorthand of advertising. This title also referred to the realist style of art known as Socialist Realism, then the official art doctrine of the Soviet Union, but it also commented upon the consumer-driven art doctrine of western capitalism.\\nRichter taught at the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design as a visiting professor; he returned to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1971, where he worked as a professor for over 15 years.\\nIn 1983, Richter resettled from Düsseldorf to Cologne, where he still lives and works today. In 1996, he moved into a studio designed by architect Thiess Marwede.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\n\\n\\n=== Photo-paintings and the \"blur\" ===\\n\\nRichter created various painting pictures from black-and-white photographs during the 1960s and early 1970s, basing them on a variety of sources: newspapers and books, sometimes incorporating their captions, (as in Helga Matura (1966)); private snapshots; aerial views of towns and mountains, (Cityscape Madrid (1968) and Alps (1968)); seascapes (1969–70); and a large multipart work made for the German Pavilion in the 1972 Venice Biennale. For Forty-eight Portraits (1971–72), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Jean Sibelius, and of writers such as H. G. Wells and Franz Kafka.\\nFrom around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter\\'s two portraits of Betty, his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled IG were made in 1993 and depict the artist\\'s second wife, Isa Genzken. Lesende (1994) portrays Sabine Moritz, whom Richter married in 1995, shown absorbed in the pages of a magazine. Many of his realist paintings reflect on the history of Nazism, creating paintings of family members who had been members, as well as victims, of the Nazi party. From 1966, as well as those given to him by others, Richter began using photographs he had taken as the basis for portraits. In 1975, on the occasion of a show in Düsseldorf, Gilbert & George commissioned Richter to make a portrait of them.\\nRichter began making prints in 1965. He was most active before 1974, only completing sporadic projects since that time. In the period 1965–1974, Richter made most of his prints (more than 100), of the same or similar subjects in his paintings. He has explored a variety of photographic printmaking processes – screenprint, photolithography, and collotype – in search of inexpensive mediums that would lend a \"non-art\" appearance to his work. He stopped working in print media in 1974, and began painting from photographs he took himself.\\nWhile elements of landscape painting appeared initially in Richter\\'s work early on in his career in 1963, the artist began his independent series of landscapes in 1968 after his first vacation, an excursion that landed him besotted with the terrain of Corsica. Landscapes have since emerged as an independent work group in his oeuvre. According to Dietmar Elger, Richter\\'s landscapes are understood within the context of traditional of German Romantic Painting. They are compared to the work of Caspar David Friedrich (1774–1840). Friedrich is foundational to German landscape painting. Each artist spent formative years of their lives in Dresden. Große Teyde-Landschaft (1971) takes its imagery from similar holiday snapshots of the volcanic regions of Tenerife.\\nAtlas was first exhibited in 1972 at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst in Utrecht under the title Atlas der Fotos und Skizzen, it included 315 parts. The work has continued to expand, and was exhibited later in full form at the Lenbachhaus in Munich in 1989, the Museum Ludwig in Cologne in 1990, and at Dia Art Foundation in New York in 1995. Atlas continues as an ongoing, encyclopedic work composed of approximately 4,000 photographs, reproductions or cut-out details of photographs and illustrations, grouped together on approximately 600 separate panels.\\nIn 1972, Richter embarked on a ten-day trip to Greenland, his friend Hanne Darboven was meant to accompany him, but instead he traveled alone. His intention was to experience and record the desolate arctic landscape. In 1976, four large paintings, each titled Seascape emerged from the Greenland photographs.\\nIn 1982 and 1983, Richter made a series of paintings of Candles and Skulls that relate to a longstanding tradition of still life memento mori painting. Each composition is most commonly based on a photograph taken by Richter in his own studio. Influenced by old master vanitas painters such as Georges de La Tour and Francisco de Zurbarán, the artist began to experiment with arrangements of candles and skulls placed in varying degrees of natural light, sitting atop otherwise barren tables. The Candle paintings coincided with his first large-scale abstract paintings, and represent the complete antithesis to those vast, colorful and playfully meaningless works. Richter has made only 27 of these still lifes. In 1995, the artist marked the 50th anniversary of the allied bombings of his hometown Dresden during the Second World War. His solitary candle was reproduced on a monumental scale and placed overlooking the River Elbe as a symbol of rejuvenation.\\nIn a 1988 series of 15 ambiguous photo paintings entitled 18 October 1977, he depicted four members of the Red Army Faction (RAF), a German left-wing militant organization. These paintings were created from black-and-white newspaper and police photos. Three RAF members were found dead in their prison cells on 18 October 1977 and the cause of their deaths was the focus of widespread controversy. In the late 1980s, Richter had begun to collect images of the group which he used as the basis for the 15 paintings exhibited for the first time in Krefeld in 1989. The paintings were based on an official portrait of Ulrike Meinhof during her years as a radical journalist; on photographs of the arrest of Holger Meins; on police shots of Gudrun Ensslin in prison; on Andreas Baader\\'s bookshelves and the record player to conceal his gun; on the dead figures of Meinhof, Ensslin, and Baader; and on the funeral of Ensslin, Baader, and Jan-Carl Raspe.\\nSince 1989, Richter has worked on creating new images by dragging wet paint over photographs. The photographs, not all taken by Richter himself, are mostly snapshots of daily life: family vacations, pictures of friends, mountains, buildings and streetscapes.\\nRichter was flying to New York on 11 September 2001, but due to the 9/11 attacks, including on the World Trade Center, his plane was diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia. A few years later, he made one small painting specifically about the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. In September: A History Painting by Gerhard Richter, Robert Storr situates Richter\\'s 2005 painting September within a brand of anti-ideological thought that he finds throughout Richter\\'s work. He considers how the ubiquitous photographic documentation of 11 September attacks affects the uniqueness of one\\'s distinct remembrance of the events, and he offers a valuable comparison to Richter\\'s 18 October 1977 cycle.\\nIn the 2000s, Richter made a number of works that dealt with scientific phenomena. In 2003, he produced several paintings with the same title: Silicate. Large oil-on-canvas pieces, these show latticed rows of light- and dark-grey blobs whose shapes quasi-repeat as they race across the frame, their angle modulating from painting to painting. They depict a photo, published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, of a computer-generated simulacrum of reflections from the silicon dioxide found in insects\\' shells.\\nIn 2014, Richter created a cycle of four paintings using the Sonderkommando photographs, which were taken in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp during the Holocaust, titled Birkenau.\\n\\n\\n=== Abstract work ===\\nRichter\\'s early work Table (1962) consisted of a painting of a table, taken from a photograph in a magazine, with tachiste gestural marks overlapping. Those marks can be read as cancelling the photorealist representation, using haptic swirls of grey paint, as well as a form of generativity. \\nIn 1969, Richter produced the first of a group of grey monochromes that consist exclusively of the textures resulting from different methods of paint application.\\nIn 1976, Richter first gave the title Abstract Painting to one of his works. By presenting a painting without even a few words to name and explain it, he felt he was \"letting a thing come, rather than creating it.\" In his abstract pictures, Richter builds up cumulative layers of non-representational painting, beginning with brushing big swaths of primary color onto canvas. The paintings evolve in stages, based on his responses to the picture\\'s progress: the incidental details and patterns that emerge. Throughout his process, Richter uses the same techniques he uses in his representational paintings, blurring and scraping to veil and expose prior layers.\\nFrom the mid-1980s, Richter began to use a homemade squeegee to rub and scrape the paint that he had applied in large bands across his canvases. In an interview with Benjamin H.D. Buchloch in 1986, Richter was asked about his \"Monochrome Grey Pictures and Abstract Pictures\" and their connection with the artists Yves Klein and Ellsworth Kelly. The following are Richter\\'s answers:\\n\\nThe Grey Pictures were done at a time when there were monochrome paintings everywhere. I painted them nonetheless. ... Not Kelly, but Bob Ryman, Brice Marden, Alan Charlton, Yves Klein and many others.\\nIn the 1990s the artist began to run his squeegee up and down the canvas in an ordered fashion to produce vertical columns that take on the look of a wall of planks.\\nRichter\\'s abstract work and its illusion of space developed out of his incidental process: an accumulation of spontaneous, reactive gestures of adding, moving, and subtracting paint. Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist\\'s tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.\\nFirenze continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter. The series of overpainted photographs, or übermalte Fotographien, consists of small paintings bearing images of the city of Florence, created by the artist as a tribute to the music of Steve Reich and the work of Contempoartensemble, a Florence-based group of musicians.\\nAfter 2000, Richter made a number of works that dealt with scientific phenomena, in particular, with aspects of reality that cannot be seen by the naked eye. In 2006, Richter conceived six paintings as a coherent group under the title Cage, named after the American avant-garde composer John Cage. The Cage paintings are large works constructed from intersecting fields, lines, and swaths of uneven smears that reflect the broad squeegee tool which Richter drags across the canvases, before removing areas of paint to generate a subtractive method of concealing and revealing variegated layers and patches. In May 2002, Richter photographed 216 details of his abstract painting no. 648-2, from 1987. Working on a long table over a period of several weeks, Richter combined these 10 x 15 cm details with 165 texts on the Iraq war, published in the German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper on 20 and 21 March. This work was published in 2004 as a book entitled War Cut.\\nIn November 2008, Richter began a series in which he applied ink droplets to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink\\'s natural tendency to bloom and creep. The resulting November sheets are regarded as a significant departure from his previous watercolours in that the pervasive soaking of ink into wet paper produced double-sided works. Sometimes the uppermost sheets bled into others, generating a sequentially developing series of images. In a few cases Richter applied lacquer to one side of the sheet, or drew pencil lines across the patches of colour.\\n\\n\\n=== Color chart paintings ===\\nAs early as 1966, Richter had made paintings based on colour charts, using the rectangles of colour as found objects in an apparently limitless variety of hue; these culminated in 1973–4 in a series of large-format pictures such as 256 Colours. Richter painted three series of Color Chart paintings between 1966 and 1974, each series growing more ambitious in their attempt to create through their purely arbitrary arrangement of colors. The artist began his investigations into the complex permutations of color charts in 1966, with a small painting entitled 10 Colors. The charts provided anonymous and impersonal source material, a way for Richter to disassociate color from any traditional, descriptive, symbolic or expressive end. When he began to make these paintings, Richter had his friend Blinky Palermo randomly call out colors, which Richter then adopted for his work. Chance thus plays its role in the creation of his first series.\\nReturning to color charts in the 1970s, Richter changed his focus from the readymade to the conceptual system, developing mathematical procedures for mixing colours and chance operations for their placement. The range of the colors he employed was determined by a mathematical system for mixing the primary colors in graduated amounts. Each color was then randomly ordered to create the resultant composition and form of the painting. Richter\\'s second series of Color Charts was begun in 1971 and consisted of only five paintings. In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.\\nRichter\\'s 4900 Colours from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color. It was produced at the same time he developed his design for the south transept window of Cologne Cathedral. 4900 Colours consists of 196 panels in 25 colors that can be reassembled in 11 variations – from a single expansive surface to multiple small-format fields. Richter developed Version II – 49 paintings, each of which measures 97 by 97 centimeters – especially for the Serpentine Gallery.\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\nRichter began to use glass in his work in 1967, when he made Four Panes of Glass. These plain sheets of glass could tilt away from the poles on which they were mounted at an angle that changed from one installation to the next. In 1970, he and Blinky Palermo jointly submitted designs for the sports facilities for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. For the front of the arena, they proposed an array of glass windows in twenty-seven different colors; each color would appear fifty times, with the distribution determined randomly. In 1981, for a two-person show with Georg Baselitz in Düsseldorf, Richter produced the first of the monumental transparent mirrors that appear intermittently thereafter in his oeuvre; the mirrors are significantly larger than Richter\\'s paintings and feature adjustable steel mounts. For pieces such as Mirror Painting (Grey, 735-2) (1991), the mirrors were coloured grey by the pigment attached to the back of the glass. Arranged in two rooms, Richter presented an ensemble of paintings and colored mirrors in a special pavilion designed in collaboration with architect Paul Robbrecht at Documenta 9 in Kassel in 1992.\\nIn 2002, for the Dia Art Foundation, Richter created a glass sculpture in which seven parallel panes of glass refract light and the world beyond, offering altered visions of the exhibition space; Spiegel I (Mirror I) and Spiegel II (Mirror II), a two-part mirror piece from 1989 that measures 7\\' tall and 18\\' feet long, which alters the boundaries of the environment and again changes one\\'s visual experience of the gallery; and Kugel (Sphere), 1992, a stainless steel sphere that acts as a mirror, reflecting the space. Since 2002, the artist has created a series of three dimensional glass constructions, such as 6 Standing Glass Panels (2002/2011).\\n\\n\\n=== Drawings ===\\nIn 2010, the Drawing Center showed Lines which do not exist, a survey of Richter\\'s drawings from 1966 to 2005, including works made using mechanical intervention such as attaching a pencil to an electric hand drill. It was the first career overview of Richter in the United States since 40 Years of Painting at the Museum of Modern Art in 2002. In a review of Lines which do not exist, R. H. Lossin wrote in The Brooklyn Rail: \"Viewed as a personal (and possibly professional) deficiency, Richter\\'s drawing practice consisted of diligently documenting something that didn\\'t work—namely a hand that couldn\\'t draw properly. ...Richter displaces the concept of the artist\\'s hand with hard evidence of his own, wobbly, failed, and very material appendage.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nThroughout his career, Richter has mostly declined lucrative licensing deals and private commissions. Measuring 9 by 9 ½ feet and depicting both the Milan Duomo and the square\\'s 19th-century Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, Domplatz, Mailand (1968) was a commission from Siemens, and it hung in that company\\'s offices in Milan from 1968 to 1998. (In 1998, Sotheby\\'s sold it in London, where it fetched what was then a record price for Richter, $3.6 million). In 1980, Richter and Isa Genzken were commissioned to design the König-Heinrich-Platz underground station in Duisburg; it was only completed in 1992. In 1986, Richter received a commission for two large-scale paintings – Victoria I and Victoria II – from the Victoria insurance company in Düsseldorf. In 1990, along with Sol LeWitt and Oswald Mathias Ungers, he created works for the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank in Düsseldorf. In 1998, he installed a wall piece based on the colours of Germany\\'s flag in the rebuilt Reichstag in Berlin. In 2012 he was asked to design the first page of the German newspaper Die Welt. In 2017 Richter designed the label of the 2015 Chateau Mouton Rothschild\\'s first wine of that year.\\n\\n\\n=== Church windows ===\\n\\nIn 2002, the same year as his MoMA retrospective, Richter was asked to design a stained glass window in the Cologne Cathedral.\\nIn August 2007, his window was unveiled. It is an 113 square metres (1,220 sq ft) abstract collage of 11,500 pixel-like squares in 72 colors, randomly arranged by computer (with some symmetry), reminiscent of his 1974 painting 4096 colours. The artist waived any fee, and the costs of materials and mounting the window came to around €370,000 ($506,000), covered by donations from more than 1,000 people. Cardinal Joachim Meisner did not attend the window\\'s unveiling as he would have preferred it to have been a figurative representation of 20th century Christian martyrs and said that Richter\\'s window would fit better in a mosque or other prayer house. A professed atheist with \"a strong leaning towards Catholicism\", Richter had his three children with his third wife baptized in the Cologne Cathedral.\\nIn September 2020, Richter unveiled his three 30-foot-tall stained-glass windows for the Tholey Abbey, one of the oldest monasteries in Germany. He called them his last major work, adding that he would focus on drawings and sketches from then on. The large choir windows were made by Gustva van Treeck, an esteemed glass workshop in nearby Munich. They are abstract painted works inspired by his \"Pattern\" series from the 1990s. An additional 34 figurative stained glass windows designed for the abbey by Afghan-German Muslim artist Mahbuba Maqsoodi are expected to be completed by Easter 2021. The monks of the abbey hoped the windows would promote tourism to the abbey and its town and bring people into the faith.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nRichter first began exhibiting in Düsseldorf in 1963. Richter had his first gallery solo show in 1964 at Galerie Schmela in Düsseldorf. Soon after, he had exhibitions in Munich and Berlin and by the early 1970s exhibited frequently throughout Europe and the United States. In 1966, Bruno Bischofberger was the first to show Richter\\'s works outside Germany. Richter\\'s first retrospective took place at the Kunsthalle Bremen in 1976 and covered works from 1962 to 1974. A traveling retrospective at Düsseldorf\\'s Kunsthalle in 1986 was followed in 1991 by a retrospective at the Tate Gallery, London. In 1993, he received a major touring retrospective \"Gerhard Richter: Malerei 1962–1993\" curated by Kasper König, with a three volume catalogue edited by Benjamin Buchloh. This exhibition containing 130 works carried out over the course of thirty years, was to entirely reinvent Richter\\'s career.\\nRichter became known to a U.S. audience in 1990, when the Saint Louis Art Museum circulated Baader-Meinhof (18 October 1977), a show that that was later seen at the Lannan Foundation in Marina del Rey, California. Richter\\'s first North American retrospective was in 1998 at the Art Gallery of Ontario and at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. In 2002, a 40-year retrospective of Richter\\'s work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. His work is included in the permanent collections of several museum institutions in the US, such as the Pérez Art Museum Miami. \\nHe has participated in several international art shows, including the Venice Biennale (1972, 1980, 1984, 1997 and 2007), as well as Documenta V (1972), VII (1982), VIII (1987), IX (1992), and X (1997). In 2006, an exhibition at the Getty Center connected the landscapes of Richter to the Romantic pictures of Caspar David Friedrich, showing that both artists \"used abstraction, expansiveness, and emptiness to express transcendent emotion through painting.\"\\nThe Gerhard Richter Archive was established in cooperation with the artist in 2005 as an institute of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\\nThe first major exhibition of his work in Australia, Gerhard Richter: The Life of Images, was mounted by the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane from 14 October 2017 to 4 February 2018. It included more than 90 works, including the newly created Atlas Overview, a 400-panel extract selected by Richter from the larger Atlas project now deemed too fragile for loan or travel.\\nIn 2022 the Raphael Durazzo Gallery exhibited 2014: 20.

Today, many call Gerhard Richter the best living painter. In part, this comes from his ability to explore the medium at a time when many were heralding its death. Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the Praemium Imperiale, Japan, 1997; the Golden Lion of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the Wolf Prize in Israel in 1994/5; the Goslarer Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, Mönchehaus-Museum für Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Vienna, 1985; the Arnold Bode Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2012.\\n\\n\\n=== Influence ===\\nAmong the students who studied with Richter at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf between 1971 and 1994 were Ludger Gerdes, Hans-Jörg Holubitschka, Bernard Lokai, Thomas Schütte, Thomas Struth, Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter\\'s second wife, Isa Genzken. He is known to have influenced Ellsworth Kelly, Christopher Wool and Johan Andersson.\\nHe has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians. Sonic Youth used a painting of his for the cover art for their album Daydream Nation in 1988. He was a fan of the band and did not charge for the use of his image. The original, over 7 metres (23 ft) square, is now showcased in Sonic Youth\\'s studio in NYC. Don DeLillo\\'s short story \"Baader-Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The meeting takes place in the room displaying 18 October 1977 (1988).\\nPhotographer Cotton Coulson described Richter as \"one of [his] favourite artists\".\\nFor the last 18 years, Gerhard Richter has been the number one on a Kunstkompass scale of most important world artists, made by a German magazine Capital.\\n\\n\\n=== Position in the art market ===\\nFollowing an exhibition with Blinky Palermo at Galerie Heiner Friedrich in 1971, Richter\\'s formal arrangement with the dealer came to an end in 1972. Thereafter Friedrich was only entitled to sell the paintings that he had already obtained contractually from Richter. In the following years, Richter showed with Galerie Konrad Fischer, Düsseldorf, and Sperone Westwater, New York. Today Richter is represented by Marian Goodman, his primary dealer since 1985.\\nToday, museums own roughly 38% of Richter\\'s works, including half of his large abstract paintings. By 2004, Richter\\'s annual turnover was $120 million. At the same time, his works often appear at auction. According to artnet, an online firm that tracks the art market, $76.9 million worth of Richter\\'s work was sold at auction in 2010. Richter\\'s high turnover volume reflects his prolificacy as well as his popularity. As of 2012, no fewer than 545 distinct Richter\\'s works had sold at auctions for more than $100,000. 15 of them had sold for more than $10,000,000 between 2007 and 2012. Richter\\'s paintings have been flowing steadily out of Germany since the mid-1990s even as certain important German collectors – Frieder Burda, Josef Fröhlich, Georg Böckmann, and Ulrich Ströher – have held on to theirs.\\nRichter\\'s candle paintings were the first to command high auction prices. Three months after his MoMA exhibition opened in 2001, Sotheby\\'s sold his Three Candles (1982) for $5.3 million. In February 2008, the artist\\'s eldest daughter, Betty, sold her Kerze (1983) for £7,972,500 ($15 million), triple the high estimate, at Sotheby\\'s in London. His 1982 Kerze (Candle) sold for £10.5 million ($16.5 million) at Christie\\'s London in October 2011.\\nIn February 2008, Christie\\'s London set a first record for Richter\\'s \"capitalist realism\" pictures from the 1960s by selling the painting Zwei Liebespaare (1966) for £7,300,500 ($14.3 million) to Stephan Schmidheiny. In 2010, the Weserburg modern art museum in Bremen, Germany, decided to sell Richter\\'s 1966 painting Matrosen (Sailors) in a November auction held by Sotheby\\'s, where John D. Arnold bought it for $13 million. Vierwaldstätter See, the largest of a distinct series of four views of Lake Lucerne painted by Richter in 1969, sold for £15.8 million ($24 million) at Christie\\'s London in 2015.\\nAnother coveted group of works is the Abstrakte Bilder series, particularly those made after 1988, which are finished with a large squeegee rather than a brush or roller. At Pierre Bergé & Associés in July 2009, Richter\\'s 1979 oil painting Abstraktes Bild exceeded its estimate, selling for €95,000 ($136,000). Richter\\'s Abstraktes Bild, of 1990 was made the top price of 7.2 million pounds, or about $11.6 million, at a Sotheby\\'s sale in February 2011 to a bidder who was said by dealers to be an agent for the New York dealer Larry Gagosian. In November 2011, Sotheby\\'s sold a group of colorful abstract canvases by Richter, including Abstraktes Bild 849-3, which made a record price for the artist at auction when Lily Safra paid $20.8 million only to donate it to the Israel Museum afterwards. Months later, a record $21.8 million was paid at Christie\\'s for the 1993 painting Abstraktes Bild 798-3. Abstraktes Bild (809–4), one of the artist\\'s abstract canvases from 1994, was sold by Eric Clapton at Sotheby\\'s to a telephone bidder for $34.2 million in late 2012. (It had been estimated to bring $14.1 million to $18.8 million.)\\nThis was exceeded in May 2013 when his 1968 piece Domplatz, Mailand (Cathedral square, Milan) was sold for $37.1 million (£24.4 million) in New York. This was further exceeded in February 2015 when his 1986 painting Abstraktes Bild (599) sold for $44.52 million (£30.4 million) in London at Sotheby\\'s Contemporary Evening Sale. This was the highest price at auction of a piece of contemporary art at the time; Richter\\'s record was broken on 12 November 2013 when Jeff Koons\\' Balloon Dog (Orange), sold at Christie\\'s Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale in New York City for US$58.4 million.\\nWhen asked about art prices like these, Richter said \"It\\'s just as absurd as the banking crisis. It\\'s impossible to understand and it\\'s daft!\"\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\n\\nIn 2003, Gerald Fox made a documentary on the life of Gerhard Richter in which he starred. In 2007, Corinna Belz made a short film called Gerhard Richter\\'s Window. In 2011, Belz\\'s feature-length documentary entitled Gerhard Richter Painting was released. The film focused almost entirely on the world\\'s highest paid living artist producing his large-scale abstract squeegee works in his studio. The 2018 drama film Never Look Away is inspired by Richter\\'s life story.\\nIn 2016 and 2019 Richter worked again with Corinna Belz on two films based on his 2012 book Patterns. The previous piece named Richters Patterns when shown is partnered with music by the German composer Marcus Schmickler, the later by the American composer Steve Reich, both performed by a live ensemble. The later work in turn is part of a larger two-section collaboration, Reich Richter Pärt which was commissioned for the inaugural season at The Shed in the Hudson Yards development in Manhattan in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nWand (Wall)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sources ===\\nElger, Dietmar (2009).

              "  'Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger (born March 23, 1948) is an Israeli-French artist, writer, psychoanalyst and philosopher, born in Mandatory Palestine and living and working in Paris. She is a feminist theorist and artist in contemporary New European Painting who invented the concept of the Matrixial Gaze and related concepts around trauma, aesthetics and ethics. Ettinger is a professor at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland and at GCAS, Dublin. In 2023, she was part of the Finding Committee for the Artistic Director of Documenta\\'s 2027 edition. She resigned from that role with a public letter intended to open a radical discussion in the artworld, following the administration\\'s rejection of her request for a pause due to the attacks on civilians in Israel and in Gaza and the ongoing heavy losses of life.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nBracha Lichtenberg was born to Jewish-Polish Holocaust survivors in Tel Aviv on 23 March 1948. She received her M.A. in Clinical Psychology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where she worked as research assistant for, then as personal assistant of, Amos Tversky (1969/70, 1973/74, 1974/75) and Danny Kahneman (1970/71). She moved to London where she studied, trained, and worked between 1975 and 1979 at the London Centre for Psychotherapy (with Elsa Seglow), the Tavistock Clinic, and the Philadelphia Association (with R. D. Laing) and became a British citizen. She married Loni Ettinger in 1975 and divorced him in 1981; her daughter, the actress Lana Ettinger, was born in London. \\nEttinger returned to Israel in 1979 and worked at Shalvata Hospital. She has painted and drawn since early childhood, self-taught. In her early days she avoided the art scene. In 1981, she divorced her first husband, decided to become a professional artist and moved to Paris where she lived and worked from 1981 onward. Her son, Itai Toker, was born in 1988. She returned to Tel Aviv in 2003. As well as painting, drawing and photography, she began writing, and received a D.E.A. in Psychoanalysis from the University Paris VII Diderot in 1987, and a Ph.D. in Aesthetics of Art from the University of Paris VIII in 1996.\\nEttinger had a solo project at the Pompidou Centre in 1987, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Calais in 1988. In 1995, she had a solo exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and in 1996 she participated in the Contemporary art section of Face à l\\'Histoire. 1933–1996 exhibition in the Pompidou Centre. In 2000, she had a mid-life retrospective at the Centre for Fine Arts (The Palais des Beaux Arts) in Brussels, and in 2001 a solo exhibition at the Drawing Center in New York. She continued to train as a psychoanalyst with Françoise Dolto, Piera Auglanier, Pierre Fedida, and Jacques-Alain Miller, and became an influential contemporary French feminist. \\nAround 1988, Ettinger began her Conversation and Photography project. Her personal art notebooks have become source for theoretical articulations. Her art has inspired historian Griselda Pollock, international curator Catherine de Zegher, and philosophers Jean-François Lyotard, Christine Buci-Glucksmann and Brian Massumi, who dedicated a number of essays to her painting.\\nBased mainly in Paris, Ettinger was visiting professor (1997–1998) and then research professor (1999–2004) in psychoanalysis and aesthetics at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the University of Leeds. Since 2001, she has been visiting professor in Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics at the AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History (now CentreCATH). Ettinger had returned to Tel Aviv on a part-time basis in 2003 when she separated from her partner. She was a lecturer at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem until 2006, when she became Chair and Professor at the EGS. She founded the matrixial theory in psychoanalysis.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic ==\\n\\nEttinger\\'s art engages in the subject of trauma, mothers and women during war as well as the feminine in mythology: Eurydice, Medusa, Demeter, Persephone, and matrixial Eros. Her abstract research in painting concerns light and space, which follows Monet and Rothko. Her subjects concern the human condition and the tragedy of war, and her work in this aspect joins artists such as Käthe Kollwitz and Francisco Goya. The painting process engages a space of passage between figures and abstraction, and her attitude to abstraction resonates with the spiritual concerns of Agnes Martin, Emma Kunz and Hilma af Klint. Her notebooks accompany the painting process but are equally artworks.\\n\\nFrom 1981-92, her principal artwork consisted of drawing and mixed media on paper as well as notebooks and artist\\'s books, where alongside theoretical work and conversations she made ink and wash painting and drawing. Since 1992, apart from her notebooks, most of her artwork consists of mixed media and oil paintings, with a few parallel series that spread over time like \"Matrix — Family Album\", \"Autistwork\" and \"Eurydice\", with themes of transgenerational transmission of personal and historical trauma, traces of memory and remnants of oblivion, the Shoah and the World Wars, the gaze, light, color and the space, female body, womanhood and maternality, inspired by classical painting and creating an abstract space where the questions of beauty and sublime are renewed for our time.\\nAccording to Griselda Pollock, Catherine de Zegher and Chris Dercon, director of the Tate Modern who had chosen her work for the contemporary art section of the Pompidou Center\\'s major exhibition of 20th Century art Face à l\\'Histoire, Ettinger has become one of the major artists of the New European Painting. Along with painting she has worked on installations, theoretical research, lectures, video works, and \"encounter events\". Her paintings, photos, drawings, and notebooks have been exhibited at the Pompidou Centre, and the Stedelijk Museum in 1997. In the last decade, Ettinger\\'s oil on canvas paintings involve figures like Medusa, Demeter and Persephone, and Eurydice, and the subject matter of the Pietà, the Kaddish, Eros, and Chronos. From 2010 onward, her work still consists mainly of oil paintings, notebooks (artist\\'s books) and drawings, she is doing new media animated video films where the images are multi-layered like her painting. In 2015, she participated with a solo show in the 14th Istanbul Biennial drafted and curated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev. In 2018-19 she participated with a solo show at the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018 in India.2019.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nEttinger\\'s work consists mostly of oil painting and writing. Ettinger is now considered to be a prominent figure among both the French painters\\' and the Israeli art\\'s scenes. Her art was analysed at length in the book Women Artists at the Millennium, in Griselda Pollock\\'s Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum and in Catherine de Zegher\\'s anthology Women\\'s Work is Never Done. Her ideas in cultural theory, psychoanalysis, and French feminism (see Feminist theory and psychoanalysis) achieved recognition after the publication of Matrix and Metramorphosis (1992), fragments from her notebooks (Moma, Oxford, 1993) and The Matrixial Gaze (1995). Ettinger established a new area of studies in psychoanalysis, art and feminism. Over the last three decades, her work has been influential in art history. \\n\\n\\n== Psychoanalyst ==\\nEttinger is a theoretician who invented and developed a language for a feminine-maternal-\\'matrixial\\' (matricial) dimension in artistic creativity and in ethics of care and responsibility. She coined the concept of matrixial (matricial) space and matrixial gaze first in her artistic Notebooks from 1985 onward, and in academic publications from 1992 onward. \\nEttinger\\'s \\'matrixial theory\\' articulating transjectivity and transubjectivity in the subject and in human relationships had proposed an unconscious feminine/maternal and pre-maternal/prenatal time-space of feminine sexuality and femininity in all genders, which go together with ethics of care and wonder, \\'seduction-into-life\\' and responsibility, where trans-subjectivity is in an ontology of string-like subject-subject (trans-subjective) and subject-object (transjective) transmissivity and affective co-emergence, transformed the way to think both the feminine and the human subject, both the analyst in transference relation and the analysant in its relation to her, in psychoanalysis. Working on the question of trauma, memory and oblivion at the intersections of human subjectivity, feminine sexuality, maternal subjectivity, psychoanalysis, art and aesthetics, she contributed to psychoanalysis the idea of a feminine-maternal sphere of sexuality and ethics, function, and structure where symbolic and imaginary dimensions are based on femaleness in the real (the meaning of matrix is womb). This dimension, as symbolic, contributes to ethical thinking about human responsibility to one another and to the world. The French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard related to Ettinger\\'s writing and painting in two famous articles written in 1993 and 1995, Anima Minima (Diffracted Traces)  andL\\'anamnese (anamnesis). She is a senior clinical psychologist, and a supervising and training psychoanalyst. Her artistic practice and her articulation, since 1985, of what has become known as the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity have transformed contemporary debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women\\'s studies, and cultural studies. Ettinger was an analysand of Ronald Laing in London and of Piera Aulagnier in Paris. She is member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis (TAICP), the New Lacanian School (NLS) and the World Association of Psychoanalysis (AMP / WAP). \\nFor Ettinger, the Freudian attitude to psychoanalysis is crucial as it emphasizes the phantasmatic value of materials that arise during regression. To Freud and Lacan she adds, however, a feminine-maternal space-time with its particular structures, functions, Eros, Aesthetic, Ethics and ethical potentiality (she names matrixial proto-ethics) and dynamics in the unconscious. She claims that, in a similar way, when seduction is assigned to the paternal figure during regression, it is recognized in most cases as a result of the therapeutic process itself. The analyst therefore must become aware to her capacity for a \\'seduction into life\\' as well as for retraumatizing the analysand. A matrixial ethical countertransference can be worked-through only in \\'empathy within compassion\\' in where therapist avoids parent-blaming. The analyst develops her psychic womb-space to be able to work with the matrixial sphere for the directing of healing. Therapists must likewise realize that during regression phantasmatic maternal \"not-enoughness\" appears and must also be recognized as the result of the process itself, and be worked-through without the mother-hating that Ettinger considers contributes to a \"psychotization\" of the subject, which blocks the passage from rage to sorrow and from there to compassion. To be able to recognize the phantasmatic status of the psychic material arising during therapy, the Lacanian concepts of the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real are useful to her. Ettinger works between the fields of psychoanalysis and philosophy to change Ethics according to the feminine-maternal-matrixial source after Levinas and Lacan. She is also rethinging and gives new meaning the concepts of beauty and of the sublime.\\n\\n\\n=== Psychoanalytic theory ===\\n\\n\\n==== Major concepts ====\\nEttinger revolutionized the field of psychoanalysis and cultural studies when she coined in artist\\'s books (Notebooks) that she exposed publicly starting from 1985 and in a long series of articles published since 1991 the concept of the matrixial (matricial) space and proposed the feminine matrixial time-space of feminine/prenatal encounter-event as source of human aesthetics and proto-ethics, and femininity as the deep core of ethics, which enters the human subjectivity via the maternal. \\nEttinger invented and developed the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply \"The Matrixial\", with original concepts like matrixial gaze, borderlinking, borderspacing, matrixial time-space, copoiesis, wit(h)nessing, co/in-habit(u)ation, transubjectivity, transjectivity, fascinance, seduction-into-life and carriance. She named the processes of transformation in a matrixial sphere: metramorphoses, and proposed the coemergnce of partial-subjects of I and non-I, female-prematernal-prenatal encounter, Encounter-event, ethical seduction into life, uncanny compassion and uncanny awe (that supplement the uncanny anxiety), fascinance, proto-ethics, being-toward-birth with being-toward-birthing, seduction into life, empathy within compassion, carriance (caring-carrying in the unconscious space of psychic pregnancy) and the matricial feminine-maternal Eros.\\n\\n\\n==== The early theory: from 1985 through the 1990s ====\\nEttinger invented the concept \\'matrixial space\\' (\\'matricial space\\' from etymology of \\'womb\\'), matrixial gaze, matrixial sphere, a feminine-maternal and feminine-prematernal transjective dimension, space, function, Eros and dynamics in the human Unconscious that as the source of humanized ethics and aesthetics, and developed a theoretical philosophical field in her artist\\'s books and notebooks starting 1985, and in books and journals printed in academic journals from 1991 onwards. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. \"I\" and \"non-I\", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious \"strings\", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes (\"feminine\", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the \\'matrixial gaze\\' and the process of \\'metramorphosis\\' and \\'co-poiesis\\'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first sexual difference for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminine-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection (Julia Kristeva) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant\\'s primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Awareness to the matrixial time-space, pre-maternal com-passion and maternal compassion together with the ethical \\'seduction-into-life\\' it involves, is source of responsibility. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordureliance) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacement) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to \"inter-subjectivity\" and \"self\" psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is \"The Matrixial Borderspace\" (reprint of essays from 1994–1999) published in French in 1999 and in English in 2006, but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005–2006.\\n\\n\\n==== The theory in the 2000s ====\\nHer more recent artistic and theoretical work centers around the spiritual in art and ethics. In the domain of psychoanalysis, around the question of same-sex differences, the primary feminine difference is the difference opened between woman (girl) and woman (m/Other), maternal subjectivity, maternal/pregnance Eros of com-passion, the effects of compassion and awe and the passion for borderlinking and borderspacing and the idea that three kinds of fantasy (that she names Mother-fantasies) should be recognized, when they appear in a state of regression aroused by therapy itself, as primal: Mother-fantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment. Their mis-recognition in psychoanalysis (and analytical therapy), together with the ignorance of maternal Eros of com-passion leads to catastrophic blows to the matrixial daughter-mother tissue and hurts the maternal potentiality of the daughter herself, in the sense that attacking the \"non-I\" is always also attacking the \"I\" that dwells inside an \"I\"-and-\"non-I\" trans-subjective matrixial (feminine-maternal) tissue. Contributing to Self psychoanalysis after Heinz Kohut, Ettinger articulated the difference between com-passionate borderlinking, compassion (as affect) and empathy, and between \"empathy without compassion\" and \"empathy within compassion\", claiming that the analyst\\'s empathy without compassion harms the matrixial psychic tissue of the analysand, while empathy within compassion leads to creativity and to the broadening of the ethical horizon. Ettinger explains how by empathy (toward the patient\\'s complaints) without compassion (toward the patient\\'s surrounding past and present family figures, no less than toward the patient itself), the therapist \"produces\" the patient\\'s real mother as a \"ready-made monster-mother\" figure, that serves to absorb complaints of all kinds, and thus, a dangerous splitting is induced between the \"good\" mother figure (the therapist) and a \"bad\" mother figure (the real mother). This splitting is destructive in both internal and external terms, and mainly for the daughter-mother relations, since the I and non-I are in any case always trans-connected, and therefore any split and projected hate (toward such figures) will turn into a self-hate in the woman/daughter web. Such a concept of subjectivity, where \"non-I\" is trans-connected to the \"I\", has deep ethical implications as well as far-reaching sociological and political implications that have been further developed by Griselda Pollock in order to rethink modern and postmodern art and History. Ettinger\\'s recent theoretical proposals starting around 2008 include the three Shocks of maternality and the paternal infnticide impulses (Laius Complex) Carriance and the Demeter–Persephone Complex, working around Greek Mythology and the Hebrew Bible, the woman artists Eva Hesse, Hilma af Klint and Emma Kunz and the poets and writers Sylvia Plath, Marguerite Duras and Alejandra Pizarnik.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\n\\nEttinger led the biggest rescue, evacuation and saving operation in the history of the Middle East: saving the drowning young men of the Eilat shipwreck (in 1967), when she was 19 years old. She was wounded during the operation and suffered shell-shock after it. More than a half-century later, the details of this event were declassified and she was awarded the highest Air-Force Medal for Heroism. \\nEttinger is a supporter of human rights and stands for coexistence of two states, Israel and Palestine, side by side in mutual respect. She is feminist activist for peace and against the occupation for few decades, engaged in the efforts towards cohabitation in the frame of four different organizations of Israelis and Palestinians collaborating together: \"Women Make Peace\", \"Forum of Bereaved Families\", \"Combatants for Peace\" and \"Physicians for Human Rights\" (\"PHR-Israel\"). Ettinger contributes to the organization as senior clinical psychologist, attending Palestinian patients in needed areas in the Palestinian territories.\\nEttinger is known for her portrait photography, taken in the context of conversation projects. Some of her portraits, like those of Christian Boltanski, Jean-François Lyotard, Edmond Jabès, Emmanuel Lévinas, Robert Doisneau and Yeshayahu Leibowitz appear in several official publications and collections.\\n\\n\\n=== Fascinance: Forum for Ettinger Studies ===\\nThe other and the earth need to be known through affective communicaring in self-fragilization. The knowledge revealed in this way, of the invisible chords to which our senses are not yet attuned, is at the basis of the ethical obligation to attend to the vulnerability of the other, human, animal, and even our shared earth, through care and compassion and in wonder and reverence. Lets work together against retraumatization and toward an understanding of a human subject which is informed by feminine transubjectivity in all genders, and become sensitive to the particular Eros of borderlinking between each I and non-I, which is a kind of love...\\nFascinance is forum which was started by Srishti Madurai in South India on 24 December 2013 which offers Introductory Course in Ettingerian Psychoanalysis\\nThe aims of the forum are:\\n\\nTo Read, Study and Discuss the works of Bracha L. Ettinger.\\nTo apply the matrixial theory in arts, philosophy, psychoanalysis and art criticism.\\nTo Find the possible implications of the concept of \"non-life\" of Bracha Ettinger in conjunction with the knowledge from various branches of biology such as clinical embryology, nenonatal immunology and developmental biology etc.\\nTo elaborate on the works on Matrixial Thanatos and Matrixial Eros and how Ettinger\\'s approach differs from the traditional views on death drive.\\nTo identify how the Ettingerian theory differs from other psychoanalytic tradition and to discuss the philosophical aspects of matrixial borderspace.\\nTo identify the possible connections of Ettinger\\'s works with natural sciences and social sciences.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nEttinger is author of several books and more than eighty psychoanalytical essays elaborating different aesthetical, ethical, psychoanalytical and artistic aspects of the matrixial. She is co-author of volumes of conversation with Emmanuel Levinas, Edmond Jabès, Craigie Horsfield, Félix Guattari and Christian Boltanski. Her book Regard et Espace-de-Bord Matrixiels (essays 1994–1999) appeared in French in 1999 (La lettre volée), and has been published in English as The Matrixial Borderspace (2006, University of Minnesota Press, edited by Brian Massumi and foreword by Judith Butler and Griselda Pollock). [1] Ettinger is one of the leading intellectuals associated with contemporary French feminism and feminist psychoanalytical thought alongside Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray. The journal Theory Culture & Society dedicated an issue to her work [TC&S, Vol.21, n.1] in 2004.\\n\\n\\n=== Selected books ===\\nMatrixial Subjectivity, Aesthetics, Ethics. Vol 1: 1990-2000.

              "  'ORLAN is a French multi-media artist who uses sculpture, photography, performance, video, video games, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and robotics as well as scientific and medical techniques such as surgery and biotechnology to question modern social phenomena. \\nShe has said that her art is not body art, but \\'carnal art,\\' which lacks the suffering aspect of body art.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nSince the 1960s and the 1970s, ORLAN has questioned the status of the body and the political, religious, social, and traditional pressures that are inscribed in it. Her work denounces the violence done to the body and in particular to women\\'s bodies, and thus engages in a feminist struggle. She makes her body the privileged instrument where our own relationship to otherness is played out. This work of Orlan on the body is done in particular by the means of photography.\\nIn 1976, for example, she walked the streets wearing a dress on which her naked body was represented. In the same period, in Portugal, she offered photos glued to wood and cut out corresponding to pieces of herself: an arm, a piece of breast, etc.\\nIn 1977, ORLAN performed Kiss of the artist (Baiser de l\\'artiste), during the International Fair of Contemporary Art (FIAC ), in the Grand Palais in Paris. ORLAN displayed a life-size photograph of her own nude torso, which she sat behind. The life-sized photograph was turned into a slot machine. A spectator would insert a coin and could see it descending to the groin before being awarded a kiss from the artist herself. The installation created a scandal that cost the artist her teaching position.\\nIn 1978, she created the International Symposium of the Performance in Lyon, which she animated until 1982.\\nHer manifesto of \"carnal art\" (Manifeste de l\\'Art Charnel) is followed by a series of surgical operations- performances that she carries out between 1990 and 1993. With this series, the body of the artist becomes a place of public debate. These surgical operations - performances were widely publicized and provoked a strong polemic, although they represent only a tiny part of her integral work.\\nORLAN also explores the use of new technologies in the arts.\\nIn 1982, with Frédéric Develay, she created the first online magazine of contemporary art, Art-Accès-Revue, on Minitel. \\nThis magazine invites international artists working in situ and/or with conceptual problems to create original works specially conceived on Minitel, by Minitel, and for Minitel. Many of the works play with the Videotex graphic style or ironically imitate Minitel services (Bernar Venet, Vera Molnár, Ben, François Morellet, Daniel Buren...)\\nThe works are accompanied by critical essays. The service also regularly gives the floor to the public. A public presentation of this database took place at the Centre Pompidou during the exhibition Les Immatériaux by Jean-François Lyotard. The Art-Access service has been distributed free of charge by the city of Metz server: MIRABEL.\\nIn her work of the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Self-Hybridations\", the artist, through digital photography and computer graphics editing software, hybridizes faces from different cultures (Native American, pre-Columbian, African).\\nOrlan then attempted to further expand the boundaries of contemporary art by using biotechnology to create an installation entitled Harlequin Coat made from the artist\\'s own cells and cells of human and animal origin.\\nAt the same time, ORLAN taught at the École nationale supérieure d\\'arts de Paris-Cergy. \\nIn 2005, she was awarded a one-year residency at the ISCP in New York by l\\'Association française d\\'action artistique (AFAA), and in 2006 she was invited to Los Angeles for a residency at the Getty Research Institute, the Getty Center\\'s research laboratory.\\nIn June 2013, she filed a complaint against Lady Gaga for plagiarism. For ORLAN, the American star, in the album Born This Way released in 2011, was too freely inspired by her \"hybridizations\". In addition, the beginning of the video clip of the homonymous song shows Lady Gaga made up and decapitated recalling her \"Woman with head\" executed in 1996. The artist sought $31.7 million in compensation. The plea hearing had been set for July 7, 2016, at the Paris high court. A first verdict was announced in the disadvantage of ORLAN, who then had to pay 20,000 euros to the singer, but the artist decided to appeal. In May 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal dismissed ORLAN by confirming the absence of the parasitic nature of the video clip incriminated. Orlan was ordered to pay 10,000 euros, as costs incurred, to Lady Gaga.\\nShe received the Grand Prix de le-Réputation 2013, organized by Alexia Guggemos in the visual arts category, which rewards the most popular personalities on the internet, alongside Philippe Starck and Yann Arthus-Bertrand\\nSince October 18, 2018, ORLAN is represented in France by the Ceysson & Bénétière Gallery in Paris.\\nIn 2019, she was a member of the jury of the Opline Prize, the first online contemporary art prize.\\nDuring the lockdown linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, she wrote her autobiography, \\'\"Strip-Tease : tout sur ma vie, tout sur mon art\" published by Gallimard in the collection Témoins de l\\'Art.\\nOn November 29, 2021, she was decorated with the National Order of the Legion of Honor to the rank of Knight by the Minister of Culture Roselyne Bachelot.\\n\\n\\n=== The Reincarnation of Sainte- ORLAN ===\\nIn 1990, Orlan began The Reincarnation of Sainte- ORLAN. It involved a series of plastic surgeries through which the artist transformed herself into elements from famous paintings and sculptures of women. As a part of her \"Carnal Art\" manifesto, these works were filmed and broadcast in institutions throughout the world, such as the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Sandra Gehring Gallery in New York.\\nORLAN picked these characters, \"not for the canons of beauty they represent... but rather on account of the stories associated with them.\"\\n\\nORLAN defines cosmetic surgery as \"nomadic, mutant, shifting, differing.\" ORLAN has stated, \"my work is a struggle against the innate, the inexorable, the programmed, Nature, DNA (which is our direct rival as far as artists of representation are concerned), and God!\". In an interview with Acne Paper, ORLAN stated:I can observe my own body cut open, without suffering!... I see myself all the way down to my entrails; a new mirror stage... I can see to the heart of my lover; his splendid design has nothing to do with sickly sentimentalities... Darling, I love your spleen; I love your liver; I adore your pancreas, and the line of your femur excites me.\" (from Carnal Art manifesto)\\n\"Sainte ORLAN\" came from a character that I created for \"Le baiser de l\\'artiste\" from a text called \"Facing a society of mothers and merchants.\" The first line of this text was: \"At the bottom of the cross were two women, Maria and Maria Magdalena.\" These are two inevitable stereotypes of women that are hard to avoid: the mother and the prostitute. In \"Le baiser de l\\'artiste\" there were two faces. One was Saint ORLAN, a cutout picture of me dressed as Madonna glued onto wood. One could buy a five francs church candle and I was sitting on the other side behind the mock-up of the vending machine. One could buy a French kiss from me for the same amount of money one could buy a candle. The idea was to play on the ambivalence of the woman figure and the desire of both men and women towards those biblical and social stereotypes.\\n\\nBeing showcased in the Paris International Contemporary Art Fair. \\n\\n\\n== In the 2000s ==\\nIn 2001, ORLAN orchestrated a series of filmic posters, \"Le Plan du Film,\" with various artists and writers.\\nShe collaborated in 2008 with the Symbiotica laboratory in Australia, resulting in the bio-art installation \"The Harlequin\\'s Coat.\"Part of ORLAN\\'s ongoing work includes \"Suture/Hybridize/Recycle,\" a generative and collaborative series of clothing made from ORLAN\\'s wardrobe and focusing on suture: the deconstruction of past clothing reconstructed into new clothing that highlights the sutures.\\nIn June 2013, she filed a complaint against Lady Gaga. For ORLAN, the American star, in the album Born This Way released in 2011 is inspired by the artist without quoting her. The beginning of the video clip of the homonymous song shows Lady Gaga with implants similar to those of ORLAN and the face of Lady Gaga beheaded recalls the work Woman with head created in 1996. Her lawyer was asking for compensation of 31.7 million dollars. The hearing was set for July 7, 2016, at the Tribunal de la Grande Instance de Paris. A first verdict was announced against ORLAN but the artist decided to appeal. In May 2018, the Court of Appeal of Paris rejected ORLAN by confirming the absence of the parasitic nature of the video clip.\\nIt receives the Reputation on line Prize (Grand Prix de le-réputation) in 2013, organized by the art critic Alexia Guggemos, Plastic Arts category, which rewards the most popular personalities on the Internet alongside Phillipe Starck for design and Yann Arthus-Bertrand for photography.\\nIn 2018, ORLAN created a robot in her own image, \" Orlanoïde\", equipped with collective and social artificial intelligence that speaks with her voice by reading texts from a text generator: presented at the Grand Palais, for the exhibition \"Artists and Robots\", the robot is also part of a performance entitled \"Electronic and verbal striptease\" and also benefits from a motion generator. It is a work in progress, currently, the developers of the Art and science gallery in Dublin are developing other capacities.\\nIn 2019, she was honored with the special prize of WOMAN OF THE YEAR, awarded by the Prince of Monte Carlo.\\nOrlan is also appointed Professor Emeritus of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma.\\nDuring the confinement in 2020, Orlan wrote her autobiography Strip-tease : tout sur ma vie, tout sur mon art published by Gallimard on the 3rd of June, 2021.\\nOn November 29, 2021, she was decorated with the National Order of the Legion of Honor with the rank of Knight by the Minister of Culture Roselyne Bachelot\\nShe is represented in France by the Ceysson & Bénétière Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Recent works ===\\nLe Slow de l\\'artiste, 2021\\nORLAN et l\\' Orlanoïde strip-tease artistique électronique et verbal,2018, Exhibition Artistes et robots, Grand Palais, Paris, France: a humanoid in the image of Orlan (but exposing its mechanical armature) sings or speaks using her voice, dances, using information gathered collectively and in conjunction with deep learning algorithms\\nTangible Striptease en Nanoséquences, 2016, Centre des Arts, Enghien-les-Bains and Université Paris Diderot, Paris, France : ORLAN, in collaboration with Mael Le Mée, created a performance in which the ORLAN-corps, in the form of biological samples and cultures of its microbiota, circulated among the spectators\\nExpérimentale mise en jeu, 2015: video game in which the viewer, by means of MYOS bracelets, controls an avatar of the artist. The aim of the character is to restore works that have been destroyed, with each progression in the restoration, the central character builds his humanity and finally, the ruined landscape is rebuilt. This game is based on the idea that \"killing is not playing\"\\nSelf-hybridations Masques de l\\'Opéra de Pékin, Facing Design et réalité augmentée, 2014 : the artist\\'s most recent series of self-hybridizations in which she hybridizes her face with typical Pekin Opera masks. This interactive photographic series uses augmented reality. The viewer, by scanning the work as a QR code, sees appear on his screen an avatar of Orlan performing acrobatics of the Pekin Opera, he can then photograph himself or other spectators with the avatar share and share his pictures online\\nLa liberté en écorchée, 2013 : this 3D video shows the artist\\'s body modeled in 3D. It is a manifesto insisting both on the \"flayed\" nature of artists and on his responsibility concerning this notion of freedom to be constantly defended.\\nRobes sans corps, Sculptures de plis, 2010: sculptures of drapery without body, in gold leaf resin or platinum\\n\\n\\n=== Emblematic works ===\\nSome of her emblematic works include : \\n\\nORLAN accouche d\\'elle-m\\'aime, 1964: in this black and white photography, ORLAN gives birth to a character like an inert and androgynous body, neither man nor woman. This work symbolizes the artist\\'s desire to give birth to herself, to invent a new identity. This series is part of the Corps-sculptures. It is created a few months after an abortion of the artist.\\nMesuRages (1974-2011): the name chosen for this series of actions insists on the word \"Rage\" since the artist refuses to play the role that one wants to impose on her. Using the \" ORLAN-body\", a new unit of measurement, the artist will measure St. Peter\\'s Square in Rome, Chateaubriand Street in Nice, the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris, the St. Peter\\'s Museum in Lyon, the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp and the Guggenheim Museum in New-York. On the Place Saint-Lambert in Liège, Orlan\\'s \"MesuRage\" takes on a political character, since the artist was invited by an association campaigning for the defense of this square, which is threatened by an urban planning operation.\\nLe Baiser de l\\'artiste: a 1977 performance at the Grand Palais, where the International Contemporary Art Fair was taking place. Seated behind life-size photography of her naked bust, treated like an ATM, ORLAN calls out to the public: \"Come closer, come to my pedestal, that of the myths: the mother, the whore, the artist\" . On a black platform, she monetizes her kisses, while to her right another photographic silhouette pasted on wood shows her as a Virgin to whom one can, for the same price, offer a candle. This action caused a great scandal and was highly publicized. This work was exhibited in 2008 in the exhibition WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington D.C, the Vancouver Art Gallery, MOCA Gefen in Los Angeles, and the P.S 1 Contemporary Art Center in New York.\\nLe Drapé-le Baroque (1979-1986): this series of photographs constitutes a complex and rather suggestive iconography on the spiritual level, with characters inspired by Christian iconographies, such as Saint ORLAN, the white virgin, and the black virgin. These works are a continuation of ORLAN\\'s quest for female identity, her critique of religious pressures and her staging of the Baroque.\\nL’Origine de la guerre: in 1989, is a counterpart to Gustave Courbet\\'s famous painting, The Origin of the World. A phallus spread legs with head, arms, and legs cut off, taking up and \"transvestising\" Courbet\\'s feminine iconography, illustrates the title in a gesture that does not detract from feminism.\\nLa Réincarnation de sainte ORLAN: begun in 1990, or Images / Nouvelles Images, comprises a series of nine cosmetic surgery operations/performances, during which ORLAN makes her flesh the material of her work and takes as its basis the representations of women in Western art. Each of ORLAN\\'s carefully planned and executed operations/performances are staged and controlled by the artist. Through these interventions, she \"put the figure on her face.\" She chooses the literalness of the performance to speak about the violence done to the body, in particular to women\\'s bodies, and to question the models of beauty. For example, ORLAN had implants usually put to raise the cheekbones on each side of the forehead, creating two horn-like bumps on the temples.\\nOmniprésence(November 1993): ORLAN meets Dr. Marjorie Cramer in New York, a surgeon who accepts the artistic and feminist objectives of her project: the radical transformation of her face by implants in the temples. The objective is to divert plastic surgery from its usual objectives and to question the standards of beauty. This operation/performance is broadcast live in her exhibition at the Sandra Gering Gallery in New York, at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, at the Mac Luhan Center in Toronto, at the Banff Multimedia Center, and on CNN.\\nCeci est mon corps…Ceci est mon logiciel… is a performance conference on May 30, 1990, accompanied by a book and a CD-Rom. She develops there the Manifesto of the carnal art (Manifeste de l\\'art charnel)\\nLe plan du film (2001): following the example of Jean-Luc Godard, who spoke of the production of a \"film in reverse\", ORLAN starts from the creation of cinema posters to then define the casting, the script, a promotional evening at the Fondation Cartier for contemporary art, a soundtrack by the group Tanger, the trailer of the film, the producer. She exhibited all of this work at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 at the Hôtel Martinez.\\nSelf-hybridizations(1998-2002): digital images featuring the artist in physical metamorphoses (virtual this time) questioning the canons of beauty of other civilizations (Amerindian, pre-Columbian and African). Using computer processes, Orlan transforms her image in a way that brings her closer to pre-Columbian (such as the deformation of the Mayan skull), African, Egyptian, Amerindian, and Merovingian cultural traditions. This work is in the continuity of her previous works where she denounced the social pressures that our society inflicts on the body and appearance. Here she stages the absurdity of these criteria, which are opposed according to the time or the civilization in which one lives. The image of the ideal body becomes completely abstract and ironic.\\nLe Manteau d\\'Arlequin: it is an installation mixing art and biotechnologies, created with living cells of Orlan, cells of different origins, and even animal cells. This work is inspired by Michel Serres\\' text, Laïcité, placed as a preface to his book Le Tiers Instruit. Michel Serres uses the figure of the Harlequin as a metaphor for crossing, accepting the other, conjunction, intersection. Le Manteau d\\'Arlequin develops and continues to explore the idea of crossing using the more carnal medium of skin. It also questions the relationship between biotechnology and artistic culture. This installation has been presented in Perth, Liverpool, Luxembourg.\\nHer ultimate work would be to place her mummified body in a museum, but it seems that the artist has not yet found a public collection to display this work.\\nORLAN\\'s works can be found in the collections of various museums, including the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Maison européenne de la photographie, Fonds nation d\\'art contemporain, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Getty Center, the National Museum of Art, Osaka, the Museum of Modern Art, as well as various private collections, including the François Pinault Collection.\\n\\n\\n== Galleries and collections ==\\n\\n\\n=== Galleries ===\\nOrlan is represented by various galleries internationally:\\n\\nGallery Ceysson & Bénétière, Paris, New-York, Luxembourg, Saint-Étienne, Genève\\nGallery Ace, Los Angeles, États-Unis ;\\nGallery Stux, New York, États-Unis ;\\nGallery Michel Rein, Paris, France ;\\nGallery Prometeo, Milan, Italie ;\\nGallery Spaivisor, Valence, Espagne\\nGallery Sejul, Séoul, Corée du Sud\\n\\n\\n=== Public collections ===\\nEurope\\n\\nNational Museum of Modern Art, Paris, France.\\nEuropean House of Photography, Paris, France.\\nFrench Museum of Photography, Bièvres, France.\\nDepartmental Museum of Ancient and Contemporary Art, Épinal, France.\\nMuseum of the New World, La Rochelle, France.\\nMuseum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Saint-Étienne, Saint-Étienne, France.\\nMuseum of Arts, Nantes, France.\\nNational Fund for Contemporary Art, Puteaux, France.\\nArt library, La Réunion, France.\\nRegional Funds for Contemporary Art in France:\\nFRAC Île-de-France;\\nFRAC Pays-de-la-Loire;\\nFRAC Rhône-Alpes;\\nFRAC Basse-Normandie.\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art of Lyon, Lyon, France.\\nMuseum of Art, Lodz, Poland.\\nNorth America\\n\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York, États-Unis.\\nMusée d\\'Art du comté de Los Angeles, Los Angeles, États-Unis.\\nMusée d\\'Art contemporain de Los Angeles, Los Angeles, États-Unis.\\nJ.

              "  'Deborah Kass (born 1952) is an American artist whose work explores the intersection of pop culture, art history, and the construction of self. Deborah Kass works in mixed media, and is most recognized for her paintings, prints, photography, sculptures and neon lighting installations. Kass\\'s early work mimics and reworks signature styles of iconic male artists of the 20th century including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Ed Ruscha.\\nKass\\'s technique of appropriation is a critical commentary on the intersection of social power relations, identity politics, and the historically dominant position of male artists in the art world.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nDeborah Kass was born in 1952 in San Antonio, Texas.  Her grandparents were from Belarus and Ukraine, first generation Jewish immigrants to New York. Kass\\'s parents were from the Bronx and Queens, New York. Her father did two years in the U.S. Air Force on base in San Antonio until the family returned to the suburbs of Long Island, New York, where Kass grew up. Kass’s mother was a substitute teacher at the Rockville Centre public schools and her father was a dentist and amateur jazz musician.\\nAt age 14, Kass began taking drawing classes at The Art Students League in New York City which she funded with money she made babysitting. In the afternoons, she would go to theater on and off Broadway, often sneaking for the second act. During her high school years, she would take her time in the city to visit the Museum of Modern Art, where she would be exposed to the works of post-war artists like Frank Stella and Willem De Kooning. At age 17, Stella’s retrospective exhibition inspired Kass to become an artist as she observed and understood the logic in his progression of works and the motivation behind his creative decisions.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nKass received her BFA in Painting at Carnegie Mellon University (the alma mater of artist Andy Warhol), and studied at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program Here, she created her first work of appropriation, Ophelia’s Death After Delacroix, a six by eight foot rendition of a small sketch by the French Romantic artist, Eugène Delacroix.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nAt the same time Neo-Expressionism was being helmed by white men in the late Reagan years, women were just beginning to create a stake in the game for critical works. “The Photo Girls” consisted of artists like Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, and Barbara Kruger. Kass felt that content of these works connected those of the post-war abstract painters of the mid-70s including Elizabeth Murray, Pat Steir, and Susan Rothenberg. All of these artists critically explored art in terms of new subjectivities from their points-of-view as women. Kass took from these artists the ideas of cultural and media critique, inspiring her Art History Paintings.\\nKass is most famous for her “Decade of Warhol,” in which she appropriated various works by the pop artist, Andy Warhol. She used Warhol’s visual language to comment on the absence of women in art history at the same time that Women’s Studies began to emerge in academia. Reading texts on subjectivity, objectivity, specificity, and gender fluidity by theorists like Judith Butler and Eve Sedgewick, Kass became literate in ideas surrounding identity. She engaged with art history through the lens of feminism, because of this theory which “The Photo Girls” drew upon.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nKass\\'s work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art; Whitney Museum of American Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; Jewish Museum (New York); Museum of Fine Art, Boston; Cincinnati Museum of Art; New Orleans Museum; National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; Fogg Museum, Harvard Art Museums; and Weatherspoon Museum, among others.\\nIn 2012 Kass\\'s work was the subject of a mid-career retrospective Deborah Kass, Before and Happily Ever After at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA. An accompanying catalogue published by Skira Rizzoli, included essays by noted art historians Griselda Pollock, Irving Sandler, Robert Storr, Eric C. Shiner and writers and filmmakers Lisa Leibmann, Brooks Adams, and John Waters.\\nKass\\'s work has been shown at international private and public venues including at the Venice Biennale, the Istanbul Biennale, the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, the Museum of Modern Art, The Jewish Museum, New York, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A survey show, Deborah Kass, The Warhol Project traveled across the country from 1999–2001. She is a Senior Critic in the Yale University M.F.A. Painting Program.\\nKass\\'s later paintings often borrow their titles from song lyrics. Her series feel good paintings for feel bad times, incorporates lyrics borrowed from The Great American Songbook, which address history, power, and gender relations that resonate with Kass\\'s themes in her own work.\\n\\n\\n=== Art History Paintings 1989–1992 ===\\nIn Kass\\'s first significant body of work, the Art History Paintings, she combined frames lifted from Disney cartoons with slices of painting from Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock, and other contemporary sources. Establishing appropriation as her primary mode of working, these early paintings also introduced many of the central concerns of her work to the present.  Before and Happily Ever After, for example, coupled Andy Warhol’s painting of an advertisement for a nose job with a movie still of Cinderella fitting her foot into her glass slipper, touching on notions of Americanism and identity in popular culture. The Art History Paintings series engages critically with the history of politics and art making, especially exploring the power relationship of men and women in society. Deborah Kass\\'s work reveals a personal relationship she shares with particular artworks, songs and personalities, many of which are referenced directly in her paintings.\\n\\n\\n=== The Warhol Project 1992–2000 ===\\nIn 1992, Kass began The Warhol Project.  Beginning in the 1960s, Andy Warhol’s paintings employed mass production through screen-printing to depict iconic American products and celebrities. Using Warhol’s stylistic language to represent significant women in art, Kass turned Warhol’s relationship to popular culture on its head by replacing them with subjects of her own cultural interests. She painted artists and art historians that were her heroes including Cindy Sherman, Elizabeth Murray, and Linda Nochlin. Drawing upon her childhood nostalgia, the Jewish Jackie series depicts actress Barbra Streisand, a celebrity with whom she closely identifies, replacing Warhol\\'s prints of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Marilyn Monroe. Her My Elvis series likewise speaks to gender and ethnic identity by replacing Warhol\\'s Elvis with Barbra Streisand from Yentl: a 1983 film in which Streisand plays a Jewish woman who dresses and lives as a man in order to receive an education in the Talmudic Law. Kass\\'s Self Portraits as Warhol further deteriorates the idea of rigid gender norms and increasingly identifies the artist with Warhol. By appropriating Andy Warhol\\'s print Triple Elvis and replacing Elvis Presley with Barbara Streisand’s Yentl, Kass is able to identify herself with history’s icons, creating a history with powerful women as subjects of art. The work embodies her concerns surrounding gender representation, advocates for a feminist revision of art, and directly challenges the tradition of patriarchy.\\n\\n\\n==== America’s Most Wanted ====\\nAmerica\\'s Most Wanted is a series of enlarged black-and-white screen prints of fake police mug shots. The collection of prints from 1998–1999 is a late-1990s update of Andy Warhol’s 1964 work 13 Most Wanted Men, which featured the most wanted criminals of 1962. The “criminals” are identified in titles only by first name and surname initial, but in reality the criminals depicted are individuals prominent in today\\'s art world. Some of the individuals depicted include Donna De Salvo, deputy director for international initiatives and senior curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem, and Robert Storr, dean of the Yale School of Art. Kass\\'s subjects weren’t criminals. Through this interpretation, Kass show\\'s how they are wanted by aspirants for their ability to elevate artists’ careers.\\nThe series explores the themes of authorship and the gaze, at the same time problematizing certain connotations within the art world.\\n\\n\\n=== Feel Good Paintings for Feel Bad Times 2002–ongoing ===\\nIn 2002, Kass began a new body of work, feel good paintings for feel bad times, inspired, in part, by her reaction to the Bush administration. These works combine stylistic devices from a wide variety of post-war painting, including Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, and Ed Ruscha, along with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Laura Nyro, and Sylvester, among others, pulling from popular music, Broadway show tunes, the Great American Songbook, Yiddish, and film. The paintings view American art and culture of the last century through the lens of that time period\\'s outpouring of creativity that was the result of post-war optimism, a burgeoning middle class, and democratic values.  Responding to the uncertain political and ecological climate of the new century in which they have been made, Kass\\'s work looks back on the 20th century critically and simultaneously with great nostalgia, throwing the present into high relief.  Drawing, as always, from the divergent realms of art history, popular culture, political realities, and her own political and philosophical reflection, the artist continues into the present the explorations that have characterized her paintings since the 1980s in these new hybrid textual and visual works.\\n\\n\\n=== OY/YO ===\\nIn 2015, Two Tree Management Art in Dumbo commissioned of a monumentally scaled installation of OY/YO for the Brooklyn Bridge Park. The sculpture, measuring 8×17×5 ft., consists of big yellow aluminum letters, was installed on the waterfront and was visible from the Manhattan. It spells “YO” against the backdrop of Brooklyn. The flip side, for those gazing at Manhattan, reads “OY.” An article and photo appeared on the front page of the New York Times 3 days after its installation in the park. An instant icon, OY/YO stayed at that site for 10 months where it became a tourist destination, a favorite spot for wedding, graduation, class photos and countless selfies. After its stay in Dumbo it moved to the ferry stop at North 6th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for a year, where it greeted ferry riders.\\nSince 2011, OY/YO has been a reoccurring motif in Deborah Kass\\'s work in the form of paintings, prints, and tabletop sculptures. Kass first created “OY” as a painting riffing on Edward Ruscha’s 1962 Pop canvas, “OOF.” She later painted “YO” as a diptych that nodded to Picasso\\'s 1901 self-portrait, “Yo Picasso” (“I, Picasso”). OY/YO is now installed in front of the Brooklyn Museum. Another arrived at Stanford University in front of the Cantor Arts Center late 2019.\\nA large edition of OY/YO was acquired by the Jewish Museum in New York in 2017 and is on view in the exhibition Scenes from the Collection.\\n\\n\\n=== No Kidding ===\\nOn December 9, 2015 Deborah Kass introduced her new paintings that incorporated neon lights in an exhibition at Paul Kasmin Gallery entitled \"No Kidding\" in Chelsea, New York. The exhibition was an extension of her Feel Good Paintings for Feel Bad Times, but it sets a darker, tougher tone as she reflects on contemporary issues such as global warming, institutional racism, political brutality, gun violence, and attacks on women\\'s health, through the lens of minimalism and grief. The series is ongoing.\\n\\n\\n=== Louises ===\\nDeborah Kass has spoken about creating an “ode to the great Louises,” a space dedicated to her works inspired by famous Louise’s which she would call the “Louise Suite.” The earliest of these odes is “Sing Out Louise,” a 2002 oil on linen painting from her Feel Good Paintings Feel Bad Times collection. “Sing out Louise” is driven by her fondness for Rosalind Russel and the fact Kass feels it is her time to “Sing Out”. “After Louise Bourgeois” is a 2010 sculpture made of neon and transformers on powder-coated aluminum monolith; it is a spiraling neon light with a phrase inspired by French-American artist Louise Bourgeois. The neon installation reads “A woman has no place in the art world unless she proves over and over again that she won’t be eliminated.” Kass changed the quote slightly to better represent her beliefs but it was derived from Bourgeois. “After Louise Nevelson” is a 2020 spiraling neon work of art that reads \"Anger? I\\'d be dead without my anger\" a quote from American sculptor, Louise Nevelson.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nDeborah Kass married artist Patricia Anne Cronin in July 2011. Cronin is a professor of art at Brooklyn College. She graduated from Rhode Island College, got and MFA in painting from Brooklyn College, and studied at both the Yale Summer School of Art and Music and the Skowhegan School of Art.\\n\\n\\n== Award and Grants ==\\nNew York Foundation for the Arts, inducted into NYFA Hall of Fame (2014)\\nArt Matters Inc.

              "  'Peter Forakis (September 22, 1927 – November 26, 2009) was an American artist and professor. He was known as an abstract geometric sculptor.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nPeter Forakis was born on September 22, 1927, in Hanna, Wyoming. The son of a Greek immigrant, he grew up on the Wyoming prairie until the age of 10 when his family moved to Oakland, California. Eventually they settled in Modesto, California.\\nForakis was in the Merchant Marines from 1945 to 1950. He served in the United States Military in Korea and Japan from 1951 to 1953. He earned his B.F.A.degree in 1957 at the California School of Fine Arts (now San Francisco Art Institute).\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nIn 1955, Forakis created the poster for the Six Gallery reading by Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen, MCed by Kenneth Rexroth.\\nIn 1958, Forakis moved to New York City. It was during this time in New York in the late 1950s–1960s that Forakis emerged as a prominent member of the art world, and, along with artists Mark di Suvero, Edwin Ruda, Dean Fleming, Robert Grosvenor, Anthony Magar, Tamara Melcher, Forrest “Frosty” Myers, David Novros, and Leo Valledor, he founded the Park Place Gallery (1963–1967), a unique artists’ co-op space. Park Place became the prototype for experimental art spaces of the 1970s.\\nForakis was a ceaseless experimenter and was conducting his own research during the Park Place Gallery time period.  Although he began as a painter, his paintings became sculpture. His work quickly evolved in a 3-dimensional direction, with a seminal series of “3D paintings” (1959–1962) consisting of brightly painted abstract constructions made from mostly found timber which literally “came off the wall.”  Sadly, few of these works remain. Forakis became fascinated by geometry and his focus became sculptural. San Francisco Chronicle Art critic Kenneth Baker credits Forakis as the “originator of geometry-based sculpture from the 60s”. In an article by Joanne Dickson titled “Profile: Peter Forakis” in the Winter 1981 edition of Ocular Magazine Forakis said, “Geometry…is a natural law that exists not only in my thinking and my blood, bones, and marrow, but in the universe and all its matter.” \\nForakis embarked on his lifelong exploration of the cube and hypercube along with Four-Dimensional theories.  Since the late 1950s Peter Forakis has been a prolific producer of sculpture based on geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, octahedrons and rhomboids. Some of his best known pieces include Daedules & Icarus (1963), Magic Box (1966) and Hyper Cube, 1967 (Walker Art Center).\\nIn 1967 Forakis received his first monumental scale commission.  Atlanta Gateway, one of the largest existing works of modern sculpture anywhere measuring 100 feet by 200 feet by 100 feet of tubular steel, spans a major traffic artery in Atlanta, Georgia’s Southwest Industrial Park.\\nBy the early 1970s Forakis had begun experimenting with his “slots” technique, one of his signature achievements notable both as a unique language of examining geometry and for fabricating large scale works in steel without welding. Cutting slots into steel and sliding sheets together allowed large sculptures to be assembled using only gravity and the weight of the material. Archimedes Cube, (series, beginning in 1968) a signature piece for Forakis, has no welds, only slots. Of his monumental slotted sculptures are Sokar: the Egyptian Key (1974), and Jack London (1982) owned by the Oakland Museum and located in the Oakland Estuary, Oakland, California.\\nHe  exhibited his work in major sculpture exhibitions in museums including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) 1967 American Sculpture of the Sixties exhibition. His work has been seen on both coasts, across the US, and in Europe and Asia. He also won numerous grants.\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\nForakis died on November 26, 2009, in Petaluma, California.\\n\\n\\n== Teaching ==\\n1961-65\\tBrooklyn Museum Art School\\n1965\\tCarnegie Technical School of Architecture and Art\\n1966\\tPennsylvania State University\\n1967\\tCooper Union\\n1968-77\\tWindham College, Putney, Vermont (Chairman, Art Department) 1972-74\\n1978\\tSchool of Visual Arts, New York City\\n1980\\tUniversity of California, Berkeley\\n1980-82\\tUniversity of Kentucky\\n\\n\\n== Happenings ==\\n1961\\tWoodstock, New York\\n1962\\tBridgehampton, New York\\n1962 \\tErgo Suits, Carnival and Art Fair, with Allan Kaprow, Woodstock, New York\\n1963\\tWelfare Island, New York\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nGrope Magazine, 1/1 (January 1964); 2/2 (1966)\\nARTnews, May 1960; April 1961; May 1961; November 1961; September 1962; Summer 1966; November 1966; January 1964; January 1969 (reproduction); December 1970\\nDavid Bourdon, E-MC 2,\\nARTnews, January 1966\\nArts Magazine, September 1963; March 1967 (reproduction); November 1967; November 1962; March 1964; December 1966\\nEdwin Ruda, Park Place: 1963-1967, Arts Magazine, November 1967\\nArt in America, December 1964; January 1970; May 1970; November 1970; September 1970\\nCarter Ratcliff, Art in America, March 1978\\nArtforum, September 1970; April 1970; October 1970 (reproductions); January 1978\\nLawrence Alloway, Peter Forakis, Artforum, January 1968\\nArts Magazine, May 1978\\nHenderson, Linda \"Reimagining Space The Park Place Gallery Group in 1960s New York\" Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas, Austin, 2009\\nHumblet, Claudine \"La Nouvelle Abstraction Americaine 1950-1970\" Skira, 2003\\nDi Suvero, Mark, forward; Charles Ginnever; Atkinson, D.

              "  'Vanessa Beecroft (born April 25, 1969) is an Italian-born American contemporary performance artist; she also works with photography, video art, sculpture, and painting. Many of her works have made use of professional models, sometimes in large numbers and sometimes naked or nearly so, to stage tableaux vivants. She works in the United States, and is based in Los Angeles as of 2009. Her early work was focused on gender and appeared to be autobiographical; her later work is focused on race. Starting in 2008 she began working with Kanye West on collaborations and commercial projects.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nVanessa Beecroft was born April 25, 1969, in Genoa, Italy and raised in Santa Margherita Ligure and Malcesine near Lake Garda. Both of her parents were teachers; she was born to an Italian mother, Maria Luisa and a British father, Andrew Beecroft. After she was born, her family briefly moved to Holland Park, west London.\\nHer parents divorced when she was three years old and she did not see her father or her younger brother again until she was 15 years old. Her mother raised Beecroft alone in a village in Italy in a strict vegan household with no cars, no television, and no phone. In childhood, she was hospitalized for overeating specific foods she thought would cleanse her system, and she struggled with an eating disorder.\\nFrom 1988 to 1993 she attended Brera Academy in Milan, Italy. Her first art exhibition VB01 (1993) was in a gallery in Milan and featured a performance with other female students from Brera Academy wearing Beecroft\\'s clothing, and sharing Beecroft\\'s \"Book of Food\", a diary documenting her food consumption from 1985 and 1993. The \"Book of Food\" documented Beecroft\\'s bulimic eating habits and was referenced again in her later work, but it was separate from the performances.\\nShe moved to the United States in 1996, at the invitation of art dealer Jeffrey Deitch, settling in New York City.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nSome common themes in the work include self discipline (of the models), voyeurism, and power relationships. Beecroft\\'s artwork is often performance or installation-based with live human figures, but she also documents the performances with photography and video; this work is in many public museum and art collections including the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Van Abbemuseum, amongst others.\\n\\n\\n=== VB performances (1993–present) ===\\nMany of the VB performances were documented in the Dave Hickey book VB 08-36: Vanessa Beecroft Performances (2000), and in Emily L. Newman\\'s book Female Body Image in Contemporary Art: Dieting, Eating Disorders, Self-Harm, and Fatness (2018).\\nThe performances were titled sequentially. Strict rules were imposed on the models\\' behavior during the performances; they were instructed not to engage with the audience. Models were uniformed, nude, or barely clothed and were required to stand for hours, often in tall high heels without movement or eye contact. Beecroft always used tall, thin, young models who she referred to as \"girls\", regardless of their age. In later work, Beecroft would use designer accessories or shoes as props for the models.\\n\\nVB02, VB03, VB04, and VB08 took place in 1994 and featured live girl models all dressed in bright red wigs (an exaggerated representation of Beecroft\\'s own hair color) and white underwear. VB08 (1994) performance took place at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, New York, using live female models, pantyhose, and bright red wigs.\\nVB25 (1996) performance took place at Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Netherlands, with seven identical-looking young women wearing fake eyelashes and red nail polish, each dressed in a polo-neck pullover, white underwear, tights, and high heels.\\nVB35: Show (1998) took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York; twenty women stood in the museum for two hours in a circular arrangement in order to mirror the architecture. Fifteen of the women wore rhinestone-decorated bikinis designed by Tom Ford, and five of the women were nude. This was a larger event than some of her prior work and made international news. Casting was done by Jennifer Starr, and the production was done by Yvonne Force Villareal, and Doreen Remen.\\nVB45 (2004) took place at Terminal 5 of the John F. Kennedy Airport with 36 young women standing in formation in the sunken waiting area, wearing only Afro wigs, black body paint, and silver shackles on their ankles.\\nVB51 (2002) was her first filmed performance, it took place in Schloss Vinsebeck, Stenheim, Germany. It featured older models in their 60s, including Beecroft\\'s mother, mother-in-law, stepsister, and the actresses Irm Hermann and Hanna Schygulla (both actresses from films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Beecroft\\'s favorite director).\\nVB53 (2004) at the Tepidarium in Giardino dell’Orticultura, Florence, Italy, women were staged in a mound of dirt, as if they were plants.\\nVB55 (2005) featured one hundred women standing still in Berlin\\'s Neue Nationalgalerie for three hours, each woman oiled from the waist up and wearing nothing but a pair of pantyhose.\\nVB61, Still Death! Darfur Still Deaf? (2007), one of Beecroft\\'s most politically-engaged performances, was presented the 52nd Venice Biennale. It involved \"approximately 30 Sudanese women with their skin painted, lying face-down on a white canvas on the ground, simulating dead bodies piled on top of one another\", representing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.\\nVB65 (March 2009) performance at Padiglione d\\'Arte Contemporanea (PAC) in Milan, Italy, featured a \"Last Supper\" of twenty African immigrant men, dressed formally in suits (some without shoes), drinking water, eating chicken and brown bread without cutlery.\\nVB66 (2010) took place at Mercato Ittico di Napoli (the fish market), Naples, Italy with fifty living models, staged on a platform amongst a group of cast body sculptures and body parts, all painted black. It highlighted the relationships among body, sculpture, and an iconographical reference to the nearby ruins of Pompeii.\\nVB67 (2010) performance took place at Studio Nicoli in Carrara, Italy, and again a similar reenactment in a year later, VB70: Marmi (2011) at Lia Rumma gallery in Milan. The models were staged near marble sculpture statues and the stone was in various states including polished, rough, and in blocks and slabs.\\n\\n\\n=== Other work ===\\nIn October 2005, Beecroft staged a three-hour performance on the occasion of the opening of the Louis Vuitton store, \"Espace Louis Vuitton\" on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. For the same event, Beecroft placed models both black and white on the shelves next to Louis Vuitton bags in a \"human alphabet\". In 2007 the Louis Vuitton company apologized to Dutch graphic designer Anthon Beeke for mimicking his \"Naked Ladies Alphabet\" design without his consent.\\nIn 2018, Beecroft and Kim Kardashian collaborated on a series of nude photos of Kardashian that were displayed on social media for the release of Kardashian\\'s perfume, which had a \"Kardashian body-shaped bottle\".\\n\\n\\n== Collaborations with Kanye West ==\\nSince 2008, Beecroft has been collaborating on work with artist Kanye West. They began working together with a listening party at Ace Gallery, Los Angeles for West\\'s music albums 808s and Heartbreaks. In 2010, Beecroft was named creative lead for the Runaway music video. On the Kanye West music tour, the Yeezus Tour (October 2013 – September 2014), Beecroft designed the sets and choreography. Beecroft worked on West\\'s Spike Jonze directed music video for the 2014 song “Only One”. In 2014, Beecroft assembled and built the wedding ceremony of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West .\\nIn February 2015, West embarked on a fashion design career with Yeezy Season 1, under the Adidas label and Beecroft directed the performance presentation. Beecroft went on to work on Yeezy Season 2 (September 2015), Yeezy Season 3 (February 2016), and Yeezy Season 4 (September 2016).\\nBeecroft alleged she was a full-time employee for West until 2016, when her role changed and she became a part-time contractor.\\nIn 2019, she collaborated with West on two opera-based performances, Nebuchadnezzar and Mary.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nHer performance work about gender was often critiqued for being a \"post-feminist statement about fashion or pandering to a corrupted way of seeing\". Photographer Collier Schorr noted, \"Beecroft is interested in the aesthetics of how women look when they are looked at, and her body-conscious projects encourage alienation between model, artist, and audience.\" Beecroft\\'s work with live female nude models in performances often uses a specific type of model, one with an Westernized \"idealization\" of the female body, all of the models appearing uniformly thin, tall, and young. These choices have been criticized as harmful, distorted, and conforming to gender stereotypes.\\nBeecroft has been quoted in an interview in 2016, “I have divided my personality. There is Vanessa Beecroft as a European white female, and then there is Vanessa Beecroft as Kanye, an African-American male.” Her later work deals with race, and she has made a series of racially insensitive remarks in interviews.\\nBeecroft’s failed attempt to adopt Sudanese twins was the topic of the documentary The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins (2008) by Pietra Brettkelly, which was included in the Sundance Film Festival\\'s World Cinema Documentary Competition. The film presents Beecroft as a \"hypocritically self-aware, colossally colonial pomo narcissist\" and chronicles her \"damaging quotes and appalling behavior\" as she attempts to adopt the orphans for use in an art exhibit.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nVanessa Beecroft was previously married to marketer Greg Durkin. They lived in Cold Spring Harbor, New York together for many years. The marriage ended in divorce. Durkin and Beecroft had two sons together (born in 2001 and 2004). Later, she married to photographer Federico Spadoni. Beecroft and Spadoni have one daughter and one son together (born 2009 and 2012).\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Biography ===\\nKampwerth, Karin; Thomas, Kellein; Beecroft, Vanessa (2004).

              "  'Wolf Vostell (14 October 1932 – 3 April 1998) was a German painter and sculptor, considered one of the early adopters of video art and installation art and pioneer of Happenings and Fluxus. Techniques such as blurring and Dé-coll/age are characteristic of his work, as is embedding objects in concrete and the use of television sets in his works. Wolf Vostell was married to the Spanish writer Mercedes Vostell and has two sons, David Vostell and Rafael Vostell.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nWolf Vostell was born in Leverkusen, Germany, and put his artistic ideas into practice from 1950 onwards. In 1953, he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and studied at the Academy of Applied Art in Wuppertal. Vostell created his first Dé-coll/age in 1954. In 1955–1956, he studied at the École Nationale Superieur des Beaux Arts in Paris and in 1957 he attended the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts. Vostell\\'s philosophy was built around the idea that destruction is all around us and it runs through all of the twentieth century. He used the term Dé-coll/age, (in connection with a plane crash) in 1954 to refer to the process of tearing down posters, and for the use of mobile fragments of reality. For Vostell, Dé-coll/age is a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from media.\\nHis first Happening, The Theater is in the Street, took place in Paris in 1958, and incorporated auto parts and a TV. Impressed by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, which he encountered in the electronic studios of the German radio station WDR, he created his electronic TV Dé-coll/age in 1959. This marked the beginning of his dedication to the Fluxus Movement, which he co-founded in 1962. During this period, Vostell was behind many Happenings in New York, Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm among others. In 1962 he participated in the FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik event in Wiesbaden together with Nam June Paik, George Maciunas and other artists. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of Video art and Installation with his work 6-TV-Dé-coll/age shown at the Smolin Gallery in New York, now in the collections of the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. The Smolin Gallery sponsored two innovative Wolf Vostell events on TV; the first, Wolf Vostell and Television Decollage, featured visitors to the gallery who were encouraged to create poster art on the walls. In 1967 his Happening Miss Vietnam dealt with the subject of the Vietnam war. In 1968, he founded Labor e.V., a group that was to investigate acoustic and visual events, together with Mauricio Kagel, and others. In 1978 he met Salvador Dalí, with whom he would later create a joint project with a sculpture from each other in their museums.\\nVostell was the first artist to integrate a television set into a work of art. This installation was created in 1958 under the title The black room and is now part of the collection of the art museum Berlinische Galerie in Berlin. Early works with television sets are Transmigracion I-III from 1958 and Elektronischer Dé-coll/age Happening Raum(Electronic Dé-coll/age Happening Room) an Installation from 1968. In 1974, his first major retrospective took place in the ARC 2 at the Musée d\\'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, an expanded version of which was shown at the Neue Nationalgalerie, in 1974.\\nWolf Vostell\\'s automobile-concrete-sculptures made from cars and concrete are to be found in Cologne Ruhender Verkehr (Stationary traffic) from 1969, Concrete Traffic from 1970 in Chicago, VOAEX (Viaje de (H)ormigón por la Alta Extremadura) from 1976 in the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de Cáceres, Spain and \\nZwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja (Two Concrete Cadillacs in form of the Naked Maja) from 1987 in Berlin.\\nVostell also gained recognition for his drawings and objects, such as images of American B-52 bombers, published under the rubric \"capitalist realism\" and as a result of his inclusion of television sets with his paintings. Nam June Paik and Vostell were both participants in the Fluxus movement and the work of both artists involved a critique of the fetishization of television and the culture of consumption. The catalogue raisonné of his screen prints and posters has been published in the Nouvelles de l\\'estampe by Françoise Woimant and Anne Moeglin-Delcroix in 1982.\\nIn 1992, the town of Cologne honoured Vostell with a major retrospective of his work. His pieces were distributed over 6 exhibition venues: Stadtmuseum Köln, Kunsthalle Köln, Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Schloss Morsbroich Leverkusen and Städtisches Museum Mülheim / Ruhr. Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary Vostell 60 - Rückblick 92 (Vostell 60 - Review 92) was created.\\nVostell\\'s grave is at the Cementerio Civil de la Almudena in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic work ==\\nFrom 1950 on, Vostell implemented his first artistic ideas, in 1953 he began an apprenticeship as a lithographer and attended the Werkkunstschule at the Bergische Universität with Ernst Oberhoff in Wuppertal. On 6 September 1954 in Paris, he found the word décollage (i.e. to lift off, loosen, loosen the glued, separate) on the title page of Le Figaro, which was used in connection with the crash of a Lockheed Super Constellation into the Shannon. Vostell changed the spelling to Dé-coll/age and applied the term to his poster tear-offs and happenings. For Wolf Vostell, Dé-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art.\\nIn 1955/1956 he attended the Parisian École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts and in 1957 the Düsseldorf Art Academy. Vostell\\'s Happening Das Theater ist auf der Straße from 1958 in Paris was the first happening in Europe. His happening Cityrama of 1961 in Cologne was the first happening in Germany. Vostell produced objects with televisions and car parts. Influenced by the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen in the electronic studio of the WDR, electronic TV-Dé-coll/agen were produced in 1959. This marked the beginning of his involvement in the Fluxus movement, which he co-founded in 1962.\\nIn 1959 Vostell founded the Vostell-archive. Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, personal correspondence with companions like Nam June Paik, Joseph Beuys, Dick Higgins, as well as other objects, which documented the work of the artists of his generation. Since the 1990s, Vostell\\'s private library has been part of the archive. His work is documented photographically and is also part of the archive, which has been housed in the \"Museo Vostell Malpartida\" since 2006.\\nVostell initiated further happenings, among others 9-Nein-dé-coll/agen in Wuppertal in 1963, the Happening You in New York in 1964 and others in Berlin, Cologne, Wuppertal and Ulm. In 1963 Wolf Vostell became a pioneer of video art with the installation 6 TV Dé-coll/age in the collection of the Museo Reina Sofía Madrid and with the video Sun in your head. In 1965 he took part in the 24-hour happening at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal. In 1967 he dealt with the Vietnam War in the happening Miss Vietnam. In 1968, in collaboration with the composer Mauricio Kagel and others, he founded Labor e.V., which was to research acoustic and visual events.\\nVostell is regarded as the first artist who integrated a television set into a work of art. This environment from 1958, consisting of three assemblages, entitled Das schwarze Zimmer (German View, Auschwitz Spotlight 568, Treblinka) is part of the collection of the Berlinische Galerie. Early works with televisions are Transmigracion I to III, from 1958, and Elektronischer dé-coll/age Happening Raum, an installation from 1968.\\nSince the 1950s Wolf Vostell has thematized the Holocaust in numerous works. Wolf Vostell did not want to express with his outward appearance that he was Jewish by his appearance he rather carried his values to the outside world and thus directed himself unambiguously against the danger of suppressing or even forgetting the extermination of European Jews by the German National Socialists. With his temple curls, fur hat and caftan, he was a perfect match for the image of the enemy that the propaganda of the Hitler regime had painted as an anti-Semitic stereotype, following the example of the Eastern European Jews. He exaggerated this image by using other attributes, such as ostentatious rings on his fingers and an equally thick cigar, which in slanderous caricatures from the Nazi era had been symbolically given to the \"money-greedy Jewish usurer\".\\n\\n\\n=== First works ===\\nIn 1953, he initially produced traditionally produced works such as Korea and Korea Massacre (both oil on paper), War Crucifixion II (oil on canvas) as well as the watercolors The Couple, Family, Airplane and War Crucifixion. In 1955, he drew a cycle of ink drawings on Peter Schlemihl\\'s miraculous story.\\n\\n\\n=== 1960s ===\\nIn 1962 Vostell participated in the Fluxus manifestation Fluxus: International Festival of Contemporary Music in Wiesbaden and in 1963 in the Fluxus festival Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in Düsseldorf. In 1962 he founded the journal Dé-coll/age - Bulletin of Current Ideas. In 1963 he showed the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room), which is installed in a dark room with black painted walls, in the Galerie Parnass. In 1964 Vostell initiated the Happening In Ulm, around Ulm and around Ulm - in the same year he had his first exhibition participation in the 13th exhibition of the Deutscher Künstlerbund in Berlin. In 1965 the Happenings Berlin 100 Ereignisse and 1967 Miss Vietnam followed. He often took up political and social themes.\\nBetween 1965 and 1969, exhibitions, happenings, multiples and publications were created in collaboration with René Block. In 1968 he created the silkscreen B-52 - instead of bombs. In 1969 - in cooperation with the gallery art intermedia of Helmut Rywelski in Cologne - Vostell created his first car-concrete sculpture Ruhender Verkehr (resting traffic). \\nIn January 1970, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Chicago sponsored a happening in which Vostell encased a 1957 Cadillac in concrete at a parking lot near the museum, creating the work Concrete Traffic (1970). The work was moved via highway to the University of Chicago campus in 1970, where it remained for nearly four decades. The work was restored and moved to the University of Chicago campus in 2016.\\n\\n\\n=== Berlin and Malpartida de Cáceres ===\\nIn 1970 Vostell moved to Berlin. In 1970 he created Heuschrecken, an installation with 20 monitors and a video camera. The installations TV-Schuhe and TEK were created in the same year. In 1973 he created the cycle Mania. 40 works in which Vostell drew on photographs from magazines and glued objects onto the photographs. In 1973 he created the installations Auto Fieber und Energie. 1976 Vostell founded the Museo Vostell Malpartida in Malpartida de Cáceres. In 1974 he realized the happening Strawberries in Berlin.\\nFrom 1975 onwards, he worked on Spanish themes such as the paintings in the Extremadura cycle, the 1976 cycle El muerto que tiene sed (The Thirsty Dead Man) or 1985 El entierro de la Sardina (The Burial of the Sardine). In the 1980s he created the installation The Winds, the painting The Battle of Anghiari from 1982, a reminiscence of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s painting of the same name Battle of Anghiari, the cycle Milonga from 1985, and the Tauromaqie with BMW part from 1988.\\nIn the 1980s, he proposed a joint project with Salvador Dalí whom he met in 1978. This was realized as one of Dalí\\'s last projects in 1988, shortly before his death. Vostell carried out a work of Dalí, which Dalí had already conceived in the 1920s. El fin de Parzival (the end of the Parzival) consists of 20 motorcycles of the Guardia Civil from the time of the Franco regime, five of which are fastened on top of each other and backed by the music of Richard Wagner\\'s opera Parzival. Initially, Dalí intended to use bicycles. This addition was made by Vostell. In return, Wolf Vostell installed 1988 the sculpture TV-Obelisk (1979) in the Teatre-Museu in Figueres with 14 TV sets and Dalí completed the sculpture with a woman\\'s head on the top, which he created. Inside the woman\\'s head is a video camera that records images of the sky, which are transmitted to the TV sets.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nIn Berlin, he created large-format paintings such as the Triptych Berlin from 1990, the cycle Weinende from 1992 and Weinende Hommage an Anne Frank. Bronze sculptures like Berlinerin from 1994 in a small edition. Graphic works, sculptures and assemblages such as Arc de Triomphe N°1 from 1993, Ritz from 1998 and multiples such as Berliner Brot from 1995.\\n\\n\\n== Influence on art ==\\n\\n\\n=== Dé-coll/age and blurring ===\\nDuring a stay in Paris in September 1954, Vostell read the word Décollage in a headline of Le Figaro (German translation: \"Untie, loose the glued, separate\"). Vostell changed the spelling for himself. From 1954 on he named his poster tear-offs Dé-coll/age. Later he transferred the term Dé-coll/age to his happenings. For Wolf Vostell the Dé-coll/age became a design principle and a comprehensive concept of art. Ceres from 1960, Coca-Cola, your candidate, Great Session with Da (all pictures from 1961), Wochenspiegel Beatles and Livio from 1966 are examples of Wolf Vostell\\'s Dé-coll/agen.\\nIn the 1960s Vostell worked with the technique of blurring. With a mixture of turpentine and carbon tetrachloride, photographs in magazines can be blurred. The cycle Kleenex from 1962, Kennedy before Corham from 1964, Goethe Today from 1967 and Homage to Henry Ford and Jaqueline Kennedy from 1967 are examples of Wolf Vostell\\'s blurred images. He combined dé-coll/age with blurring like in Jayne Mansfield from 1968 and Marilyn Monroe from 1962 or Hours of fun from 1968.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\nVostell dealt with world political events in his artistic work from the 1950s on. As early as 1958 he thematized the Second World War and the Holocaust in the installation Das schwarze Zimmer (The Black Room). The Korean War and the Vietnam War became themes of his works, as they did with his 1968 blurred Miss America. The assassination of John F. Kennedy and other international political events were the subject of his paintings and assemblages.\\nVostell also thematized domestic political topics of the Federal Republic. The student revolts, the economic miracle and the criticism of capitalism are documented in his works. The Cold War and the Bosnian War are present in his works. Wolf Vostell documented and processed the fall of the Berlin Wall in more than 50 works. From the 6 meter wide triptych 9 November 1989 to smaller works, Vostell created a further cycle of works after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Over the decades a political work was created in Vostell\\'s work.\\n\\n\\n=== Television ===\\nBeginning in 1958 Vostell integrated television sets into his works. Pictures, assemblages, installations and sculptures by Wolf Vostell are often designed with TV sets. Most of the time the sets are set to normal program. Thus Wolf Vostell incorporates topicality and current events into his works.\\n\\n\\n=== Tauromaquia ===\\nFrom 1976 Vostell travelled regularly between Berlin and Malpartida de Cáceres. During this time he created a series of paintings and drawings in his Spanish studio, which show the theme Tauromaquia. Large-format canvases show bulls, mostly bleeding and torn to shreds. He made assemblages in which he combined painted bull heads with light bulbs, car parts or other objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Concrete, lead, and gold ===\\nFrom the early 1960s on Vostell worked with concrete, which became a kind of distinctive feature of his works. He created sculptures, like his car-concrete sculptures. He also processed the concrete liquid as a color for his paintings and drawings. He also painted with liquid concrete, acrylic paint and charcoal. In his paintings and drawings you can see many times drawn concrete blocks. Human bodies can often be recognized as angular concrete forms. In the 1980s and 1990s he worked with liquid lead. He poured liquid lead over his canvases, combining acrylic paint, liquid lead and liquid concrete. Wolf Vostell also worked with gold leaf, which he applied directly to the canvas.\\nIn his concrete car sculptures, such as Ruhender Verkehr/Stationary Traffic (1969) and Concrete Traffic (1970), Vostell foregrounded these art objects\\' relationship to the everyday. For Vostell, it was important that these concrete car sculptures be placed an urban setting among other, operational cars. Vostell spoke about de-familiarization provoked by unusual modes of encountering everyday objects: \"I show that there are different realities...I take the TV, the same model that the public has at home, and I defamiliarize it, and this is conceivably shocking... The real disturbance is that their well-known objects, their spoon, their lipstick, their status symbols, their cars are used, and therein lies the content... It is (art)work with familiar objects that causes such disturbances in thinking, in consciousness.\"\\n\\n\\n== Wolf Vostell Archive ==\\nIn the 1960s, Vostell founded the Vostell Archive. With great fervour and strict consistency, Wolf Vostell collected photographs, artistic texts, private correspondence with colleagues such as Nam June Paik, Allan Kaprow, Dick Higgins and many others, as well as press cuttings, invitations to exhibitions and events or books and catalogues which document wolf Vostell\\'s work and that of his contemporaries. His private library with more than 6000 books has formed part of the Archive. Wolf Vostell\\'s extensive oeuvre is documented in photographic form and makes up part of the archive. About 50000 documents from four decades make the Vostell Archive a treasure of art history. Since 2005 the archive has been housed in the Museo Vostell Malpartida and is available to art historians, journalists and scholars.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\nKorea Massaker, 1953, Museum Fluxus+, Potsdam\\nZyklus Guadalupe, 1958\\nDas schwarze Zimmer (The black room), 1958, Installation with TV, Berlinische Galerie, Berlin\\nTransmigracion, I-III, 1958, Canvas with TV\\nDas Theater ist auf der Straße (The theater is on the street), 1958, Happening\\nRue de Buci, 1960, Dé-coll/age\\nIhr Kandidat, 1961, Dé-coll/age, Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\\nCoca-Cola,  1961, Dé-coll/age, Ludwig Museum, Köln\\nCityrama, 1961, Happening\\nWochenspiegel Beatles, 1961, Dé-coll/age, Saarlandmuseum\\nMarilyn Monroe, 1962, Dé-coll/age\\nZyklus Kleenex, 1962\\nMarilyn Monroe Idolo, 1963, Dé-coll/age\\n6 TV Dé-coll/age, 1963, Installation, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid\\nSun in your head, 1963, Video\\nYou, 1964, Installation\\nGoethe Heute, 1967, Sprengel Museum Hannover\\nHommage an Henry Ford und Jaqueline Kennedy, 1967, Installation, Ludwig Museum\\nElektronischer Dé-coll/age Happening Raum, 1968, Installation with TV, Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin\\nHours of fun, 1968, Dé-coll/age, Berlinische Galerie, Berlin\\nMiss America, 1968, Ludwig Museum\\nJetzt sind die Deutschen wieder Nr. 1 in Europa, 1968, Germanisches Nationalmuseum\\nB-52 - Lippenstift Bomber, 1968\\nRuhender Verkehr, 1969, Hohenzollernring, Köln\\nConcrete Traffic, 1970, Chicago\\nHeuschrecken, 1970   Museum Moderner Kunst, MUMOK, Vienna\\nAuto-Fieber, 1973, Installation, Museo Vostell Malpartida\\nVOAEX, 1976 \\nDie Winde, 1981\\nDie Steine, 1981\\nTaxistand, 1983\\nMythos Berlin, 1987, Museo Vostell Malpartida\\nZwei Beton-Cadillacs in Form der nackten Maja, 1987, Rathenauplatz, Berlin\\nLa Tortuga, 1988, Marl\\nSchule von Athen, 1988, LVR-LandesMuseum, Bonn\\nTauromaquia mit BMW-Teil, 1988\\nZyklus Der Fall der Berliner Mauer, 1989\\n9.

Under the artistic direction of David Vostell, the documentary film Vostell 60 - Retrospective 92 was produced about this retrospective.\\nSince 1989, the 1969 car-concrete sculpture Resting Traffic, for which Vostell cast an Opel Kapitän in concrete, has stood on the central reservation of the Hohenzollernring in Cologne. Other car-concrete sculptures are Concrete Traffic from 1970 in Chicago, in the Museo Vostell Malpartida V.O.A.E.X. from 1976 and Two Concrete Cadillacs in the shape of the naked Maja in Berlin from 1987.\\n\\n\\n=== Selection of exhibitions and retrospectives ===\\n1966: Pictures, Verwischung, happening notations 1961-1966, Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne\\n1970: happening & fluxus, Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne\\n1974: Retrospective.

              "  'Mona Hatoum (Arabic: منى حاطوم; born 1952) is a British-Palestinian multimedia and installation artist who lives in London.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nMona Hatoum was born in 1952 in Beirut, Lebanon, to Palestinian parents. Although born in Lebanon, Hatoum was ineligible for a Lebanese identity card and does not identify as Lebanese. As she grew up, her family did not support her desire to pursue art. She continued to draw throughout her childhood, though, illustrating her work from poetry and science classes.\\nHatoum studied graphic design at Beirut University College in Lebanon for two years and then began working at an advertising agency. Hatoum was displeased with the advertising work she produced. During a visit to London in 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out and Hatoum was forced into exile.\\nShe stayed in London, training at both the Byam Shaw School of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art (University College, London) between the years 1975 and 1981. In the years since, \"she has traveled extensively and developed a dynamic art practice that explores human struggles related to political conflict, global inequity, and being an outsider.\"\\n\\n\\n== Artwork and themes ==\\nHatoum explores a variety of different subject matter via different theoretical frameworks. Her work can be interpreted as a description of the body, as a commentary on politics, and on gender and difference as she explores the dangers and confines of the domestic world. Her work can also be interpreted through the concept of space as her sculpture and installation work depend on the viewer to inhabit the surrounding space to complete the effect. There are always multiple readings to her work. The physical responses that Hatoum desired to provoke psychological and emotional responses ensures unique and individual reactions from different viewers.\\n\\n\\n=== Early work ===\\nHatoum\\'s early work consisted largely of performance pieces that used a direct physical confrontation with an audience to make a political point. She used this technique as a means of making a direct statement using her own body; the performances often referenced her background and the political situation in Palestine. In her work, she addressed the vulnerability of the individual in relation to the violence inherent in institutional power structures. Her primary point of reference was the human body, sometimes using her own body.\\nOne such example was in her 1985 work, Roadworks, in which Hatoum walked barefoot through the streets of Brixton, with black boots tied behind her ankles, a statement on the surveillance and policing of the predominantly-Afro-Caribbean population after the 1981 Brixton riot/uprising and the 1985 Brixton riot/uprising. About this work, she writes: ‘I found myself in this rare situation of creating work which although personal/autobiographical, had an immediate relevance to the community of people it was addressing. I also found that I was working ‘for’ the people in the streets of Brixton rather than ‘against’ the indifferent, often hostile audience I usually encounter.’ Roadworks was curated as part of the 2023 Women in Revolt Exhibition at Tate Modern. \\n\\n\\n=== Measures of Distance ===\\nCreated in 1988 as a result of a residency at Western Front in Vancouver, Measures of Distance illustrates Hatoum\\'s early themes of family, displacement, and female sexuality.  The video piece itself is fifteen minutes long and consists of intimate, colored photographs of Hatoum\\'s mother showering. Hatoum overlays the photographs with letters that her mother, living in Beirut during the civil war, wrote to Hatoum, living in London. Handwritten in Arabic, the letters make up the video\\'s narration and themes, and speak to the difficulty of sending letters in a time of conflict. Hatoum reads the letters aloud in Arabic and English. The video roots itself in the brief family reunion that occurred in Beirut between Hatoum and her parents in 1981. While primarily about the mother–daughter relationship, in her mother\\'s letters Hatoum\\'s father is mentioned and thus the father–daughter relationship as well as the husband–wife relationship is examined in this video.\\nThe elements of the video—the letters, Hatoum\\'s mother\\'s wish to see her, and mentions of the war by Hatoum\\'s mother—explore how the war in Palestine and the war in Lebanon displaced the identity and the relationships of Hatoum and her family. The video is neither a documentary nor meant to be journalistic. The video critiques stereotypes and remains optimistic, since the narration from the letters is largely positive, except about the distance between the mother and the daughter. Hatoum attempts to recreate the moments when she reunited with her mother in Beirut and when she asked to photograph her in the shower. Instead of directly depicting the Israeli–Palestinian conflict or the Lebanese Civil War, Hatoum shows how the conflicts affected her family\\'s relationships and her identity. Hatoum both distances and draws in Western audiences through her narration in English and Arabic.\\nIn this portrait of a Palestinian woman, Hatoum gives her mother a voice while subverting stereotypes about Arab women. The Tate Modern describes the portrait in the following words: \"It is through the daughter\\'s art-making project that the mother is able to present herself freely, in a form which cements a bond of identity independent of colonial and patriarchal concerns.\" Measures of Distance is one of the few works done by Hatoum that speaks directly to her background. In other works, Hatoum prefers to be more abstract and to leave the work open ended. While not as abstract as many of her other works, the viewer is still forced to work through how to understand the formal elements of the video. They are not easily given by Hatoum, as the narration is here. \"The video transmits the \\'paradoxical state of geographical distance and emotional closeness.\\'\" It underscores her sense of exile and separation caused by war.\\nMeasures of Distance was screened at the London Film Festival, AFI National Video Festival, and the Montreal Women\\'s Film and Video Festival.\\n\\n\\n=== Grater Divide ===\\nMade in 2002, Grater Divide transforms an everyday object, in this case a common kitchen grater, into a 80 in × 76 in × 33 in (203 cm × 193 cm × 84 cm) divider, alluding to political alienation, perhaps caused by Israeli-built walls in Palestinian territory.\\n\\n\\n=== Hot Spot III ===\\nHot Spot III, created in 2009, is a large installation piece of the globe tilted like the Earth and about as tall as a person. The title connects to the theme of political unrest, imagining conflict in one geographical area upsetting the whole world. The globe is made of cage-like steel that glows luminescent red, as though the world is ablaze, flickering quickly, meant to create an energetic environment that mesmerizes the audience. The installation also invokes a feeling of danger with the hot red lighting outlining the continents. Hatoum challenges whether minimalist or surrealist forms can adequately address the world\\'s issues.\\n\\n\\n=== Later work ===\\n\\nIn the late 1980s, Hatoum abandoned performances as politically too direct and instead turned her attention to installations and objects, taking up some of the earlier ideas from her student days at the Slade School of Art in London. From then on, she relied on the kind of interactivity that lets the spectator become involved in the aesthetic experience without making the artist as performer the focus of attention.\\nSince the 1990s, her work has generally shifted from making statements to asking questions. Much more is required of the viewer as performances were replaced by sculptures and installations that required a level of mental and physical interactivity. Her practice has shifted towards site specificity in, for instance, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and Kunsthalle Hamburg.\\nA notable piece exemplifying her turn from performance to physical objects is Keffieh (1993–1999), a scarf woven of human hair that juxtaposes ideas of femininity and religion.\\nAt the end of the 1980s, she began to focus on common domestic objects—including kitchen utensils and house furnishings. T42 (1993–98) is a pair of teacups fused together at the rim.\\n\\n\\n=== The body ===\\nMany of Hatoum\\'s early pieces situate the body as the locus of a network of concerns—political, feminist, and linguistic—thereby eliciting a highly visceral response. One of her pieces, a 1994 video installation called Corps etranger, showed color video images of an endoscopic probe of her body. Corps etranger was originally produced for Centre Georges Pompidou and features a partially enclosed, cylindrical structure that viewers are called to enter. The viewer stands on a circular plate of glass, and video close-up images of internal and external parts of the artist\\'s body. The artist hails the viewer to \"walk around\" the inside of her body through the visual sequence taken on the endoscope and colonoscope, scanning and probing her digestive system. The audio is a recording of a heartbeat and bodily movements.\\nThe artwork of Hatoum investigates the concept of the \\'abjection\\' introduced by the cultural theorist, Julia Kristeva and the uncanny in her works using body hair.\\n\\n\\n=== Politics ===\\nThe political possibilities for the uncanny visual motif are relevant to discussions of Hatoum\\'s work, as the disruption achieved at a psychological level can have broad implications involving power, politics, or individual concerns. The allusiveness attained by her work is not always referencing grand political events, or appealing to a generalized cultural consciousness, but instead to a seemingly unattainable threat that is only possible to address on an individual scale.\\nHatoum has tied her works to other political movements, especially black struggle. In an interview with Michael Archer in 1997, Hatoum said: \"At the beginning it was important to think about the black struggle as a total political struggle. There are common political forces and attitudes that discriminate against people. In the same way as feminism started off with this totalizing concept of \\'sisterhood\\', and then we ended up with many feminisms, if you like. The black struggle became more diversified once the basic issues were established. And blackness here is not to do with the colour of your skin but a political stance.\"\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHatoum\\'s work was featured in a solo exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston in 2015. In May 2016, Tate Modern held a \"comprehensive exploration into 35 years of Hatoum\\'s work in Britain, from her early performance and video works to her sculpture and large-scale installation\" The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas organized a solo exhibition titled \"Mona Hatoum: Terra Infirma\" that was on view from 12 October 2017 to 25 February 2018. This exhibition then traveled to the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and was on view from 6 April to 11 August 2018.\\nIn March 2018, Hatoum was shortlisted for the Hepworth Prize for Sculpture, alongside Michael Dean, Phillip Lai, Magali Reus and Cerith Wyn Evans.  In January 2020, Hatoum was part of Artpace’s exhibit titled Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace. Also in 2020, she received the Julio González award, featuring in a solo exhibition at Institut Valencià d\\'Art Modern in 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2008 – Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts\\n2011 – Joan Miró Prize, Fundació Joan Miró\\n2017 – 10th Hiroshima Art Prize, Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art, Hiroshima\\n2018 – Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon\\n2019 – Praemium Imperiale for the sculpture category, in recognition of her lifetime achievement in the medium.\\n2021 – Julio González Price 2020\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPalestinian art\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nMichael Archer, Guy Brett, and Catherine M.

              "  'Larry Bell (born 1939) is an American contemporary artist and sculptor. He is best known for his glass boxes and large-scaled illusionistic sculptures. He is a grant recipient from, among others, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, and his artworks are found in the collections of many major cultural institutions. He lives and works in Taos, New Mexico, and maintains a studio in Venice, California.\\n\\n\\n== Critical analysis of work ==\\nBell\\'s art addresses the relationship between the art object and its environment through the sculptural and reflective properties of his work. Bell is often associated with Light and Space, a group of mostly West Coast artists whose work is primarily concerned with perceptual experience stemming from the viewer\\'s interaction with their work. This group also includes, among others, artists James Turrell, John McCracken, Peter Alexander, Robert Irwin and Craig Kauffman. On the occasion of the  Tate Gallery\\'s exhibit Three Artists from Los Angeles: Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, Doug Wheeler, Michael Compton wrote the following to describe the effect of Bell\\'s artwork:\\n\\nAt various times and particularly in the 1960s some artists have worked near what could be called the upper limits of perceptions, that is, where the eye is on the point of being overwhelmed by a superabundance of stimulation and is in danger of losing its power to control it... These artists sometimes produce the effect that the threat to our power to resolve what is seen heightens our awareness of the process of seeing...However, the three artists in this show... operate in various ways near the lowest thresholds of visual discrimination. The effect of this is again to cause one to make a considerable effort to discern and so to become conscious of the process of seeing.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois in 1939 and grew up in Los Angeles, California. From 1957 to 1959, he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now part of CalArts) in Los Angeles, with the intention of becoming a Disney animator. He was a student of artists Robert Irwin, Richards Ruben, Robert Chuey, and Emerson Woelffer, and it was at Chouinard where Bell explored abstract painting.\\nHe followed friends like Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ken Price, and Craig Kauffman to the beach. \"He was the first and youngest person to crash the art scene of that era\", says Edward Ruscha. He found representation at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles, together with Edward Ruscha, Ed Moses, Billy Al Bengston.\\n\\n\\n== 1960s ==\\n\\nBell\\'s earliest pieces are paintings in the Abstract Expressionist tradition. He began incorporating fragments and shards of clear and mirrored glass into his compositions. At the same time, he began in his painting to produce angular geometric compositions that alluded to or represented three-dimensional forms. These works frequently depicted rectilinear forms with truncated corners. Next there came a series of shadow boxes or “ghost boxes”, three-dimensional cases whose surfaces often featured shapes reminiscent of those in the preceding paintings. Of this transition, critic Peter Frank has observed:\\n\\nThe earliest boxes contained within them, coated onto the glass or even defining their parameters, the angled contours and beveled edges with which the paintings had inferred three-dimensionality; the illusion of volume was thus conflated with actual volume.\\nFrom the shadow box pieces, Bell moved on to begin what is perhaps his most recognizable body of work, namely cube sculptures that rest on transparent pedestals. Bell first started constructing these pieces in the early ‘60s. The earliest examples frequently featured \"the systematic use of modular internal divisions (ellipses, parallelograms, checker and hexagonal arrangements)\", and used a variety of materials including formica, brass, and wood. Three of these works were included in the seminal 1966 exhibit, \"Primary Structures\" at the Jewish Museum in New York.\\n\\n\"Hewn from remaindered bits of glass salvaged at the Burbank frame shop where he worked while studying at Chouinard, Bell\\'s sculptures set the artist apart from his contemporaries. After the Sidney Janis Gallery sold one of his early cubes to Buffalo\\'s Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Pace Gallery in New York offered him a solo show, along with representation, as did Ileana Sonnabend, then based in Paris,\" according to Michael Slenske.\\nBell\\'s surfaces work both as mirrors and windows, sometimes simultaneously. In viewing the cubes, their suspension at torso height on clear pedestals designed by Bell allows the viewer to look up through them from underneath, as well as perceiving them from all four sides and from above. Bell\\'s sculptures have the effect of reading as self-contained objects while simultaneously drawing in their surroundings and proactively changing their environment. For these reasons, the sculptures’ effects depend heavily on their lighting and setting.\\nBell has explored the opportunities afforded by thin film deposition along other avenues. He began creating large, freestanding glass walls that can be arranged in an infinite number of configurations. These larger installations feature panes that extend from the floor or that reach above eye level. In 1968 Bell made the following comments on the perceptual and environmental aspects of this body of work, and on the leap from the cubes to the larger configurations:\\n\\nThe space declared by these new sculptures becomes the work. ...When the pieces get to the kind of scale I am employing then the scale of the material begins to overwhelm the spectator. This creates the sense of a partial environment. So to extend the format may prove to be interesting. Then the observer could walk around and into the unit and at the same time, see through it. Obviously, it will then do totally different things to the observer and the spatial experience will be very dimensional, especially given the ephemeral nature of the material. At the moment my work tends to be frontal and two-sided. This doesn\\'t really worry me, but I would like them to work from all four sides. The beauty of the box format is that it has no dictated top, sides, or bottom—they are interchangeable—and I would like to get some of the same quality into these new works. Obviously, I have to forego a top or bottom.\\nBell appeared on the cover (in a photo cutout by his friend Dennis Hopper) of Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the iconic 1967 Beatles’ album. He appears in the third row. To date, he is one of five surviving persons whose photos are depicted on that cover.\\nIn 1969, Bell received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fine arts.\\n\\n\\n== 1970s and 1980s ==\\n\\nHis inclusion in the Tate Gallery\\'s \"Three Artists from Los Angeles\" exhibition in London in 1970 (alongside Irwin and Doug Wheeler,) further cemented Bell\\'s stature as one of the era\\'s preeminent practitioners—on the West Coast and beyond.\\nTwo large bodies of work on paper, Bell\\'s \"vapor drawings\" and the more recent \"mirage works\", are also the products of Bell\\'s use of thin film deposition technology. The vapor drawings are created by using PET film to mask paper sheets, which are then coated. ELIN 71, from 1982, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of these vapor drawings. \"ELIN\", which stands for \"ellipse insert\", is one of several series of Bell\\'s vapor drawings. Bell describes the advantages of this process and medium:\\n\\nMasking the paper with thin PET film strips to expose areas related to the shape of the page plane enabled me to generate images spontaneously. This work gave me a conscious glimpse of the inherent power of spontaneity and improvisation. The work happened intuitively...In a short amount of time I created a number of interesting pieces. I liked this way of working. It was different from tediously coping with the weight and risk of glass. In my mind, I was investigating improbable visuals using improbable means.\\nThe mirage pieces, on the other hand, are collages constructed out of pieces of coated materials that are then arranged and laminated. As Bell says, \"I colored sheets of various paper materials, strips of PET film, and laminate film. Then I fused them to canvases and stretched them. Tapestries of woven light differentials resulted.\"\\n\\n\\n== 1990s ==\\nBell was the recipient of the 1990 New Mexico Governor\\'s Awards for Excellence in the Arts.\\nIn the early 1990s, Bell was using a computerized sketch program to create images of stick figures. He showed these drawings to architect Frank Gehry while the two were collaborating on proposals for a home commissioned by arts patron and insurance executive Peter B. Lewis. Gehry\\'s enthusiasm for the sketches encouraged Bell to develop the concept further. The project eventually led to Bell\\'s creation of a concept narrative for the figures based on a fictionalized mythology of the early (pre-Babylonian) civilization of Sumer. Bell developed three-dimensional models from a wide variety of materials, and Lewis eventually commissioned two of the figures to be fabricated from bronze, a material developed in Sumer. This body of work was the subject of a 1995 exhibit at the Harwood Museum in Taos, New Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== 2000s ==\\n\\nBell continues his work with the cube to this day; more recent ones are made only of glass and have beveled edges, as opposed to plates that sit within a metal frame. The glass is typically covered with a film that has been treated using a technique called thin film deposition of metallic particles. This process takes place in a vacuum chamber, and involves vaporizing metal alloys that then settle on the glass surface. The concentration of the coating on the glass determines the variation in its reflective properties, and Bell uses this gradation to enhance the transparent and reflective properties of the glass. A modern example of this technique using inconel is \\'Cube #9 (Amber) (2005)\\' in the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\\n\\n\\n== Museum and public collections ==\\n\\nBell\\'s artworks are represented at the following museum and public collections:\\n\\n\\n=== Australia ===\\nArt Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia\\n\\n\\n=== Europe ===\\nCentre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France\\nMusee Saint-Pierre Art Contemporain, Lyon, France\\nMusée d’Art Contemporain, Lyon, France\\nMuseum Abteiberg, Monchengladbach, Germany\\nMuseum Ludwig, Köln, Germany\\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands\\nStedelijk Museum, Rotterdam, Netherlands\\nTate Gallery, London, England\\nVictoria and Albert Museum, London, England\\n\\n\\n=== United States ===\\nAlbright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, United States\\nAnderson Collection at Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States\\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\\nAspen Art Museum, Aspen, Colorado, United States\\nStickman #14 and #23, City of Albuquerque Public Arts, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States\\nHonolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu, Hawaii, United States\\nCorning Museum of Glass, Corning, New York, United States\\nDallas Museum of Art (DMA), Dallas, Texas, United States\\nDes Moines Art Center, Des Moines, Iowa, United States\\nDetroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan, United States\\nFort Worth Art Center, Fort Worth, Texas, United States\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Thomas Hirschhorn (born 16 May 1957) is a Swiss artist who lives and works in Paris.\\nTrained in Zurich and inspired by Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol, he began as a graphic designer and switched to art in the 1990s. He has become known for using everyday materials in the creation of complex sculptures executed often on a large scale. In addition, he has written extensively on his work and the theories that inform it. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums in Europe, in the United States, and in South America.\\n\\n\\n== Biography and work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\nFrom 1978 to 1983, Hirschhorn attended the School of Applied Arts in Zurich, where he was inspired by Beuys and Warhol exhibitions. In 1983, Thomas Hirschhorn came to Paris to take part in the \\'Grapus\\'-collective as a graphic designer.\\n\\n\\n=== Art in public space ===\\nIn 1991, he left graphic design in favor of being an artist. He then started to create works in space that incorporate sculpted forms, words and phrases, free-standing or wall mounted collages, and video sequences. He uses common materials such as cardboard, foil, duct tape, magazines, plywood, and plastic wrap. He describes his choice to use everyday materials in his work as \"political\" and that he only uses materials that are “universal, economic, inclusive, and don\\'t bear any plus-value”. All of his works are accompanied by written statements that include his observations, motivations and intentions. \\nHirschhorn has followed his early commitment to always include the “Other” and address the “non-exclusive audience” in presenting his work in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, but also in “public space”: urban settings, sidewalks, vacant lots, and communal grounds of public housing projects.\\nHe has said that he is interested in the “hard core of reality”, without illusions, and has displayed a strong commitment to his work and role as an artist. He described working and production as “necessary”, discounting anyone who encourages him to not work hard, and says “I want to be overgiving in my work”. Hirschhorn is also very adamant about not being a political artist, but creates “art in a political way.”\\nAiming \"to demonstrate the importance that art can have in transforming life\", he created in 2004 the Musée précaire Albinet in Aubervilliers, France, where he presented for two months original artworks from the Musée national d\\'Art moderne and the Fonds national d\\'art contemporain. The artworks presented included modern art icons such as Bicycle Wheel by Marcel Duchamp, and works by Kazimir Malevich, Piet Mondrian, Salvador Dalí, Josef Beuys, Andy Warhol, Le Corbusier, and Fernand Léger. Located in the public space at the foot of a building bar, in a popular suburb of Paris, the project was an almost unprecedented attempt to bring museum art to underprivileged populations in their own space. The presentation of the works was complemented by numerous workshops, discussions and activities organised with the local population.\\nThrough his experience of working in public space, Hirschhorn has developed his own guidelines of “Presence and Production” in being present and producing on location during the full course of a project in public space. “To be ‘present’ and to ‘produce’ means to make a physical statement, here and now. I believe that only through presence — my presence — and only through production — my production — can my work have an impact in public space or at a public location.” Other ‘Presence and Production’ projects besides the Musée Précaire Albinet include Bataille Monument (Kassel, 2002), The Bijlmer Spinoza Festival (Amsterdam, 2009), Gramsci Monument (New York, 2013), Flamme éternelle (Palais de Tokyo, Paris, 2014), What I can learn from you. What you can learn from me (Critical Workshop) (Remai Modern, Saskatoon 2018), and the Robert Walser-Sculpture (Fondation Exposition Suisse de Sculpture, Biel, 2019).\\nSince early 1990s, Thomas Hirschhorn has created more than seventy works in public space.\\n\\n\\n=== Art and philosophy ===\\nThomas Hirschhorn has dedicated works to writers, philosophers, artists he loves, in the form of altars, kiosks, maps, monuments or sculptures. In 1999 he initiated a series of “monuments” dedicated to major writers and thinkers: the Spinoza Monument (Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 1999), followed by Deleuze Monument (Avignon, France, 2000) and Bataille Monument. From the beginning, the monuments have been planned and constructed in housing projects occupied mostly by the poor and working class, with their agreement and help.\\nIn 2013, Gramsci Monument, tribute to the Italian political theorist and Marxist Antonio Gramsci, was the fourth and last monument, and the first project that Hirschhorn built in the United States. It was a site-specific, participatory sculpture at the Forest Houses complex in the Bronx, New York. This serie of works is based on Hirschhorn\\'s will “to establish a new definition of monument, to provoke encounters, to create an event. [...] My love for Antonio Gramsci is the love of philosophy, the love of the infinitude of thought. It is a question of sharing this, affirming it, defending it, and giving it form.”\\nIn 2000, Hirschhorn exhibited Jumbo Spoons and Big Cake at the Art Institute of Chicago to complement the exhibit at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Flugplatz Welt/World Airport. The 12 Jumbo Spoons are memorials to individuals that he associates with failed utopian ideals. The Big Cake represents excess and violence. World Airport (1999), a clutter of cellophane, tape, partitions, lighting strands, tarmac, televisions, planes, cars, and luggage, represented the artists inability to comprehend the world. \\nFor his piece Cavemanman (2002), he transformed a gallery space into a cave using wood, cardboard, tape, neon tubes, and books, and put various philosophical and pop culture symbols throughout it.\\nHe presented a lecture as part of the \"Image & Text: Writing Off The Page\" lecture series through the Visiting Artists Program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Spring, 2006.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince his first solo show in 1986 (Bar Floréal, Paris), Thomas Hirschhorn has had solo exhibitions at international venues, including the Art Institute of Chicago (1998); Kunsthalle, Bern (1998); and Remai Modern, Saskatoon (2018).\\nIn the summer of 2009, his work Cavemanman was recreated for the exhibition Walking in my Mind at London\\'s Hayward Gallery. Cavemanman was recreated once again in 2022 at the exhibition Dream On by NEON showcasing works from the D.Daskalopoulos Collection Gift at the former Public Tobacco Factory of Athens, Greece.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\n\\nHirschhorn\\'s works are held in collections worldwide, among which the Art Institute of Chicago; Centro de Arte Contemporanea Inhotim,  Brumadinho; Colección Jumex, Mexico; Dia Art Foundation, New York; K21, Düsseldorf; Kunsthalle Mannheim;  Musée national d\\'Art moderne - Centre Pompidou, Paris; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Pinakothek der Moderne, Munchen; Tate Modern, London; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nHirschhorn received the Preis für Junge Schweizer Kunst (1999),  the Marcel Duchamp Prize (2000), the Rolandpreis für Kunst im öffentlichen Raum (2003), the Joseph Beuys Prize (2004), the Kurt Schwitters Prize (2011), and the Meret Oppenheim Prize (2018).

              "  'Cleve Gray (September 22, 1918 – December 8, 2004) was an American Abstract expressionist painter, who was also associated with Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nGray was born Cleve Ginsberg: the family changed their name to Gray in 1936.  Gray attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City (1924–1932). From the age of 11 until the age of 14 he had his first formal art training with Antonia Nell, who had been a student of George Bellows. From 15 to 18 he attended the Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts; where he studied painting with Bartlett Hayes and won the Samuel F. B. Morse Prize for most promising art student. In 1940 he graduated from Princeton University summa cum laude, with a degree in Art and Archeology.  He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  At Princeton he studied painting with James C. Davis and Far Eastern Art with George Rowley, under whose supervision he wrote his thesis on Yuan dynasty landscape painting.\\n\\n\\n== Professional work ==\\nAfter graduation in 1941 Gray moved to Tucson, Arizona. In Arizona he exhibited his landscape paintings and still lifes at the Alfred Messer Studio Gallery in Tucson. In 1942 he returned to New York and joined the United States Army. During World War II, he served in the signal intelligence service in Britain, France and Germany, where he rose to the rank of sergeant. After the liberation of Paris he was the first American GI to greet Pablo Picasso and Gertrude Stein.  He began informal art training with the French artists André Lhote and Jacques Villon, continuing his art studies in Paris after the war.\\nGray returned to the United States in 1946. In 1949 he moved to the house his parents had owned on a 94-acre (380,000 m2) property in Warren, Connecticut, and lived there for the rest of his life. He married the noted author Francine du Plessix on April 23, 1957. They worked in separate studios in two outbuildings with a driveway in between.\\nGray was a veteran of scores of exhibitions throughout his career, as listed below, from the early days Tucson, through to postwar Paris and New York, and most recently in 2002 at the Berry-Hill Gallery in New York City. His paintings are held in the collections of numerous prominent museums and institutions.  In 2009 the art critic Karen Wilkin curated a posthumous retrospective of his work at the Boca Raton Museum of Art, Florida, and other posthumous exhibitions have been held.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nHis wife of 47 years, Francine du Plessix Gray, reported that he died of a \"massive subdural hematoma suffered after he fell on ice and hit his head.\"\\n\\n\\n== Museum collections ==\\n\\nAddison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts\\nAlbright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York\\nBoca Raton Museum of Art, Boca Raton, Florida\\nThe Brooklyn Museum, New York City\\nCathedral of St. John the Divine Art Gallery, New York City\\nColumbia University Art Gallery, New York City\\nColumbus Museum of Art, Ohio\\nThe Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nGrey Art Gallery and Study Center, New York University, New York City\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Jack Whitten (December 5, 1939 – January 20, 2018) was an American painter and sculptor. In 2016, he was awarded a National Medal of Arts.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nWhitten was born in 1939 in Bessemer, Alabama. Planning a career as an army doctor, Whitten entered pre-medical studies at Tuskegee Institute from 1957 to 1959. He also traveled to nearby Montgomery, Alabama to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak during the Montgomery bus boycott and was deeply moved by his vision for a changed America.\\nIn 1960, Whitten went to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to begin studying art and became involved in Civil Rights demonstrations there. Whitten participated in a march from downtown Baton Rouge to the state capitol. Whitten\\'s artist ability led him to be in charge of producing the signs and slogans to be used at that demonstration.\\nWhitten believed strongly about Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s nonviolent approach. However, witnessing the violent reactions from the segregationist made him realize that if he remained in the South he would turn violent himself. Angered by the violent resistance to change he experienced he moved to New York City in 1960. He enrolled immediately at the Cooper Union in the fall of 1960, graduating with a bachelor\\'s degree in fine art in 1964. Afterwards he remained in New York as a working artist, heavily influenced by the abstract expressionists then dominating the art community, especially Willem de Kooning and Romare Bearden.\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\nShortly after graduating from Cooper Union, Whitten had the opportunity to meet other black artists which included, Jacob Lawrence and Norman Lewis, while he remained in New York to start his art career.\\nWhitten\\'s art style was known to be abstract but he liked to refer to his art as art with truth and soul. A large number of Whitten\\'s artwork was inspired by his own experiences during the Civil Rights Movement. Whitten concluded that slavery obstructed the culture of people of color. Therefore, Whitten believed that it was his destiny to restore the culture through his pieces.\\nWhitten\\'s paintings dated back to as early as the 1960s. A large portion of Whitten\\'s artwork had a feathery, soft effect which Whitten discovered was desirable by placing a nylon mesh fabric over his wet acrylic paintings. Whitten also used a T-shaped tool, which he would call the \"developer\". Whitten would move the T-shaped tool across the surface of his art in one single motion. This technique was used to represent one point being related to another.\\n\\nOne of Whitten\\'s most famous pieces of work are his Black Monolith Series. Most of the work in this series was a homage or tribute to black activist, politicians and artists. The two known works from this series includes Whitten\\'s, Black Monolith III for Barbara Jordan, 1998 and the author of Invisible Man, Black Monolith II for Ralph Ellison, 1994.\\nWhitten\\'s work was featured in the Annual Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1972. The Whitney mounted a solo exhibition of his paintings in 1974. He has also had individual shows at numerous private galleries and universities, including a 10-year retrospective in 1983 at the Studio Museum in Harlem and an exhibition of memorial paintings in 2008 at the Atlanta Contemporary Arts Center in Atlanta, Georgia.\\nWhitten spent long portions of the summer in Crete, where he had a studio and made sculptures.\\nThroughout his career, Whitten concerned himself with the techniques and materials of painting and the relationship of artworks to their inspirations. At times he has pursued quickly-applied gestural techniques akin to photography or printmaking. At other times the deliberative and constructive hand is evident. The New York Times labeled him the father of a \"new abstraction.\"\\n\\nWhen the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center occurred, Whitten was at his studio on Lispenard Street in Tribeca. In the following years, he constructed a monumental painting, with ashes embedded into it, as a memorial of the day.\\nPresident Barack Obama awarded Whitten the 2015 National Medal of Arts Award.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 2013, curator Katy Siegel organized the exhibition Light Years: Jack Whitten, 1971-73  at the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. The exhibition featured many works created by Whitten between 1971 and 1973, which had never been exhibited before. In 2014, a retrospective exhibition was organized by The Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego. The exhibition traveled to the Wexner Center for the Arts in 2015 and to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis from September 13, 2015, to January 24, 2016  As part of his Walker engagement, Whitten wrote an Artist Op-Ed on racism and \"the role of art in times of unspeakable violence.\"\\nOn February 3, 2018 Crystal Bridges featured two of Whitten\\'s pieces from the 1970s; one of which was the Homage to Malcolm, 1970.\\nIn 2018, a retrospective \"Odyssey: Jack Whitten Sculpture 1963–2016\" was organized around the time of his passing and opened at the Baltimore Museum of Art from April 22, 2018, to July 29, 2018. The exhibition traveled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from September 6 to December 2, 2018, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from March 3 to May 27, 2019. In 2019, the first solo exhibition in a European institution was shown at Hamburger Bahnhof Museum für Gegenwart Berlin.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nWhitten was represented by Hauser & Wirth (2016–2018), Alexander Gray Associates (2007–2016) and Zeno X Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nAt 78, Whitten died on January 20, 2018.

              "  'Yinka Shonibare  (born 9 August 1962), is a British artist living in the United Kingdom. His work explores cultural identity, colonialism and post-colonialism within the contemporary context of globalisation. A hallmark of his art is the brightly coloured Ankara fabric he uses. As Shonibare is paralysed on one side of his body, he uses assistants to make works under his direction.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nYinka Shonibare was born in London, England, on 9 August 1962, the son of Olatunji Shonibare and Laide Shonibare. When he was three years old, his family moved to Lagos, Nigeria, where his father practised law. When he was 17 years old, Shonibare returned to the UK to take his A-levels at Redrice School. At the age of 18, he contracted transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord, which resulted in a long-term physical disability where one side of his body is paralysed.\\nShonibare studied Fine Art first at Byam Shaw School of Art (now Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) and then at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he received his MFA degree, graduating as part of the Young British Artists generation. Following his studies, Shonibare worked as an arts development officer for Shape Arts, an organisation that makes arts accessible to people with disabilities.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nIn 1999, Shonibare created four alien-like sculptures that he named \"Dysfunctional Family\", the piece consisting of a mother and daughter, both coloured in textures of white and blue, and a father and son textured in the colours of red and yellow.\\nHe has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and at leading museums worldwide. He was notably commissioned by Okwui Enwezor at documenta XI in 2002 to create his most recognised work, Gallantry and Criminal Conversation, which launched him on the international stage.\\nIn 2004, he was shortlisted for the Turner Prize for his Double Dutch exhibition at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam and for his solo show at the Stephen Friedman Gallery, London. Of the four nominees, he seemed to be the most popular with the general public that year, with a BBC website poll resulting in 64 per cent of voters stating that his work was their favourite.\\nShonibare became an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths\\' College in 2003, was awarded an MBE in 2004, received an Honorary Doctorate (Fine Artist) of the Royal College of Art in 2010 and was appointed a CBE in 2019. He was elected Royal Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts in 2013. He joined Iniva\\'s Board of trustees in 2009. He has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and internationally at leading museums worldwide. In September 2008, his major mid-career survey commenced at the MCA Sydney and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in June 2009 and the National Museum of African Art of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, in October 2009. In 2010, Nelson\\'s Ship in a Bottle became his first public art commission on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square.\\nOn 3 December 2016, one of Shonibare\\'s \"Wind Sculpture\" pieces was installed in front of the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of African Art (NMAA) in Washington, DC. The painted fibreglass work, titled \"Wind Sculpture VII\", is the first sculpture to be permanently installed outside the NMAA\\'s entrance.\\nHe runs Guest Projects, a project space for emerging artists based in Broadway Market, east London. He is extending this to spaces in Lagos, Nigeria.\\n\\nIn 2023 his first work of public art was unveiled in Leeds. Entitled Hibiscus Rising, it commemorates the life and death of David Oluwale, a Nigerian homeless man persecuted by Leeds City Police.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nShonibare\\'s work explores issues of colonialism alongside those of race and class, through a range of media which include painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, and, more recently, film and performance. He examines, in particular, the construction of identity and tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories. Mining Western art history and literature, he asks what constitutes our collective contemporary identity today. Having described himself as a \"post-colonial\" hybrid, Shonibare questions the meaning of cultural and national definitions. While he often makes work inspired by his own life and experiences around him, he takes inspiration from around the world; as he has said: \"I\\'m a citizen of the world, I watch television so I make work about these things.\"\\nA key material in Shonibare\\'s work since 1994 is the brightly coloured \"African\" fabric (Dutch wax-printed cotton) that he buys himself from Brixton market in London. \"But actually, the fabrics are not really authentically African the way people think,\" says Shonibare. \"They prove to have a crossbred cultural background quite of their own. And it\\'s the fallacy of that signification that I like. It\\'s the way I view culture – it\\'s an artificial construct.\" Shonibare claims that the fabrics were first manufactured in Europe to sell in Indonesian markets and were then sold in Africa after being rejected in Indonesia. Today the main exporters of \"African\" fabric from Europe are based in Manchester in the UK and Vlisco Véritable Hollandais from Helmond in the Netherlands. Despite being a European invention, the Dutch wax fabric is used by many Africans in England, such as Shonibare. He has these fabrics made up into European 18th-century dresses, covering sculptures of alien figures or stretched onto canvases and thickly painted over.\\nShonibare is well known for creating headless, life-size sculptural figures meticulously positioned and dressed in vibrant wax cloth patterns in order for history and racial identity to be made complex and difficult to read. In his 2003 artwork Scramble for Africa, Shonibare reconstructs the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, when European leaders negotiated and arbitrarily divided the continent in order to claim African territories. By exploring colonialism, particularly in this tableaux piece, the purpose of the headless figurines implies the loss of humanity as Shonibare explains: \"I wanted to represent these European leaders as mindless in their hunger for what the Belgian King Leopold II called \\'a slice of this magnificent African cake.\\'\" Scramble for Africa cannot be read as a \"simple satire\", but rather it reveals \"the relationship between the artist and the work\". It is also an examination of how history tends to repeat itself. Shonibare states: \"When I was making it I was really thinking about American imperialism and the need in the West for resources such as oil and how this pre-empts the annexation of different parts of the world.\"\\nShonibare\\'s Trumpet Boy, a permanent acquisition displayed at The Foundling Museum, demonstrates the colourful fabric used in his works. The sculpture was created to fit the theme of \"found\", reflecting on the museum\\'s heritage, through combining new and existing work with found objects kept for their significance.\\nHe also recreates the paintings of famous artists using headless mannequins with Batik or Ankara textiles instead of European fabrics. He uses these fabrics when depicting European art and fashion to portray a \\'culture clash\\' and a theme of cultural interaction within postcolonialism. An example of some of these recreations would be Gainsborough\\'s Mr and Mrs Andrews Without Their Heads (1998) and Reverend on Ice (2005) (after The Rev Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch by Raeburn).\\nOne artist he recreated multiple works of was Jean Honoré Fragonard. He recreated Fragonard\\'s series The Progress of Love (1771-1773), which included his works The Meeting, The Pursuit, The Love Letter, and The Swing. A unique inclusion within these recreations, was the inclusion of branded fabric. The Swing (After Fragonard) (2001) has the woman on the swing wearing an imitation or \\'knock-off\\' Chanel patterned fabric. The use of this fabric was meant to further explore the themes of post-colonialism, globalism, and cultural interaction that are present throughout much of his work, while also commenting on the consumerism and consumer culture of the modern world and how all of these themes intersect.\\nShonibare also takes carefully posed photographs and videos recreating famous British paintings or stories from literature but with himself taking centre stage as an alternative, black British dandy – for example, A Rake\\'s Progress by Hogarth, which Shonibare translates into Diary of A Victorian Dandy (1998), or his Dorian Gray (2001), named after Oscar Wilde\\'s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\nConsiderably larger than a usual ship in a bottle, yet much smaller than the real HMS Victory, in fact a 1:30-scale model, Shonibare\\'s Nelson\\'s Ship in a Bottle, was \"the first commission on the Fourth Plinth to reflect specifically on the historical symbolism of Trafalgar Square, which commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, and will link directly with Nelson\\'s column.\" The work was placed there on 24 May 2010 and remained until 30 January 2012, being widely admired. In 2011, the Art Fund launched a campaign and successfully raised money for the purchase and relocation of the sculpture to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, where it found its new permanent home.\\nOther works include printed ceramics, and cloth-covered shoes, upholstery, walls and bowls.\\nIn October 2013, Shonibare took part in Art Wars at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund, set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom, who has been missing for more than 10 years. The work was also shown on the Regent\\'s Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.\\nThe Goodman Gallery announced in 2018 that the Norval Foundation, South Africa\\'s newest art museum based in Cape Town, has made a permanent acquisition of Shonibare\\'s Wind Sculpture (SG) III, making it a first for the African continent. The sculpture will be unveiled in February 2019, increasing the British-Nigerian artist\\'s visibility on the continent where he grew up.\\nShonibare has collaborated with Bellerby & Co, Globemakers.\\n\\n\\n== Selected artworks/exhibitions ==\\nShonibare\\'s first solo exhibition was in 1989 at Byam Shaw Gallery, London. During 2008–09, he was the subject of a major mid-career survey in both Australia and the USA; starting in September 2008 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA), Sydney, and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in June 2009 and the Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, in October 2009. For the 2009 Brooklyn Museum exhibition, he created a site-specific installation titled Mother and Father Worked Hard So I Can Play which was on view in several of the museum\\'s period rooms. Another site-specific installation, Party Time—Re-Imagine America: A Centennial Commission was simultaneously on view at the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey, from 1 July 2009, to 3 January 2010, in the dining-room of the museum\\'s 1885 Ballantine House.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nIn 2004, Shonibare was granted the title Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He ironically incorporates the title into his official artistic identity, as he states that it is \"better to make an impact from within rather than from without… it\\'s the notion of the Trojan horse... you go in unnoticed. And then you wreak havoc.\"\\nIn 2019, Yinka Shonibare was awarded and decorated with the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).\\nYinka Shonibare received the Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon Award in March 2021. He is the 8th recipient of this award. The award celebrates artists who have made significant contributions to a particular medium.\\n\\n\\n== Disability ==\\nShonibare is now disabled, physically incapable of making works himself, and relies upon a team of assistants, operating himself as a conceptual artist.\\nShonibare\\'s disability has increased with age, resulting in him using an electric wheelchair. In later life, Shonibare has discussed his disability and its role within his work as a creative artist. In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape Arts \"Open\" exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to an Open theme.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nShonibare, Yinka; Kent, Rachel; Hobbs, Robert C.; Downey, Anthony (2008).

His work was included in the seminal Situation exhibition of 1960 alongside Robyn Denny, William Turnbull and Bernard Cohen among others. This exhibition was a direct reaction by British abstract artists to the recent exhibitions in London of the American Abstract Expressionists in particular the Tate's 1959 exhibition The New American Painting.  Although originally headed for a career in Chemistry, Vaux eventually studied at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1957 to 1960 where he was awarded a Boise traveling scholarship which allowed him to travel in Italy, and later to work at the Jean Ponsa lithographic printing studio in Paris.\\nIn 1986, after a long teaching career he was appointed Head of Painting at the Central/St Martins College of Art and Design in London where he stayed until he retired in 1989 to concentrate full-time on painting.\\nVaux's work has variously been described as minimalist and constructivist although since his primary interest is in colour and light he has more in common with the American west coast artists than the New York minimalists.\\nMarc Vaux said: It [colour] is known to have a direct effect upon the central nervous system/human sensibility, arguably the most effective modifiers of human response, over sound and touch. It is dynamic - dependent on degree of colour, light, surrounding colours. Given the facts it is surprising it has taken so long to come to the position of recognising the effective power of colour alone – the endless potential of colour alone to communicate, affect and modify response.. it can be a pure visual experience equivalent to any other (experience). The nearest equivalent would be the sound of music. I see no reason why colour can't equate with melody and be as memorable. After all Albers wrote poems to equate with his paintings.\\nA monograph Marc Vaux was written by Vaux's long term supporter Norbert Lynton and published by 21 Publishing in 2005 (ISBN 1872784313).\\nThe Tate Gallery holds a good collection of Vaux's work from 1959 to the present day.\\nVaux's first commercial gallery exhibition was at the Grabowski Gallery in London with his then wife Tess Jaray. He was subsequently represented by the Axiom Gallery, Anderson O'Day and then the Redfern Gallery, since 1998 Marc Vaux has been represented by the London art dealer Bernard Jacobson and has had regular exhibitions there.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibition History ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nMarc Vaux at WikiArt.org\\nMarc Vaux at The ArtStack\",\n",
              "  'Tom Holland (born June 15, 1936) is an American visual artist. Holland is known for creating a style of art that may use fiberglass (or fibreglass), aluminum (or aluminium), epoxy paint, plywood, beads, oil paint,  palette knives, marble, copper, paper, and clay. For clay he uses watercolor, acrylic urethane, and ceramic glazes.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nHolland began his formal art education at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was influenced by David Park before traveling to Chile as a Fulbright Grant recipient. Holland\\'s early academic art influence was David Park at Berkeley, but his artistic style continued to develop through his travels and personal experiences.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Contemporary practice ===\\nHis beginning as a painter was labeled \"funky\". It wasn\\'t until Holland began to work with aluminum that he achieved critical acclaim. His work has been described as taking inspiration from Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism, and he has been called one of California\\'s most important contemporary artists and was featured in Art in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1945–1980: An Illustrated History.\\nHolland works primarily with fiberglass and aluminum to create free-standing and wall installations, a style that has been said to encompass Abstract Expressionism (8). He creates his art by riveting metal to the fiberglass or aluminum, then using epoxy paint to add other elements to the piece which add depth, light, and color. His work has been labeled exhilarating and visually challenging, playing games and distorting the three-dimensional space.  Holland is represented by Bivins Gallery in Dallas, Texas.\\n\\n\\n=== Collections ===\\nAnderson Collection\\nBerkeley Art Museum\\nBrooklyn Museum\\nCharles Schwab Company\\nChicago Art Institute\\nCleveland Center for Contemporary Art\\nDenver Art Museum\\nDi Rosa Collections\\nDuker Collection\\nFederal Reserve Bank, San Francisco\\nLos Angeles County Museum*  Mayfield Fund\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nThe National Gallery of Art\\nOakland Museum of California\\nThe Official Residence of the United States Ambassador to Switzerland\\nPalm Springs Desert Museum\\nSan Francisco Art Institute\\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art\\nThe Santa Barbara Museum of Art Collection\\nSeattle Art Museum\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Samuel Lewis Francis (June 25, 1923 – November 4, 1994) was an American painter and printmaker.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nSam Francis was born in San Mateo, California, the son of Katherine Lewis Francis and Samuel Augustus Francis Sr. The 1935 death of his mother affected him deeply; she had encouraged his interest in music. He later developed a strong bond with his stepmother, Virginia Peterson Francis. He attended San Mateo High School in the early 1940s.\\nFrancis served in the United States Air Force during World War II. In 1944, while in the Air Corps he was diagnosed with Spinal Tuberculosis. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while there, after being visited by artist David Park in 1945, that he began to paint. Once out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art. He received both his BA degree (1949) and MA degree (1950) in Art from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied botany, medicine, and psychology.\\n\\n\\n== Career and artistic development ==\\nFrancis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. His loose style was most influenced by the work of Jackson Pollock.  He later became loosely associated with the second generation of abstract expressionists, including Joan Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler, who were increasingly interested in the expressive use of color. But Francis never fit neatly into any school of art. He charted his own trajectory as one of the first global artists working around the world.\\nHe spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there at the Galerie Nina Dausset in 1952. While in Paris he became associated with Tachisme, and had his work championed by art critics Michel Tapié and Claude Duthuit ( the son-in-law of the painter Henri Matisse).\\nBetween 1950 and 1958 Francis spent time and painted in Paris, the south of France, Tokyo, Mexico City, Bern and New York. His artistic development was affected by his exposure to French modern painting, Asian culture and Zen Buddhism in particular. His paintings of the 1950s evolved through a series of stages, beginning with monochromatic abstractions, followed by larger richly colored murals and \"open\" paintings that feature large areas of whiteness. After his 1953 painting \"Big Red\" was included in the 1956 exhibition \"Twelve Artists\" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Francis began a rapid rise to international prominence.\\nFrancis painted large murals for the Kunsthalle, Basel in 1956-8 and for the Chase Manhattan Bank, New York in 1959.\\nBetween 1960 and 1963 he created several series of works, including the \"Blue Balls\" series. Consisting of biomorphic predominantly blue forms and drips, these works referenced the pain that resulted from the renal tuberculosis that he suffered in 1961.\\nIn the early to mid 1960s Francis was represented by the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York City. He returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting, mainly in Los Angeles, but also in Tokyo where he lived primarily in 1973-4. In 1965 Francis started a series of paintings that featured large areas of open canvas, minimal color and strong line.  His work evolved further after he began intensive Jungian analysis with Dr. James Kirsch in 1971 and began paying careful attention to his dreams and the unconscious images they suggested.\\nFrancis\\' works of the early 1970s have been referred to as Fresh Air pictures. Created by adding pools, drips and splatters of color to wet bands of paint applied with a roller, these works re-asserted the artist\\'s interest in color. By 1973–4 many of Francis\\' paintings featured a formal grid or matrix made up of crossing tracks of color. Many of these matrix works were large in scale, measuring up to twenty feet long.\\nAfter 1980 the formal structure of the grid gradually disappeared from Francis\\' work. He was extremely active as a printmaker, creating numerous etchings, lithographs and monotypes, many of which were executed in Santa Monica at the Litho Shop, which Francis owned.\\nIn 1984 Francis founded The Lapis Press with the goal of producing unusual and timely texts in visually compelling formats.\\nDuring the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died.  He died in Santa Monica and was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nSam Francis was married five times, and was the father of four children. He was married from 1947 through 1952 to Vera Miller, a high school girlfriend, then to California painter Muriel Goodwin (1955–58) then to Japanese painter Teruko Yokoi with whom he had a daughter, Kayo. In 1966 he married Mako Idemitsu, with whom he had two sons: Osamu and Shingo.\\nHe married his last wife, painter Margaret Smith, in a Shinto ceremony in Japan in 1985. Their son Augustus, born in 1986, is also an artist.\\n\\n\\n== International reputation ==\\nBecause he worked and exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia, Sam Francis is credited with helping secure international recognition for postwar American painting. His work has been seen most often and best understood in Europe and Japan. In 1991, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\n\\n\\n=== International collections ===\\nPaintings by Sam Francis can be found in international museum collections including those of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, The [Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California], The Kunstmuseum Basel, the Idemitsu Museum of Arts, Tokyo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou-Musee National d\\'Art Moderne, Paris.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Auction records ===\\nOn May 11, 2010, a Francis 1957 painting titled \"Middle Blue\" was sold at auction for $6,354,500, a record for the artist. On May 15, 2013, \"Symphony in Blue,\" a 1958 watercolor and gouache on paper set the record for a Sam Francis work on paper, selling at Sotheby\\'s for $1,145,000.00.

              "  'Liam Gillick (born 1964, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire) is a British artist who lives and works in New York City. Gillick deploys multiple forms to make visible the aesthetics of the constructed world and examine the ideological control systems that have emerged along with globalization and neoliberalism. He utilizes materials that resemble everyday built environments, transforming them into minimalist abstractions that deliver commentaries on social constructs, while also exploring notions of modernism.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nLiam Gillick graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1987 with a degree in fine art. In 1989 he mounted his first solo gallery exhibition, 84 Diagrams, through Karsten Schubert in London. Gillick has exhibited in galleries and institutions in Europe and the United States, many of which have been collaborative projects with other artists, architects, designers and writers.\\nIn 1991, together with art collector, and co-publisher of Art Monthly, Jack Wendler, Gillick founded the limited editions and publishing company G-W Press. The company produced limited editions by artists including Jeremy Deller and Anya Gallaccio.\\nIn the early 1990s Gillick was a member of the band Soho and is credited with providing samples during their live performances.\\nTogether with Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Angela Bulloch and Henry Bond, he was \"the earliest of the YBAs\" — the Young British Artists who dominated British art during the 1990s.\\nGillick was included in the 1996 exhibition Traffic, curated by Nicholas Bourriaud, which first introduced the term Relational Aesthetics.\\nIn 2002, Gillick was selected to produce artworks for the canopy, the glass facade, the kiosks, the entrance ikon, and the vitrines, of the then-recently completed Home Office building, a United Kingdom government department, at Marsham Street, London. \\nIn 2002, Gillick was nominated for the annual British Turner Prize. In the Winter 2006 edition of October (No. 115) Gillick\\'s response to Claire Bishop\\'s October article \"Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics\", was published as \"Contingent Factors: A Response to Claire Bishop\\'s \\'Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics\\'.\" \\nGillick has contributed written articles to fine art journals Frieze and Artforum.\\n\\nIn 2008, Gillick was short-listed for the Vincent Award of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. In 2009, Gillick represented Germany in the Giardini Pavilions of the Venice Biennale.\\nOn 1 October 2010, in an open letter to the British Government\\'s culture secretary Jeremy Hunt — co-signed by a further 27 previous Turner Prize nominees, and 19 winners—Gillick opposed any future cuts in public funding for the arts. In the letter the co-signatories described the arts in Britain as a \"remarkable and fertile landscape of culture and creativity.\"\\nIn October 2010, Gillick contributed a recipe for a vodka and lime juice-based cocktail as his participation in the Ryan Gander art project \"Ryan\\'s Bar\". The beverage titled \"Maybe it would be better if we worked in groups of two and a half,\" was sold for £50 per serving. \\nIn 2010, he composed a score of \"zingy electronica\" for the artists\\' film Beijing, made by his ex-wife, Sarah Morris.\\nIn 2019, Gillick and New Order released a new live album, \"Σ(No,12k,Lg,17Mif)\". The album was recorded live at the 2017 Manchester International Festival. It features new renditions of New Order classics, as well as rarities that the band had not performed in years.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic practice ==\\nGillick\\'s artistic output is characterized by diversity. As Caoimhin Mac Giolla Leith of University College Dublin has said, \"Gillick\\'s practice to date has encompassed a wide range of media and activities (including sculpture, writing, architectural and graphic design, film, and music) as well as various critical and curatorial projects, his work as a whole is also marked by a fondness for diversions and distractions, tangents and evasions.\"\\n\\nThe focus of Gillick\\' practice is evaluations of the aesthetics of social systems with a focus on modes of production rather than consumption. He is interested in forms of social organization. Through his own writings and the use of specific materials in his artworks, Gillick examines how the built world carries traces of social, political and economic systems. As art critic Ina Blom has said,\\n\\n\"Artists such as Liam Gillick ... no longer address abstraction as the principle for the creation of distinct minimalist objects, but rather try to create through design spaces for open social interaction [artworks] whose actual use is to be constantly redefined within the situation of the exhibition - without necessarily producing relational-aesthetic models of community.\"\\n\\nCentral to Gillick\\'s practice are the publications that function in parallel to his artworks. An anthology of these \"Allbooks\" was published by Book Works, in 2009.\\n\\n\\n=== Documents Series with Henry Bond ===\\n\\nBetween 1990 and 1994, Gillick collaborated with artist Henry Bond on their Documents Series, a group of 83 fine art works which appropriated the modus operandi of a news gathering team, in order to produce relational art. In order to make the work, the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association\\'s Gazette — a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous press kit before preparing his audio recording device. \\nThe series was first shown commercially in 1991, at Karsten Schubert Limited and then, in 1992, at Maureen Paley\\'s Interim Art —two of the galleries that were pioneers in the development of the YBA art movement. The series was subsequently exhibited at Tate Modern in the show Century City held in 2001, and at the Hayward Gallery in the exhibition How to Improve the World, in 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Artist books ===\\n\\n\\n=== Exhibitions ===\\nMajor solo exhibitions include Liam Gillick: Annlee You Proposes at Tate Modern, London, 2001-2002; The Wood Way at Whitechapel Gallery in London 2002; Projects 79: Liam Gillick, Literally at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2003; A short text on the possibility of creating an economy of equivalence at Palais de Tokyo, Paris, 2005; and the retrospective project Liam Gillick: Three perspectives and a short scenario 2008-2010, which toured the Kunsthalle Zürich, the Witte de With in Rotterdam, Kunstverein München, and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. The U.S. presentation of the exhibition was the most comprehensive of Gillick\\'s work in an American museum. Accompanying his solo exhibition at the MCA was the show The one hundred and sixty-third floor: Liam Gillick Curates the Collection, curated by Gillick from the MCA collection. In 2016, Gillick presented a solo exhibition, titled Campaign at Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nGillick serves on the board of Artists Space. Alongside Ingrid Schaffner, Tirdad Zolghadr and others, Gillick is a member of the Graduate Committee of the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He has been on the faculty of Columbia University School of the Arts in New York City since 1997. Since 2017, he has been a founding member of The American Friends of the ICA, a support group for the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA).\\nIn 2018, Gillick was a member of the jury that selected Kapwani Kiwanga for the Frieze Artist Award.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nGillick is represented in the UK by Maureen Paley, in the US by Casey Kaplan, and in Ireland by Kerlin Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nGillick is cousin to British artists James and Theodore Gillick. He was married to artist Sarah Morris, in 1998 at a ceremony in Miami. They divorced in 2012. Other relatives include sculptor Ernest Gillick, medallionist Mary Gillick, and anti-abortion activist Victoria Gillick.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nOstrow, Saul (June 2009). \"Liam Gillick: Practical Considerations\".

              "  'Yvonne Rainer (born November 24, 1934) is an American dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker, whose work in these disciplines is regarded as challenging and experimental. Her work is sometimes classified as minimalist art. Rainer currently lives and works in New York.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nYvonne Rainer was born on November 24, 1934, in San Francisco, California. Her parents, Joseph and Jeanette, considered themselves radicals. Her mother, a stenographer, was born in Brooklyn to Jewish immigrants from Warsaw, and her father, a stonemason and house painter, was born in Vallanzengo, northern Italy, and emigrated to the United States at the age of 21. \\nRainer grew up, along with an older brother, in the Sunset District of San Francisco, which she has described as \"a neighborhood of white Protestant working class families\". From the age of twelve, she was \"exposed to the heady commingling of poets, painters, writers, and Italian anarchists.\" \\nThroughout her childhood, her father took her to foreign films at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, while her mother took her to the ballet and opera. She attended Lowell High School, and after graduation she enrolled in San Francisco Junior College and dropped out after a year.\\nIn her late teens, while earning her living as a clerk-typist at an insurance company, Rainer found herself hanging out at the Cellar, a jazz club in North Beach in San Francisco, where she would listen to poets accompanied by live cool jazz musicians. It was here that she met Al Held, a painter. He introduced her to various artists who were natives of New York. In August 1956, aged 21, she followed Held to New York and lived with him for the next three years.\\nDoris Casella, a musician and close friend, introduced Rainer around 1957 to the dance classes of Edith Stephen, a modern dancer. At her first class Stephen told her that she was not very \"turned out.\" Rainer admits, \"What she didn\\'t say was something that I would gradually recognize in the next couple of years, that my lack of turn-out and limberness coupled with a long back and short legs would reduce my chances of performing with any established dance company.\" Beginning in 1959, she studied for a year at the Martha Graham School, where Graham notoriously told her, \"When you accept yourself as a woman, you will have turn-out\"; later she took ballet classes with Mia Slavenska followed by classes with James Waring, in whose company she danced briefly, and for eight years she studied with Merce Cunningham.\\nIn the year in which Rainer studied at the Graham School – 1959-60 – Rainer met Simone Forti and Nancy Meehan, who had worked with Anna Halprin and Welland Lathrop in San Francisco. \\nIn mid-1960, the three rented a New York studio and worked on movement improvisations. In August 1960, she traveled with Forti to Marin County, California to take Halprin\\'s summer workshop, which was very important, in addition to Forti\\'s influence, to Rainer\\'s early solo dance work. In late 1960, both Forti and Rainer attended the choreography workshop that musician-composer Robert Dunn began to conduct in the Cunningham studio based on the theories of John Cage. Here, Rainer created and performed her earliest dances.\\n\\n\\n== Dance and choreographic work ==\\n\\nIn 1962, Rainer, Steve Paxton, and Ruth Emerson approached the Reverend Al Carmines at the Judson Memorial Church to ask if they could begin performing there. The Church was already known for the Judson Poets\\' Theater and Judson Art Gallery, which had been showing the work of Claes Oldenburg, Allan Kaprow, Robert Whitman, Jim Dine, and Tom Wesselmann. It now became a focal point for vanguard dance activity and concerts of dance.\\nRainer is noted for an approach to dance that treats \"the body more as the source of an infinite variety of movements\" than as the purveyor of plot or drama. Many of the elements she employed—such as repetition, tasks, and indeterminacy—later became standard features of contemporary dance. In 1965, when writing about a recent dance — Parts of Some Sextets — for the Tulane Drama Review, she ended the essay with what became her notorious No Manifesto, which she \"reconsidered\" in 2008. In 1969, her work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication which experimented with language and meaning-making.\\n\\nRepetition and sound were employed in her first choreographed piece, Three Satie Spoons (1961), a solo in three parts performed by Rainer to the accompaniment of Eric Satie\\'s Trois Gymnopedies.  The last section contained a repeated \"beep beep beep in a falsetto squeak\" and the spoken line: \"The grass is greener when the sun is yellower.\" Over time her work shifted to include more narrative and cohesive spoken words. Ordinary Dance (1962) was a combination of movement and narrative, and featured the repetition of simple movements while Rainer recited an autobiographical monologue containing the names of the streets on which she had lived while in San Francisco. One characteristic of Rainer\\'s early choreography was her fascination with using untrained performers. We Shall Run (1963) had twelve performers, both dancers and non-dancers who, clad in street clothes, ran around the stage in various floor patterns for twelve minutes to the \"Tuba Mirum\" from Berlioz\\'s Requiem. Her first evening length choreography, for six dancers, called Terrain, was performed at Judson Church in 1963.\\nOne of Rainer\\'s most famous pieces, Trio A (1966), was initially the first section of an evening-long work entitled The Mind Is a Muscle. Her decision in Trio A to execute movements with an even distribution of energy reflected a challenge to traditional attitudes to \"phrasing,\" which can be defined as the way in which energy is distributed in the execution of a movement or series of movements. The innovation of Trio A lies in its attempt to erase the differences of energy investment within both a given phrase and the transition from one to another, resulting in an absence of the classical appearance of \"attack\" at the beginning of a phrase and recovery at the end with energy arrested somewhere in the middle, as in a grand jeté. Another characteristic of this five-minute dance is that the performer never makes eye contact with the spectators, and in the instance in which the movement requires the dancer to face the audience, the eyes are closed or the head is involved in movement. Although Rainer used repetition in earlier works as a device to make movement easier to read, she decided to not repeat any movements in the piece. Trio A is often referred to as a task-oriented performance due to this style of energy distribution, also for its emphasis on a neutral, or characterless, approach to movement execution and a lack of interaction with the audience. The first time the piece was performed it was entitled The Mind is a Muscle, Part 1, and was performed simultaneous, but not in unison, by Rainer, Steve Paxton, and David Gordon. Trio A has been widely taught and performed by other dancers.\\nRainer has choreographed more than 40 concert works.\\n\\n\\n=== Select choreography ===\\nThree Seascapes (1961) a solo in three parts, with each section exploring a different type of relationship between movement and sound. In the first section, wearing a black overcoat, Rainer trots around the perimeter of the stage to the last three minutes of Rachmaninoff\\'s Piano Concerto No. 2,  occasionally lying down in a scrunched up position on her side. In the second segment, she moves slowly across the space, moving her body in undulating spasms. In the first performance in the Judson Church gym, La Monte Young and cohorts performed his \"Poem for Tables, Chairs, and Benches\" by scraping these objects over a concrete floor in the corridor outside the gymnasium. The finale, which was considered to be radical, featured Rainer screaming wildly and thrashing around with a black overcoat and twenty yards of white tulle.\\nTerrain (1962) was Rainer\\'s first evening length work. It had a number of sections, including two \"Talking Solos,\"  with stories by Spencer Holst recited to an unrelated and simultaneous series of movements.\\nContinuous Project-Altered Daily (1970) was performed at the Whitney Museum, eventually morphing into the improvisational Grand Union, of which Rainer was a member for two years.\\nWar (1970), an antiwar dance performed by thirty people at Douglass College protesting the Vietnam War.\\nStreet Action (1970), an action in protest of the invasion of Cambodia by U.S. forces in 1970. It consisted of three columns of people wearing black armbands and swaying from side to side with bowed heads while moving through the streets of Lower Manhattan.\\nThis is the story of a woman who ... (1973), a dance drama using projected narrative texts, a vacuum cleaner, and objects invested with strong meanings such as a mattress, a gun, and a suitcase.\\n\\n\\n== Cinematic work ==\\n\\nRainer sometimes included filmed sequences in her dances, and in 1972 she began to turn her attention to directing feature-length films. The feminist tone of her films, characterized by an interest in how the female body was being viewed or objectified by male directors, resonated with the feminist film theory emerging at the time in seminal texts like Laura Mulvey\\'s Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema. Her early films do not follow narrative conventions; instead, Rainer\\'s films combine autobiography and fiction, sound and intertitles, to address social and political issues. Rainer directed several experimental films about dance and performance, including Lives of Performers (1972), Film About a Woman Who (1974), and Kristina Talking Pictures (1976). Her later films include Journeys from Berlin/1971 (1980), The Man Who Envied Women (1985), Privilege (1990), and MURDER and murder (1996). MURDER and murder, more conventional in its narrative structure, is a lesbian love story dealing with Rainer\\'s own experience of breast cancer. In 2017, Lives of Performers was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and recommended for preservation.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\nHand Movie (1966)\\nVolleyball (1967)\\nTrio Film (1968)\\nRhode Island Red (1968)\\nLine (1969)\\nFive Easy Pieces (1966–69)\\nLives of Performers (1972)\\nFilm About A Woman Who...

In 2006, Rainer choreographed a work entitled AG Indexical, with a Little Help from H.M., which was a reinterpretation George Balanchine\\'s Agon. Rainer continued to choreograph works based on classical pieces, including RoS Indexical (2007), inspired by Vaslav Nijinsky\\'s The Rite of Spring. This work was commissioned for the Performa 07 biennial organized by performance art organization Performa, which has managed Rainer since then.\\nSubsequent works include Spiraling Down (2010), Assisted Living: Good Sports 2 (2010) and Assisted Living: Do You Have Any Money? (2013), two pieces in which Rainer explores the theatrical and historic motif of tableau vivants among political, philosophical and economic readings.\\nAn exhibition at London\\'s Raven Row Gallery was the first to feature live performances of her 1960\\'s dances during an exhibition of photos and scores from her entire career, in addition to film screenings.\\nIn 2015, she choreographed and presented The Concept of Dust, or How do you look when there\\'s nothing left to move? (2015), commissioned by Performa and The Getty Research Institute, a performance containing choreographed work interspersed with a wide range of political, historical, and journalistic texts read intermittently by the dancers and Rainer herself. This work was presented at The Museum of Modern Art, and later toured European venues including La Fondazione Antonio Ratti in Como, Italy, Marseille Objectif Danse in France, and the Louvre. A latter version of this same dance, called The Concept of Dust: Continuous Project-Altered Annually was performed in 2016 at The Kitchen in New York, and in Marseilles, Porto, and Barcelona in 2017.\\n\\n\\n== Feminism ==\\n\\nReading feminist writing and theory allowed Rainer to examine her own experience as a woman, and she was able to think of herself as a participant in culture and society. Little did Rainer realize that her prior choreography was a direct challenge of the \"traditional\" dance and ultimately feminist in nature. Throughout the 1980s, Rainer was celibate, and she was determined \"not to enter into any more ill-fated heterosexual adventures ...\" \\nShe began attending Gay Pride Parades and considered herself a \"political lesbian.\" Rainer participated in a demonstration in New York and Washington D.C. to protest the challenges to Roe v. Wade during this same time period. At the age of 56, she overcame her fears of identifying as a lesbian by becoming intimate with Martha Gever. They are still together today.\\nFeminist Audre Lorde\\'s famous statement posed, \"You can\\'t dismantle the master\\'s house using the master\\'s tools.\" Rainer rebutted her theory by stating: \"You can, if you expose the tools.\"\\nRainer was interviewed for the feminist film !Women Art Revolution.\\nRainer is referenced in several places as example of artist, feminist, and lesbian in the second edition of Feminism Art Theory edited by Hilary Robinson.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nIn 1990, Rainer was awarded with a MacArthur Fellows Program award (or \"Genius Grant\") for her contributions to dance. In 2015 she received the Foundation for Contemporary Arts\\'s Merce Cunningham Award; in 2017 she received a USA Grant. She has also received two Guggenheim Fellowships (1969,1988).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of female film and television directors\\nList of lesbian filmmakers\\nList of LGBT-related films directed by women\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nAnon (2018). \"Artist, Curator & Critic Interviews\". !Women Art Revolution - Spotlight at Stanford.

              "  'Anne-Lise Coste (born 1973) is a French painter living in Orthoux (south of France). Her style can best be described as confrontational and thought-provoking. Her art evokes the contemplative topics that many artist are afraid to engage in like war, friendship, desire, and sexuality.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAnne-Lise Coste was born in 1973 in Marignane, near Marseille. Her passion for nature and animals was deepened, by her inability to be a part of nature and interact with animals, due to her asthma diagnosis in early childhood. She graduated from the École supérieure d\\'art et de design Marseille-Méditerranée and also studied at the Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst in Zurich (Switzerland).\\n\\n\\n== Artistic work ==\\nCoste\\'s paintings and drawings can bring to mind the urgency of graffiti. She says about her work “having faith in the first gesture.” With a language influenced by Dadaism, the artist expresses both subjective emotions and societal criticism. During her time in New York, she included, in her artwork, displays of graffiti, to help visualize, her artwork. A lot of her artwork, was also influenced by her living and working in New York, in a small village. During this time, for seven years, she primarily focussed to express her political views, her opinions of war, her personal relationships, and her sexual desires in her artwork. These views were highlighted, in her work, by using broad strokes in her artwork, to convey a reflection, of her with a rebellious style. Some of her most famous works were influenced, by experiences from her early childhood, such as her work displayed in the exhibition titled, 5 Days and 5 Years. This is a depiction, of her memories, as a child, of the time she spent in a clinical treatment facility. She had several memories of her childhood and the trauma she experienced in the facility; this time is the time, she refers to the memories as, and she describes the memories as an exorcism. This experience, and time in the facility, influenced her to create a series of artworks, 5 Days and 5 Years. Coste has had solo exhibitions in international institutions and galleries, including Kunsthalle St. Gallen (St. Gallen, 2006), Eleven Rivington (New York, 2013), Galería NoguerasBlanchard (Barcelona, 2010, Madrid, 2015), Centre régional d\\'art contemporain Occitanie (fr) (Sète, 2019). Coste\\'s, \"The Blue Nude Women\", of 2017, consists of gestural drawings, constructed with an oil stick, on wood panel. This evokes the viewer, to approach the figure, with the ideology, of the proto abstract-expressionist views of that period. During this time, a group of works was created by Coste, that utilized the influence of looking at, a box of oil pastels. This work, reminded her of a more joyful world, where she was not reminded of the hatefulness of people, with authority, and high positions and how they can abuse that power. She was liberated, from the care of worrying, about the worlds’ opinions and able to focus her true passion instead, of the societal human hierarchy, that we all at times, feel like a hamster on a wheel, trapped and going nowhere.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nMigros Museum of Contemporary Art\\nBarcelona Museum of Contemporary Art\\nFondation pour l\\'art contemporain Salomon (fr)\\nFrac des Pays de la Loire\\nNoguerasBlanchard\\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nNon, Zurich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2003, ISBN 978-3-905509-46-5\\nPoemabout, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2005, ISBN 978-3-905509-59-5\\nRemember, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2008, ISBN 978-3-905509-73-1\\nOù suis-je, Zürich: Edition Patrick Frey, 2014, ISBN 978-3-905929-63-8\\nOil paintings and pastel drawings, Zürich: Nieves, 2017, ISBN 978-3-905999-86-0\\nSors le monde, Lyon: H Editions, 2019, ISBN 979-10-96911-18-9\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nAnne-Lise Coste website',\n",
              "  'Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (born 1977) is a British painter and writer, of Ghanaian heritage. She is best known for her portraits of imaginary subjects, or ones derived from found objects, which are painted in muted colours. Her work has contributed to the renaissance in painting the Black figure. Her paintings often are presented in solo exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nLynette Yiadom-Boakye was born in London, UK where she currently lives and works. Her parents worked as nurses for the National Health Service after emigrating from Ghana in the 1960s. Yiadom-Boakye describes herself as \"a boring child--good grades, no mischief--but also quite good at living in my head, using my imagination as an escape.\" As a senior in high school, she took an art foundations course as an experiment and afterwards gave up her previous intentions to become an optician to become an artist Yiadom-Boakye attended Central St. Martins College of Art and Design (1996-7); however, she did not enjoy her time there, so she transferred to Falmouth College of Art (1997-2000) where she eventually was awarded her undergraduate degree in 2000. She then completed an MA degree at the Royal Academy Schools in 2003. It was there, in her final year of graduate school, that she came to a realization that changed the direction of her work, leading to her fame. In an interview with Dodie Kazanjian of Vogue she stated “Instead of trying to put complicated narratives into my work, I decided to simplify, and focus on just the figure and how it was painted. That in itself would carry the narrative.\" Following college she worked jobs to support herself until 2006 when she received Arts Foundation Fellowship for painting and was able to afford to focus solely on painting.\\nIn 2010 her work was recognized by Okwui Enwezor. With curator Naomi Beckwith, Okwui Enwezor catalogued her exhibition at Studio Museum in Harlem. She was among those nominated for the Turner prize in 2013. In addition to her artwork, Yiadom-Boakye has taught at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford University where she is a visiting tutor for their Master in Fine Arts programme. Her influence as a painter was recognized in the 2019 Powerlist and she was subsequently listed among the \"top 10\" of the most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK in 2020.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Artworks ===\\nYiadom-Boakye\\'s work consists mostly of painted portraits of imaginary Black subjects. Her paintings are predominantly figurative, with raw and muted colors. The characteristic dark palette of her work is known for creating a feeling of stillness that contributes to the timeless nature of her subjects. Her portraits of imaginary individuals feature people reading, lounging, and resting in traditional poses. She brings to the depiction of her subjects contemplative facial expressions and relaxed gestures, making their posture and mood relatable to many viewers. Commentators have attributed some of the acclaim of Yiadom-Boakye\\'s work to this relatability. She strives to keep her subjects from being associated with a particular decade or time; many of her art pieces depict figures/people of African descent. This results in choices such as not painting shoes on her subjects, as footwear often serves as a time stamp. These figures usually rest in front of ambiguous backgrounds, floating inside monochromatic dark hues. These cryptic, but emotional backdrops remind commentators of old masters such as Velasquez and Degas.\\nThe artist\\'s style shifted slightly after the opening of her 2017 show \"In Lieu of a Louder Love\". The show featured a new, warmer colour scheme. Her subjects in this show included more vibrant details such as a checkered linoleum-floor, a bold headwrap and bathing suit, and a yellow, orange, and green background.\\nAlthough each portrait only contains one person, the paintings typically are presented in groups that are arranged as if family portraits. With her expressive representations of the human figure, Yiadom-Boakye examines the formal mechanisms of the medium of painting and reveals political and psychological dimensions in her works, which focus on imaginary characters who exist beyond our world in a different time and in an unknown location. She paints figures who are intentionally removed from time and place, and has stated, \"People ask me, ‘Who are they, where are they?’\\u2009What they should be asking is ‘what\\' are they?\"\\nYiadom-Boakye takes inspiration for her paintings from the found objects she uses as well as personal memories, literature, and art history of painting. She also finds inspiration from music and artists including: Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Nick Drake, Lisa Yuskavage, Chris Offili, and Isaac Julien.\\nThe Tate Museum provides an introduction to her work that is extensive, to accompany a major exhibition of her work held from 2 December 2020 to 9 May 2021.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing ===\\nFor an artist, Yiadom-Boakye is unusual in describing herself as a writer as much as a painter—her short stories and prosy poems frequently appear in her catalogues.\\n\\nExamples of her works shown in catalogues includes five extracts from a detective novel entitled \"an Officer of the Law\" and some intermittent notes on criminality.  Her story \"an Officer of the Law\" is a fictional short story that utilizes animals for the characters. Yiadom-Boakye also creates poetry as shown in her intermittent note \"Something Close to a Confession.\" An example of this:\"Dead but for the life in me,\\nWhere Black rivers run in the Bath,\\nHaving eaten the Activist and her Cause\\nAnd alerted the Ugly to all their Flaws \\nI Bask where God cannot see me.\\nOn Vacant lot, my eyes make water\\n\\nAnd draw the blinds against a Slaughter.\"In talks about her work, the artist notes that her writing is to her as her painting is, and explains that she \"writes the things she doesn\\'t paint and paints all the things she doesn\\'t write\". Her paintings are given poetic titles.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nAt a 2019 auction at Phillips in London, Yiadom-Boakye\\'s Leave A Brick Under The Maple (2015), a life-size portrait of a standing man, sold for about $1 million.\\nAt the 2022 Christie\\'s 20th/21st Century Frieze Week season auction, Yiadom-Boakye\\'s Highpower was estimated at £600,000 and sold for £1,482,000\\n\\n\\n== Subject for work of others ==\\nPainted in 2017, Kehinde Wiley\\'s Portrait of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Jacob Morland of Capplethwaite is displayed in the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, CT.\\nA portrait of Yiadom-Boakye by photographer Sal Idriss is held in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London.\\nPoem After an Iteration of a Painting by Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, Destroyed by the Artist Herself by Ama Codje was published by the Massachusetts\\'s Review on December 26, 2019\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nYiadom-Boakye has staged numerous solo exhibitions at museums and galleries internationally. Her notable solo shows include Any Number of Preoccupations (2010), Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; Verses After Dusk (2015), Serpentine Galleries, London; A Passion To A Principle (2016), Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Under-Song For a Cipher (2017), New Museum, New York; and Fly In League With The Night (2022-2023), Tate Britain, London.\\nShe has also participated in a number of group shows and exhibitions, including the 55th Venice Biennale (2013); the Sharjah Biennial (2015); 58th Venice Biennale (2019), and Afro-Atlantic Histories (2021-2022). Yiadom-Boakye\\'s work is included in several museum collections in the United States including the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the Pérez Art Museum Miami collection, and the picture King for an Hour was on view at the institution\\'s long-term display for 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nYiadom-Boakye has been widely hailed for her work, winning accolades including The Arts Foundation fellowship for painting (2006), the Pinchuk Foundation Future Generation Prize (2012), Next Generation Prize from the New Museum of Contemporary Art (2013), South Bank Sky Arts Award for Visual Art (2016) and the Carnegie Prize at 57th edition of Carnegie International (2018).

              "  'Joel Elias Shapiro (born September 27, 1941 New York City, New York) is an American sculptor renowned for his dynamic work composed of simple rectangular shapes. The artist is classified as a Minimalist as demonstrated in his works, which were mostly defined through the materials used, without allusions to subjects outside of the works. He lives and works in New York City. He is married to the artist Ellen Phelan.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nJoel Shapiro grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, New York. He graduated from Bayside High School (Bayside, NY) in 1959, at which time the school’s yearbook awarded him the title of Man About Town.   When he was twenty two he lived in India for two years while in the Peace Corps. He received a B.A. in 1964 and an M.A. in 1969 from New York University\\n\\n\\n== Work and inspiration ==\\nWhile serving his Peace Corp time in India, Shapiro saw many Indian art works, and has said that \"India gave me the sense of … the possibility of being an artist.\" In India \"Art was pervasive and integral to the society\", and he has said that \"the struggle in my work to find a structure that reflects real psychological states may well use Indian sculpture as a model.\" His early work, which also drew inspiration from Greek art, is characterized by some by its small size, but Shapiro has discounted this perception, describing his early works as, \"all about scale and the small size was an aspect of their scale\". He described scale as \"A very active thing that\\'s changing and altering as time unfolds, consciously or unconsciously,\" and, \"a relationship of size and an experience. You can have something small that has big scale.\" In these works he said that he was trying \"to describe an emotional state, my own longing or desire\". He also said that during this early period in his career he was interested in the strategies of artists Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, and Donald Judd.\\nBy the 1980s, Shapiro began to explore larger and life-size forms in pieces that were still reminiscent of Indian and Greek sculpture but also inspired by the early modernist works by Edgar Degas and Constantin Brâncusi. The bulk of these pieces have been commissioned or acquired by museums and galleries. Later, Shapiro further expanded his repertoire by creating pieces that depicted the dynamism of human form. For instance, his subjects were portrayed in the act of dancing, crouching, and falling, among others that explored the themes of balance, cantilever, projection, and compression. His later works can have the appearance of flying, being impossibly suspended in space, and/or defying gravity. He has said about this shift in his work that he \"wanted to make work that stood on its own, and wasn\\'t limited by architecture and by the ground and the wall and right angles.\" These can be demonstrated in the case of the large-size outdoor art he made for the Hood Museum of Art. The bronze piece was an attenuated form that leans over a walkway and its near-falling form is viewed as an energizing element in the museum\\'s courtyard.

              "  'Michaël Borremans (born 1963) is a Belgian painter and filmmaker who lives and works in Ghent. His painting technique draws on 18th-century art, as well as the works of Édouard Manet and Degas. The artist also cites the Spanish court painter Diego Velázquez as an important influence. In recent years, he has been using photographs he has made himself or made-to-order sculptures as the basis for his paintings. \\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBorremans studied at the Sint-Lucas Hogeschool voor Wetenschap en Kunst (College of Arts and Sciences St. Lucas) in Ghent, receiving his M.F.A. in 1996. Originally trained as a photographer, he turned his attention to drawing and painting in the mid-nineties. He uses old photographs of people and landscapes as inspiration for his work.\\nUntil his break-through, he was a teacher at the Stedelijk Secundair Kunstinstituut Gent (Secondary Municipal Art Institute of Ghent). Another painter Jan Van Imschoot had seen and bought many pieces of his work when it was exhibited in his local pub in Kalken. He put him in touch with Jan Hoet, the founder of the S.M.A.K. (Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst) (City Museum for Contemporary Art) in Ghent, Belgium.  This led to an introduction to Frank Demaegd, owner of Zeno X Gallery in Antwerp, where he had his first major exhibition.\\nIn November 2022, Borremans\\' book As Sweet as It Gets (2014) was featured in the background of an advertising image from the fashion brand Balenciaga. The image was part of a campaign that drew heavy criticism for material in other images alluding to the sexualisation of children. The inclusion of Borremans\\' book led to many people on Twitter creating connections between the campaign and Borremans\\' works, and criticising his paintings, such as the series Fire from the Sun (2018), which show blood-covered toddlers playing in fire and what appear to be human limbs.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and projects ==\\nIn 2011, Borremans\\' work was the subject of a solo exhibition, titled Eating the Beard, which was first on view at Württembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart in Germany and traveled to Műcsarnok Kunsthalle, Budapest, and Kunsthalle Helsinki in Finland. In 2010, he had a solo exhibition at the Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo, and in 2009, he had a solo show at the Kestnergesellschaft in Hanover, Germany\\nIn 2007, he had a solo show at gallery De Appel in Amsterdam, focusing on his cinematic works. In 2005, he had a one-person exhibition of paintings and drawings at the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (S.M.A.K.), Ghent. The paintings then traveled to Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art, London, and The Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin, while the drawings traveled to the Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio. Other solo exhibitions include La maison rouge, Paris (2006); Kunsthalle Bremerhaven, Bremerhaven, Germany; and the Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Basel, Switzerland (both 2004). In 2004, he participated in Manifesta 5, The European Biennial of Contemporary Art.\\nMichaël Borremans: Fixture, was presented at the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de Málaga in 2015–2016. A major museum survey, Michaël Borremans: As sweet as it gets, which included one hundred works from the past two decades, was on view at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in 2014. The exhibition traveled later in the year to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, followed by the Dallas Museum of Art in 2015. Michaël Borremans: The Advantage, the artist\\'s first museum solo show in Japan, was also on view in 2014 at the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo.\\nIn 2018, Borremans had a solo exhibition in Hong Kong titled Fire from the Sun.  The gallery, David Zwirner, described the works as featuring \"toddlers engaged in playful but mysterious acts with sinister overtones and insinuations of violence.\" In her review, Kartya Tylevich said, \"The children are all light-skinned Sistine-style cherubs, sometimes covered in blood. The children do not appear to be distressed or disturbed (though some viewers at the gallery may be).\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nThe Angel (painting)\\nThe Pupils\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\'Michaël Borremans: the secret charms of the enigma essay by Stefan Beyst\\nMichaël Borremans at artnet\\nMichaël Borremans documentary, \\'A Knife in the Eye\\', 2009, directed by Guido De Bruyn.',\n",
              "  'Marc Quinn (born 8 January 1964) is a British contemporary visual artist whose work includes sculpture, installation, and painting. Quinn explores \"what it is to be human in the world today\" through subjects including the body, genetics, identity, environment, and the media. His work has used materials that vary widely, from blood, bread and flowers, to marble and stainless steel. Quinn has been the subject of solo exhibitions at Sir John Soane\\'s Museum, the Tate Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Fondation Beyeler, Fondazione Prada, and South London Gallery. The artist was a notable member of the Young British Artists movement.\\nQuinn is internationally celebrated and was awarded the commission for the first edition of the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2004, for which he exhibited Alison Lapper Pregnant. Quinn\\'s notorious frozen self-portrait series made of his own blood, Self (1991–present) was subject to a retrospective at Fondation Beyeler in 2009.\\nQuinn lives and works in London.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\nQuinn was born in London on 8 January 1964 to a French mother and a British father. He spent his early years in Paris, where his father was a physicist working at the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures). Quinn recalls an early fascination with the scientific instruments in his father\\'s laboratory, in particular atomic clocks. He attended Millfield (a private boarding-school in Somerset), and studied history and history of art at Robinson College, Cambridge.\\nIn the early 1990s, Quinn was the first artist to be represented by gallerist Jay Jopling. The artist had his first exhibition with Jopling in 1991, exhibiting Self (1991), a frozen self-portrait made out of nine pints of the artist\\'s blood.\\nDuring the 1990s, Quinn and several peers were identified for their radical approach to the making and experiencing of art. In 1992, the loosely affiliated group was called the \\'Young British Artists\\' by writer Michael Corris in Artforum, and included Cornelia Parker, Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin.\\nIn 1995, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Tate Britain where new sculptures were shown as part of the Art Now series. In 1997 Quinn\\'s work Self (1991), was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London for the exhibition Sensation. Quinn\\'s Self, along with works by Sarah Lucas and Damien Hirst, were already well known to the British public. The exhibition received widespread media attention and had a record number of visitors for a contemporary art exhibition. The exhibition then travelled to the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin, and to the Brooklyn Museum, New York.\\nIn 1998, he was given a solo exhibition at the South London Gallery, and in 1999, he had a solo exhibition at Kunstverein Hannover. The Groninger Museum presented a solo exhibition of Quinn\\'s work in 2000. The artist was then invited to present a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2000, where he presented an ambitious new work Garden. In 2002, he was given a solo exhibition at Tate Liverpool which included new works and photography, and coincided with the Liverpool Biennial, where Quinn presented 1+1=3. In 2001, the National Portrait Gallery gave Quinn a solo exhibition for his genomic portrait of Sir John Sulston.\\nIn 2004 Quinn was awarded the first ever commission for the Fourth Plinth in London\\'s Trafalgar Square, for which he produced a marble sculpture of pregnant disabled artist, Alison Lapper.\\nIn 2006, Museo d\\'Arte Contemporanea Rome presented Marc Quinn\\'s works in a solo exhibition focused on his recent figurative sculpture, and in 2009, the Fondation Beyeler presented a solo exhibition of Marc Quinn\\'s ongoing series Self, including all sculptures from 1991 to 2006.\\nIn 2012, Quinn was commissioned to produce a monumental work for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games at the London Olympics 2012, for which he produced Breath, a monumental sculpture of Alison Lapper held up by air.\\nIn 2013, Quinn presented a solo exhibition on the occasion of the 55th Venice Biennale for art, at Fondazione Giorgio Cini, Venice, curated by Germano Celant.\\nQuinn\\'s first monograph Memory Box by Germano Celant was published in 2013. A feature-length documentary about Quinn\\'s life and work, Making Waves, was released in 2014, produced and directed by Gerry Fox. London\\'s Somerset House presented a solo exhibition of Quinn in 2015, focusing on recent sculptures.\\nIn 2017, Marc Quinn staged a major exhibition at the Sir John Soane\\'s Museum in London. The exhibition was the first in a new series of collaborations with contemporary artists, designers, and architects, which, inspired by the spirit of Sir John Soane, sought to bring the collection to life in innovative ways.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nQuinn\\'s early work was concerned with issues of corporeality, decay, and preservation. He experimented with organic and degradable materials including bread, blood, lead, flowers and DNA producing sculpture and installation, including Bread Sculptures (1988), Self (1991), Emotional Detox (1995), Garden (2000), and DNA Portrait of John Sulston (2001). In the 2000s, he began to focus on the use of marble, bronze, and concrete. The artist explored the body and its extremes through the lens of classical and urban materials; works included The Complete Marbles (1999–2005), Alison Lapper Pregnant (2004), Evolution (2005–2009) and Planet (2008). Since 2010 he has worked with metals including stainless steel, aluminium, graffiti paints, seaside detritus, tapestry and painting, as seen in The History Paintings (2009–present) and The Toxic Sublime (2014–present).\\n\\n\\n== Early works: 1991–2000 ==\\n\\n\\n=== Self, 1991 – present ===\\nThe first work of Quinn\\'s to gain international fame was Self, which was exhibited in 1991, when he was 27. Self (1991) is a self-portrait formed by a frozen cast of 10 pints of the artist\\'s blood. It is an ongoing work, where the artist portrays himself every five years through a new cast with new blood.\\nThe artworks are placed in transparent plexiglass-glass boxes, on top of freezing cabinets. This highlights a theme of the works, which is dependency.\\nSelf (2006) is owned by the National Portrait Gallery, London.\\n\\n\\n=== Emotional Detox, 1995 ===\\nIn 1995 Quinn produced Emotional Detox, a series of seven sculptures made of lead and cast from the artist\\'s own body, were created at this time. Inspired by traditional iconography of the seven deadly sins, in each sculpture Quinn\\'s body is being torn apart and reconfigured, reflecting detoxification as both a physical and psychological battle.\\nEmotional Detox has been exhibited at Tate Britain, London (1995), Groninger Museum, The Netherlands (2000), and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (2015).\\n\\n\\n=== Garden (2000) ===\\n\\nIn 2000, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at the Fondazione Prada, Milan, which included his most ambitious works, involving organic matter. Garden is a 12-metre-long, 3-metre-high sculpture in which thousands of flowers are frozen in silicone oil. The work now belongs to the Fondazione Prada collection)\\n\\n\\n== Notable works: 2000–2010 ==\\n\\n\\n=== Portrait of John E. Sulston (2001) ===\\nQuinn\\'s portrait of John E. Sulston, who won the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2002 for sequencing the human genome on the Human Genome Project, is in the National Portrait Gallery. It consists of bacteria containing Sulston\\'s DNA in agar jelly. \"The portrait was made by our standard methods for DNA cloning\", writes Sulston. \"My DNA was broken randomly into segments, and treated so that they could be replicated in bacteria. The bacteria containing the DNA segments were spread out on agar jelly in the plate you see in the portrait.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Alison Lapper, The Fourth Plinth (2005–2007) ===\\nQuinn has made a series of marble sculptures of people either born with limbs missing or who have had them amputated. This culminated in his 15-ton marble statue of Alison Lapper, a fellow artist born with no arms and severely shortened legs, which was displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London from September 2005 until October 2007. (The Fourth Plinth is used for rotating displays of sculpture.) In Disability Studies Quarterly, Ann Millett writes, \"The work has been highly criticized for capitalizing on the shock value of disability, as well as lauded for its progressive social values. Alison Lapper Pregnant and the controversy surrounding it showcase disability issues at the forefront of current debates in contemporary art\".\\nA large reproduction of the sculpture was used as a central element of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.\\n\\n\\n=== Sphinx (2006) and Siren (2008) ===\\n\\nSince 2006, Marc Quinn has made numerous studies of the supermodel Kate Moss. In April 2006, Sphinx, a sculpture of Kate Moss by Quinn, was revealed. The sculpture shows Moss in a yoga position with her ankles and arms wrapped behind her ears. This body of work culminated in an exhibition at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in May 2007. The sculpture is on permanent display in Folketeatret in Oslo, Norway.\\nIn August 2008, Quinn unveiled another sculpture of Moss in solid 18-carat gold called Siren, which was exhibited at the British Museum in London. The life-size sculpture was promoted as \"the largest gold statue since ancient Egypt\".\\n\\n\\n=== History Paintings (2009 – present) ===\\nIn 2009 Quinn began his \"History Paintings\" series which has continued to evolve.  The initial group of work in this effort were of enlarged press photos of conflicts around the world rendered into oil on canvas paintings or silk or wool jacquard tapestries.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works: 2010 – present ==\\n\\nIn May 2010, Quinn revealed a series of new sculptures at London\\'s White Cube gallery including The Ecstatic Autogenesis of Pamela based on film actress Pamela Anderson and Chelsea Charms based on pornography model Chelsea Charms.\\nQuinn\\'s models have included \"Catman\" Dennis Avner (who has been tattooed to look like a cat) and transgender people such as Thomas Beatie, Buck Angel, and Allanah Starr. Quinn\\'s portrait sculpture \"Buck & Allanah\" depicts the two nude, standing hand in hand, in a pose reminiscent of Adam and Eve. The sculpture of Thomas Beatie depicts him at full-term pregnancy, bowing his head and cradling his abdomen with two hands.\\nThe exhibition also included a new series of flower paintings executed in reversed colour and two large-scale orchid sculptures in white painted bronze, installed in Hoxton Square, opposite the gallery.\\n\\n\\n=== The Toxic Sublime (2015) ===\\nIn 2015 Marc Quinn opened an exhibition of new work at White Cube Bermondsey, entitled The Toxic Sublime. It featured new bodies of work that explore the ecological impact of man on nature. ‘The Toxic Sublimes’ are distorted, three dimensional seascapes. Alongside these paintings, a new series of sculptures, cast in stainless steel, including one measuring over 7.5 meters long, form part of a body of work titled Frozen Waves. The sculptures originate from the core of shells, eroded by the endless action of waves.\\n\\n\\n=== All About Love (2016–2017) ===\\nIn 2017, Quinn was given a solo exhibition at Sir John Soane\\'s Museum in London. A display of 12 life-cast sculptures, the All About Love series explore the notion of love through the expression of classical fragmented sculpture. Created in collaboration with his partner at the time, the sculptures, which depict the two embracing one another, are works that echo sculptures of many periods from the Renaissance to Auguste Rodin.\\n\\n\\n=== A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 ===\\n\\nThe sculpture A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 was erected secretly in Bristol in the early morning of 15 July 2020; it is Quinn\\'s statue of Black Lives Matter protester, Jen Reid. The statue was mounted on the plinth which formerly held a 19th-century statue of Edward Colston, a Bristol merchant, philanthropist, and Tory Member of Parliament (MP) who had been involved in the Atlantic slave trade. Just over 24 hours after the statue was installed, the Bristol City Council had it taken down as it did not have permission to be installed. The Mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, invited Quinn to make a contribution towards the cost to the council of having his statue removed.\\n\\n\\n=== Viral Paintings (2020) ===\\nThis currently ongoing series of paintings by Quinn are of paint splattered over blown up screen shots of photos and news stories of current events taken on his cell phone and created during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  These new works are considered a continuation of his  History Painting series begun in 2009.\\n\\n\\n== Charity auctions ==\\nQuinn has participated in a number of charity auctions since 2010. His work was auctioned for the UK\\'s homelessness charity, Crisis, in collaboration with Vogue at Christie\\'s in 2010. In 2013, he donated work to the Mimi Foundation charity for cancer auction at Sotheby\\'s. He donated work to the charity auction for Peace One Day at Bonhams, curated by Jake Chapman, in 2014 and 2015.\\nIn 2013 Quinn was commissioned to make a work for RHS Chelsea Flower Show, marking the first time an artist collaborated with the flower show in its 100-year history. The Rush of Nature (2013) was auctioned at Sotheby’s to help raise money for RHS Chelsea Centenary Appeal.\\nWork by Quinn was auctioned at the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation annual St. Tropez Gala in 2016, supporting environmental protection.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\nThe work of the artist is held, among others, in the following public collections:\\n\\nAstrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo\\nBerardo Collection Museum, Lisbon\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\\nMusée d\\'art contemporain de Montréal\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Paris\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nNational Portrait Gallery, London\\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam\\nTate Modern, London\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nOfficial website',\n",
              "  'Wangechi Mutu (born 1972) is a Kenyan American visual artist, known primarily for her painting, sculpture, film, and performance work. Born in Kenya, Mutu now splits her time between her studio there in Nairobi and her studio in Brooklyn, New York, where she  has lived and worked for over 20 years. Mutu\\'s work has directed the female body as subject through collage painting, immersive installation, and live and video performance while exploring questions of self-image, gender constructs, cultural trauma, and environmental destruction and notions of beauty and power.\\n\\n\\n== Background and education ==\\nMutu was born in 1972 in Nairobi, Kenya. She was educated at Loreto Convent Msongari (1978–1989). She left Nairobi at age 16 for high school, studying at the United World College of the Atlantic, in Wales (I.B., 1991). Mutu moved to New York in the late 1990s, focusing on Fine Arts and Anthropology at The New School for Social Research, and Parsons School of Art and Design. She earned a BFA degree from Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Arts and Science in 1996 and a master\\'s degree in sculpture from Yale School of Art in 2000. \\nAs soon as Mutu graduated from Yale, her work began popping up in important shows--many of them international exhibitions and biennials. Importantly, Mutu was not able to see these shows; she had applied for her green card as soon as she had finished her studies, but was unable to leave the country while her application was pending. This was an extra long process for her, in the wake of 9/11--she was effectively stuck in the United States for 12 years. Mutu\\'s experiences of migration and its effects on her diasporic identity infuse her work with an expansive philosophy of belonging. \\nIn an email interview with NPR, Mutu wrote, \"Making art and traveling are my greatest teachers. Everyone should travel, not just to see new things but to see new things in themselves.\" In 2015, the artist made the decision to begin dividing her time between her studios in New York and Nairobi. These travels back and forth, she says, help give her valuable perspective: New York has \"an addictive potency,\" and its density of creative, entrepreneurial people inspires her greatly; Nairobi is \"layered, lush, and encourages a coexistence between humans and the natural world,\" and Mutu describes Kenya as a very attractive country, despite its \"anglophone trauma.\" \\n”It’s the difference between a plant with one root and one with a network of roots. If a plant has just one root, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to stand straight and strong. The idea of having many roots, of having your feet really grounded in different places, is extremely empowering for me.\"\\n\\n\\n== Art ==\\n\\nMutu\\'s work crosses a variety of mediums, including collage, bricolage, video, performance, and sculpture, and investigates themes of gender, race, and colonialism. These mediums, many of which involve the mixing of materials, sources, and imagery, are more than just formal choices--they hint towards foundational themes of resilience and regeneration that appears throughout her oeuvre.\\nMutu\\'s work, in part, centers on the violence and misrepresentation experienced by Black women in contemporary society. A recurring theme of Mutu\\'s work is her various depictions of femininity. Mutu uses the feminine subject in her art, even when the figures are more or less unrecognizable, whether by using the form itself or the texture and patterns the figure is made from. Sometimes she uses cliche images of archetypal women--mothers, virgins, goddesses--as source material, reconfiguring them to create potent, charged images that reflect her own emotional agency, as well as the agency, multitudes, and contradictions of womanhood in general. Her use of otherworldly depictions for women, many times shown in a seemingly sexual or sensual pose, brings about discussion of the objectification of women. Specifically, Mutu addresses the hyper-objectification of black female bodies and has used an otherworldly nature to reiterate the fictitious nature of society\\'s depictions of black women. Mutu uses female subjectivity to examine other social and political issues as well; however, her aim is to always retain focus on female figures, identities, and experiences, in order to bring them to the forefront. \\nWhether through delicate lined patterns or familiar feminine builds, Mutu\\'s various ways of representing feminine qualities is said to enhance the strength of the images or the significance of the issues presented. Many of Mutu\\'s artworks are known to be interpreted in contradictory ways, both seen as complicit to problematic society and as hopeful for future change in society. It\\'s also been said that Mutu\\'s use of such intentionally repulsive or otherworldly imagery may help women to step away from society\\'s ideas of perfection and instead embrace their own imperfections and become more accepting of the flaws of others as well. Although her imagery of female figures has often been described as \"grotesque\", she claims they are instead \"disabled\", displaying a manifestation of historical and societal tensions present in black women\\'s identities. In these mangled forms, the struggle of women forced to comply with social expectations and historical oppressions is given physical form, portraying distinct inner turmoil.\\nMuch of this is accomplished through her use of mixed media, which allows for her to unmake and reimagine bodies through modes of collage. In her Sentinel series which has been active from 2016 until now, she creates regal and fierce abstract female forms made from clay, wood and various found materials.\\nIn an interview with the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia curator, Rachel Kent, she states, \"I try to stretch my own ideas about appropriate ways to depict women. Criticism, curiosity, and voyeurism lead me along, as I look at things I find hard to view – things that are sometimes distasteful or unethical\". Mutu frequently uses \"grotesque\" textures in her artwork and has cited her mother\\'s medical books on tropical diseases as an inspiration, stating that there is \"nothing more insanely visually interesting and repulsive than a body infected with tropical disease; these are diseases that grow and fester and become larger than the being that they have infected, almost.\"\\nMutu is able to enact personal and cultural transfigurations by transitioning from painting to sculpture and back again. Mutu says \" This transition was so powerful because I used my mind as an object maker  – I think I always painted like a sculptor.\" In Mutu\\'s collage work she began to respond to Western advertisement and beauty standards:  \"I began an ongoing critique and an intellectual an actual vandalization of those images, which were violating me by rendering me invisible.\"\\nThe themes and narratives of Mutu\\'s work create a visual representation of certain social, political, and physical realities of the world today. This includes issues of feminism, racism, the environment, and the effects of colonialism and rebuilding post-colonialism. Mutu\\'s visual arts deliberately reject colonial political and social constructs regarding these issues, instead deliberately examining them through the lens of the identities of black women. As a result, she is able to generate unique perspectives by under-represented identities, thus broadening and improving discourse surrounding certain issues, while also recognizing and emphasizing the importance of these women and their experiences.\\nIn her art, Mutu presents complex narratives of mental anguish and, in many ways, crises of identity. Her material transformations of the human body imply a theoretical layer, where psychological aspects of African experience can be represented. Mutu views her own art as a form of self-reflection, and as a way to process her own identity being boiled down to \"black\" as an African woman in America. Furthermore, she uses her art as a way to examine how African identities and experiences on the whole are oversimplified in western discourse, bringing the reality of the intricacies of feminism and colonialism to the forefront through the aesthetics of collage, mixed media art, and Afrofuturism.\\n\\n\\n== Influence of Afrofuturism and Africanfuturism ==\\nMutu\\'s work has been called \"firmly Africanfuturist and Afrofuturist\", as exemplified in her work, including one of her pieces titled The End of Eating Everything (2013). In her 2013–2014 installation at the Brooklyn Museum, the curatorial placard accompanying her work A\\'gave described Afrofuturism as \"an aesthetic that uses the imaginative strategies of science fiction to envision alternate realities for Africa and people of African descent\". For critics, Mutu\\'s imagined alternate realities for Africa through the medium of science fiction definitively situated Mutu in the genre of Afrofuturism.\\nSpecific elements of Mutu\\'s art that situate her within this genre include her amalgamations of humans and machines, or cyborgs, within collages such as Family Tree as well as the film The End of Eating Everything. \\nAdditionally, Mutu\\'s work consistently involves intentional re-imaginations of the African experience. In Misguided Little Unforgivable Hierarchies, she examines social hierarchy and power relationships through the medium of collage, for \"rankings of peoples have historically been constructed around fabricated racial and ethnic categories\".  In Family Tree, as in many of her works, Mutu deliberately constructs both a past and a future within the single figure through displaying diagrams from antique medical journals as well as mechanical images. Mutu uses Afrofuturism to explore themes of alienation, which relates to feminism, colonialism, materiality, and disability. In this way, Afrofuturism acts as a lens for these subjects. The use of Afrofuturistic aesthetics also allows for creative freedom in rendering bodies and representations of identities and experiences, as can be seen with the presence of cyborgs and alien-like figures in her works.\\nThe presence of black women in a futuristic setting also acts as a pushback to ideas of evolutionism and cultural and social hierarchies. By contextualizing these women in such extreme modern spaces, Mutu makes a statement -- that women of color are included in the idea of the idealistic \"evolved\" human. This rejects colonialist ideas about people of color being \"less evolved\", or modernist ideas about people of color being stuck in a less developed state.\\nIn the goal of creating distinct representations of struggles and tensions for female and African identities, the principles and aesthetics of Afrofuturism work well with Mutu\\'s use of collage and mixed media art. These elements form a more holistic approach to examining fractured identities.\\n\\n\\n== Female Representations ==\\nAspects of feminine themes are used across Mutu\\'s body of work. The majority of her artwork, whether in her collages, sculptures, photography, or performances; all of these highlights a female character.\\nA handful of Mutu\\'s works highlight the female figure and feminine features. Using references to a black woman\\'s body, Mutu uses the silhouette or actual photographic imagery of a woman to create the characters in her works. A series of artworks that reflect the use of the female silhouette and elements of photographic images of black females is “The Ark Collection” from 2006. One of the artworks in this collection, titled “Highland Woman, shows a photographic image of a female body meshed with various college elements, helping create a scene as well as create the rest of the silhouette of a female figure, highlighting the photographic elements of a woman\\'s nude breasts. The rest of these works have been discussed as using the female form to create “figurations of black women’s corporeality in visual culture”. She also places a lot of emphasis on body language and the way the woman is situated within the work. \\nAnother feminine aspect that Mutu draws from, is the idea of feminine power. She draws these ideas in her “The Seated series.” In an interview, Mutu claimed this artwork is inspired by “caryatids throughout history,” in which she uses a reference from women of color. Mutu shares that “in Greek architecture, you see these women in their beautiful robes, and then in African sculpture across the continent, you see these women wither kneeling or sitting, sometimes holding a child, as well as holding up the seat of the king.” Most African women in these historical sculptures show women of color in these contexts implemented on the bottom on the pedestal. She wanted to showcase the African American women as being on top of a pedestal to express a reclaim of black female power. She considers the black female experience in her pieces through her inspiration from female forms that showcase power in art history. \\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover\\'s Requiem (2006) ===\\nMutu has exhibited sculptural installations. In 2006, Mutu and British architect David Adjaye collaborated on a project. They transformed the Upper East Side Salon 94 townhouse in New York into a subterranean dinner-party setting entitled Exhuming Gluttony: A Lover\\'s Requiem. Furs and bullet holes adorned the walls while wine bottles dangled in a careless chandelier-like form above the stained table. The table\\'s multiple legs resembled thick femurs with visibly delicate tibias, and the whole space had a pungent aroma. The artists strove to show a moment of gluttony as she stated, \"I wanted to create a feast, a communing of minds and viewers Something has gone wrong, there is a tragedy or unfolding of evil\". This vicious hunger was seen as a connection between images of The Last Supper, the climate of the current art-buying world, and the war in Iraq.\\n\\n\\n=== Cleaning Earth (2006) ===\\nIt is a performance video in which a woman uses a panga [a type of machete] to chop up a log but the wood is impossible to sever. The action serves to emphasize Africa\\'s history of being cut up into portions by colonial forces. The work was shot in a town in Presidio, Texas, a town with racial tension and violence since it sits on the U.S./Mexican border, uprooting energy from the site\\n\\n\\n=== Suspended Playtime (2008) ===\\nAnother installation of Mutu, Suspended Playtime (2008) is a series of bundles of garbage bags, wrapped in gold twine as if suspended in spiders\\' webs, all suspended from the ceiling over the viewer. The installation makes reference to the common use of garbage bags as improvised balls and other playthings by African children.\\n\\n\\n=== Sketchbook Drawing (2011–12) ===\\nAs a visual artist, Mutu takes inspiration from fashion and travel magazines, pornography, ethnography, and mechanics. In 2013, at the Nasher Museum of Art, Mutu showed her sketchbook drawings for the first time ever in her retrospective exhibition, Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey. The books consisted of strangely attractive, yet grotesque human figures fused with animals, plants, or machines.\\n\\n\\n=== The End of Eating Everything (2013) ===\\nIn 2013, Wangechi Mutu\\'s first-ever animated video, The End of Eating Everything, was created in collaboration with recording artist Santigold, commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art. The video was animated by Awesome + Modest.\\n\\n\\n=== Nguva na Nyoka (2014) ===\\nIn 2014, Mutu\\'s art was on display at an exhibition entitled Nguva na Nyoka, at Victoria Miro Gallery in London. At the exhibition\\'s opening night, Mutu displayed a performance piece, wherein guests were encouraged to consume custom-made Wangechi Mutu chocolate mermaids. The guests could obtain a mermaid only by \"snapping a photo of their first bite, lick, taste\", operating as a commentary on \"the public consumption of brown bodies\".\\n\\n\\n=== The Seated series (2019) ===\\nIn 2019, Mutu created bronze statues (titled The Seated I, The Seated II, The Seated IV) for the exterior niches of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The statues seated women were displayed from September 9, 2019 through January 12, 2020.\\n\\n\\n=== MamaRay (2020) ===\\nIn 2020 Mutu completed her large bronze sculpture, MamaRay, commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nMutu\\'s first solo exhibition at a major North American museum opened at the Art Gallery of Ontario in March 2010. On 21 March 2013, she held her first United States solo exhibition, Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey at Nasher Museum of Art. The exhibition Wangechi Mutu: A Fantastic Journey subsequently traveled to the Brooklyn Museum\\'s Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art in October 2013.\\nIn 2014 Mutu founded the charitable organization Africa\\'s Out! located in Brooklyn New York. The organization is devoted to supporting artists whose work subverts traditional narratives around Africa and its diaspora.\\nIn 2016, her film The End of Carrying All was exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas. The film depicts Mutu crossing a landscape with a basket filling up with consumer goods as the landscape changes, ending with a volcanic eruption. In 2016, she also participated in several group exhibits, including \"Blackness in Abstraction,\" at the Pace Gallery in New York, \"Black Pulp!\" at the International Print Center in New York, and \"Africans in America\" at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg.\\nIn 2017, her black bronze sculpture Water Woman, of which depicted a nguva, was placed at the foot of the amphitheater at the Contemporary Austins fourteen-acre sculpture park at Laguna Gloria. Based on the East African folklore of the half woman and half sea creature is a representation of histories narrative of women as cunning temptresses. The exhibition ran from September 23, 2017, to January 14, 2018, when it became a part of the museum\\'s permanent collection.\\nIn September 2019, four female bronze sculptures by Mutu, \"Seated I, II, III, and IV\", were placed to occupy the empty niches always intended to house free-standing sculpture in the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the first instillation and exhibition (\"The New Ones Will Free Us\" September 9 – Fall 2020) of what will be an annual commission meant to feature work by contemporary artists. Mutu has described the bronze statues as having been inspired by caryatids. Initially, the sculptures were planned to be displayed until January 12, 2020, but their exhibition was extended to June 8, 2020, and further extended to Fall 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Seated I\" and \"Seated III\" were subsequently acquired for The Met\\'s permanent collection. A discussion with her about the exhibit and contemporary times was recorded on July 28, 2020 for a series entitled Women and the Critical Eye.\\nIn January 2020, Mutu was part of Artpace\\'s exhibit entitled Visibilities: Intrepid Women of Artpace. Curated by Erin K. Murphy, Visibilities not only kicks off Artpace\\'s 25th anniversary celebration, but also highlights past artists from their International Artist-in-Residency program, such as Mutu who was a resident there in Fall of 2004. Mutu\\'s 12-panel series Histology of the Different Classes of Uterine Tumors, made up of collaged digital prints, was exhibited in the Hudson Showroom.\\nIn 2023 the New Museum featured a retrospective of Mutu\\'s work. The solo exhibition entitled Mutu: Intertwined, features roughly 115 pieces ranging from early in her career to brand new pieces showcasing various mediums and techniques including sculpture, video, collage, and more. Wangechi Mutu\\'s work was included in the Spirit in the Land exhibition and accompanying publication at the Nasher Museum of Art, in 2023, which later traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2024.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\nMutu\\'s artistic oeuvre also embraces film and video installations as media, and the artist has produced a number of films such as Amazing Grace (2005) in the collections of Pérez Art Museum Miami, Eat Cake (2012), The End of eating Everything (2013), and My Cave Call (2021).\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHer work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art; The Studio Museum in Harlem; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Pérez Art Museum Miami, the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University;  the Brooklyn Museum; Tate Modern in London.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nAdrienne Edwards, Courtney J.

              "  'Pat Steir (born 1938) is an American painter and printmaker. Her early work was loosely associated with conceptual art and minimalism, however, she is best known for her abstract dripped, splashed and poured \"Waterfall\" paintings, which she started in the 1980s, and for her later site-specific wall drawings.\\nSteir has had retrospectives and exhibitions all over the world, including the Tate Gallery in London, and shows at the Brooklyn Museum and the New Museum of Contemporary Art that traveled throughout Europe. She has won numerous awards for her work, and is thoroughly represented in major museum collections in the United States and abroad, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Tate Gallery. She is a founding board member of Printed Matter bookshop in New York City, and of the landmark feminist journal, Heresies, first published in 1977.  Steir has also taught art at Parsons School of Design, Princeton University and Hunter College. She has lived and worked primarily in New York City as an adult.  She lives in Greenwich Village.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nSteir was born Iris Patricia Sukoneck in 1940 in Newark, New Jersey. She attended the Pratt Institute in New York (1956–1958), where she was influenced by her teachers Richard Lindner and Phillip Guston, and Boston University College of Fine Arts (1958–1960). Steir returned to Pratt and earned a BFA degree in 1962.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early years ===\\n\\nIn 1962, the year she graduated from art school, Steir was included in a group show at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1964, her work was in a show called “Drawings” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her first one-person exhibition was at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery, New York, in 1964. During that time, she worked in New York as an illustrator and a book designer (1962–1966). Between 1966–1969, Steir was an art director at Harper & Row publishing company, New York. Around 1970 she became friends with Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, and other conceptual artists, and she made the first of many trips to New Mexico to visit Agnes Martin.\\nShe rose to fame in the 1970s with monochromatic canvases of roses and other images that were X-ed out.  The artist explained, “I wanted to destroy images as symbols. To make the image a symbol for a symbol.  I had to act it out―make the image and cross it out. …no imagery, but at the same time endless imagery. Every nuance of paint texture worked as an image.” Nothing from 1974, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of this phase of the artist\\'s work.\\n\\n\\n=== Mature work ===\\n\\nSteir\\'s first museum exhibition, in 1973 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., marks the beginning of a career dense with painting exhibitions. She has also made installation work (shown at Documenta IX, Kassel, Germany, in 1992) and is an important printmaker. Crown Point Press began publishing her prints in 1977 and in 1983 the Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, gave her a print and drawing exhibition. A print retrospective at the Cabinet des Estampes in Geneva traveled to the Tate Gallery in London, England. Steir has had one-person painting exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum in 1984 and the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York in 1987, both of which traveled to other museums, many in Europe.\\nIn the late 1980s, Steir became influenced by the artists John Cage and Agnes Martin and began producing dripped, splashed and poured works, embracing the element of chance. The artist relates this work to the 8th and 9th century Chinese Yipin \"ink-splashing\" painters, having studied ink splash in the harmony of nature and humanity, inspired by Tibetan philosophy. Wind and Water is an example of this phase of her work. In 1989–92 Steir began limiting her colors to monochrome. In 1995, the monograph Pat Steir was published by the American art critic Thomas McEvilley, chronicling the artists\\' life work up to that point. In November 1999, Steir was the subject of an Art in America cover feature, \"Watercourse Way,\" by critic G. Roger Denson, who wrote that Steir\\'s lyrical waterfall paintings attest to her long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, particularly the ancient Chinese philosophy of Daoism, with Steir\\'s literal and figurative motif embodying the flow of water (or in her case, paint) down a surface.\\nDescribing Steir\\'s 2010 installation at Sue Scott Gallery, The Nearly Endless Line, which consisted of a white line snaking around the gallery\\'s blue-black walls, lit with blue light, Sharon Butler writes in The Brooklyn Rail, \"Walking through the darkened space, observers find themselves inside Steir’s painting, where they become part of the illusion she has created with paint and light.\" Pat Steir said \"I wanted to be a great artist, again not in slang in someone who is great. But in the fantastic, reaching the soul of other people.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Awards ===\\nSteir has received many public honors for her work. She was the recipient of Individual Artist (1973) and Art in Public Institutions (1976) grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts in 1982. Both of her alma maters have recognized her: Pratt, with an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Art (1991) and a 2008 Alumni Achievement Award for “outstanding graduates who have distinguished themselves in their fields,\" and Boston University, with a Distinguished Alumni Award (2001). In 2016, Steir was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn a career spanning over fifty years, Steir has exhibited at a large number of galleries and institutions, throughout the U.S. and internationally. Selected galleries where she has had solo exhibitions include: Terry Dintenfass Gallery, Max Protech Gallery, Crown Point Press, M. Knoedler & Co., Victoria Miro Gallery, Robert Miller Gallery, Cheim & Read, Locks Gallery, and Lévy Gorvy.\\nSelected museums and institutions that have held retrospectives and exhibitions of her work include: Ball State University, Corcoran Gallery of Art (1973); Spencer Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston (1983); Brooklyn Museum (1984); Cincinnati Art Museum, Philadelphia College of Art (1985); Museum of Fine Arts Bern, The New Museum of Contemporary Art, The Baltimore Museum of Art (1987); Musée d\\'art contemporain de Lyon (1990); and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum (2010).\\n\\nSilent Secret Waterfalls: The Barnes Series, Barnes Foundation, 2019.\\nPat Steir: Color Wheel, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nSteir’s work is included in major public collections around the world, including:  Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City); Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York City), National Gallery of Art (Washington, D. C.), Tate Gallery (London), Honolulu Museum of Art, Walker Art Center, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Baltimore Museum of Art, Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, Lyon Museum d’Art Moderne, France; MUBA Eugene Leroy, Tourcoing France ;The Long Museum, Shanghai; Kunstmuseum Bern, Switzerland; and Malmo Museum, Sweden.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nSteir, Pat, Pat Steir paintings, New York, Abrams, 1986.\\nSteir, Pat, Arbitrary Order, Paintings by Pat Steir, Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, Texas, 1983.\\nSteir, Pat, Dazzling Water, Dazzling Light, Seattle, University of Washington Press, 2000.\\nMcEvilley, Thomas, \"Pat Steir\", New York, Harry N.

              "  'Milton Ernest \"Robert\" Rauschenberg (October 22, 1925 – May 12, 2008) was an American painter and graphic artist whose early works anticipated the Pop art movement. Rauschenberg is well known for his Combines (1954–1964), a group of artworks which incorporated everyday objects as art materials and which blurred the distinctions between painting and sculpture. Rauschenberg was primarily a painter and a sculptor, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking and performance.\\nRauschenberg received numerous awards during his nearly 60-year artistic career. Among the most prominent were the International Grand Prize in Painting at the 32nd Venice Biennale in 1964 and the National Medal of Arts in 1993.\\nRauschenberg lived and worked in New York City and on Captiva Island, Florida, until his death on May 12, 2008.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nRauschenberg was born Milton Ernest Rauschenberg in Port Arthur, Texas, the son of Dora Carolina (née Matson) and Ernest R. Rauschenberg. His father was of German and his mother of Dutch descent. Rauschenberg incorrectly claimed that his paternal grandmother Tina “Tiny” Jane Howard was Cherokee. His father worked for Gulf States Utilities, a light and power company. His parents were Fundamentalist Christians. He had a younger sister named Janet Begneaud.\\nAt 18, Rauschenberg was admitted to the University of Texas at Austin where he began studying pharmacology, but he dropped out shortly after due to the difficulty of the coursework—not realizing at this point that he was dyslexic—and because of his unwillingness to dissect a frog in biology class. He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1944. Based in California, he served as a neuropsychiatric technician in a Navy hospital until his discharge in 1945 or 1946.\\nRauschenberg subsequently studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and the Académie Julian in Paris, France, where he met fellow art student Susan Weil. At that time he also changed his name from Milton to Robert. In 1948 Rauschenberg joined Weil in enrolling at Black Mountain College in North Carolina.\\nAt Black Mountain, Rauschenberg sought out Josef Albers, a founder of the Bauhaus in Germany, whom he had read about in an August 1948 issue of Time magazine. He hoped that Albers\\' rigorous teaching methods might curb his habitual sloppiness. Albers\\' preliminary design courses relied on strict discipline that did not allow for any \"uninfluenced experimentation.\"\\nRauschenberg became, in his own words, \"Albers\\' dunce, the outstanding example of what he was not talking about\". Although Rauschenberg considered Albers his most important teacher, he found a more compatible sensibility in John Cage, an established composer of avant-garde music. Like Rauschenberg, Cage had moved away from the disciplinarian teachings of his instructor, Arnold Schönberg, in favor of a more experimentalist approach to music. Cage provided Rauschenberg with much-needed support and encouragement during the early years of his career, and the two remained friends and artistic collaborators for decades to follow.\\nFrom 1949 to 1952 Rauschenberg studied with Vaclav Vytlacil and Morris Kantor at the Art Students League of New York, where he met fellow artists Knox Martin and Cy Twombly.\\nRauschenberg married Susan Weil in the summer of 1950 at the Weil family home in Outer Island, Connecticut. Their only child, Christopher, was born July 16, 1951. The two separated in June 1952 and divorced in 1953. Thereafter, Rauschenberg had romantic relationships with fellow artists Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns, among others. His partner for the last 25 years of his life was artist Darryl Pottorf, his former assistant.\\nIn the 1970s he moved into NoHo in Manhattan in New York City.\\nRauschenberg purchased the Beach House, his first property on Captiva Island, on July 26, 1968. However, the property did not become his permanent residence until the fall of 1970.\\nRauschenberg died of heart failure on May 12, 2008, on Captiva Island, Florida.\\n\\n\\n== Artistic contribution ==\\nRauschenberg\\'s approach was sometimes called \"Neo-Dadaist,\" a label he shared with the painter Jasper Johns. Rauschenberg famously stated that \"painting relates to both art and life,\" and he wanted to work \"in the gap between the two.\" Like many of his Dadaist predecessors, Rauschenberg questioned the distinction between art objects and everyday objects, and his use of readymade materials reprised the intellectual issues raised by Marcel Duchamp\\'s Fountain (1917). Duchamp\\'s Dadaist influence can also be observed in Jasper Johns\\' paintings of targets, numerals, and flags, which were familiar cultural symbols: \"things the mind already knows.\"\\n\\nAt Black Mountain College, Rauschenberg experimented with a variety of artistic mediums including printmaking, drawing, photography, painting, sculpture, and theatre; his works often featured some combination of these. He created his Night Blooming paintings (1951) at Black Mountain by pressing pebbles and gravel into black pigment on canvas. In the very same year he made full body blueprints in collaboration with Susan Weil in his New York apartment, which \"they hope to turn [...] into screen and wallpaper designs\".\\nFrom the fall of 1952 to the spring of 1953, Rauschenberg traveled in Italy and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly. There, he created collages and small sculptures, including the Scatole Personali and Feticci Personali, out of found materials. He exhibited them at galleries in Rome and Florence. To Rauschenberg\\'s surprise, a number of the works sold; many that did not he threw into the river Arno, following the suggestion of an art critic who reviewed his show.\\nUpon his return to New York City in 1953, Rauschenberg began creating sculpture with found materials from his Lower Manhattan neighborhood, such as scrap metal, wood, and twine. Throughout the 1950s, Rauschenberg supported himself by designing storefront window displays for Tiffany & Co. and Bonwit Teller, first with Susan Weil and later in partnership with Jasper Johns under the pseudonym Matson Jones.\\n\\nIn a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg requested a drawing from the Abstract Expressionist painter Willem de Kooning for the express purpose of erasing it as an artistic statement. This conceptual work, titled Erased de Kooning Drawing, was executed with the elder artist\\'s consent.\\nIn 1961, Rauschenberg explored a similar conceptual approach by presenting an idea as the artwork itself. He was invited to participate in an exhibition at the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris, where artists were to present portraits of Clert, the gallery owner. Rauschenberg\\'s submission consisted of a telegram declaring \"This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so.\"\\nBy 1962, Rauschenberg\\'s paintings were beginning to incorporate not only found objects but found images as well. After a visit to Andy Warhol\\'s studio that year, Rauschenberg began using a silkscreen process, usually reserved for commercial means of reproduction, to transfer photographs to canvas. The silkscreen paintings made between 1962 and 1964 led critics to identify Rauschenberg\\'s work with Pop art.\\nRauschenberg had experimented with technology in his artworks since the making of his early Combines in the mid-1950s, where he sometimes used working radios, clocks, and electric fans as sculptural materials. He later explored his interest in technology while working with Bell Laboratories research scientist Billy Klüver. Together they realized some of Rauschenberg\\'s most ambitious technology-based experiments, such as Soundings (1968), a light installation which responded to ambient sound. In 1966, Klüver and Rauschenberg officially launched Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a non-profit organization established to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.\\nIn 1969, NASA invited Rauschenberg to witness the launch of Apollo 11. In response to this landmark event, Rauschenberg created his Stoned Moon Series of lithographs. This involved combining diagrams and other images from NASA\\'s archives with his own drawings and handwritten text.\\n\\nFrom 1970, Rauschenberg worked from his home and studio in Captiva, Florida. The first works he created in his new studio were Cardboards (1971–72) and Early Egyptians (1973–74), for which he relied on locally sourced materials such as cardboard and sand. Where his previous works had often highlighted urban imagery and materials, Rauschenberg now favored the effect of natural fibers found in fabric and paper. He printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrost (1974–76) and Spread (1975–82) series; the latter featured large stretches of collaged fabric on wood panels. Rauschenberg created his Jammer (1975–76) series using colorful fabrics inspired by his trip to Ahmedabad, India, a city famous for its textiles. The imageless simplicity of the Jammer series is a striking contrast with the image-filled Hoarfrosts and the grittiness of his earliest works made in New York City.\\nInternational travel became a central part of Rauschenberg\\'s artistic process after 1975. In 1984, Rauschenberg announced the start of his Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) at the United Nations. Almost entirely funded by the artist, the ROCI project consisted of a seven-year tour to ten countries around the world. Rauschenberg took photographs in each location and made artworks inspired by the cultures he visited. The resulting works were displayed in a local exhibition in each country. Rauschenberg often donated an artwork to a local cultural institution.\\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, Rauschenberg focused on silkscreening imagery onto a variety of differently treated metals, such as steel and mirrored aluminum. He created many series of so-called \"metal paintings,\" including: Borealis (1988–92), Urban Bourbons (1988–1996), Phantoms (1991), and Night Shades (1991). In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques. As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, in his late painting series he transferred digital inkjet photographic images to a variety of painting supports. For his Arcadian Retreats (1996) he transferred imagery to wet fresco. His Love Hotel [Anagram (A Pun)] from 1998, and made out of vegetable dye transfer on polylaminate, is included in the permanent collection of the Pérez Art Museum Miami, in Florida, the artist\\'s home state for nearly forty years. In keeping with his commitment to the environment, Rauschenberg used biodegradable dyes and pigments, and water rather than chemicals in the transfer process.\\n\\n\\n=== The White Paintings, black paintings, and Red Paintings ===\\nIn 1951 Rauschenberg created his White Painting series in the tradition of monochromatic painting established by Kazimir Malevich, who reduced painting to its most essential qualities for an experience of aesthetic purity and infinity. The White Paintings were shown at Eleanor Ward\\'s Stable Gallery in New York in fall 1953. Rauschenberg used everyday white house paint and paint rollers to create smooth, unembellished surfaces which at first appear as blank canvas. Instead of perceiving them to be without content, however, John Cage described the White Paintings as \"airports for the lights, shadows and particles\"; surfaces which reflected delicate atmospheric changes in the room.\\nRauschenberg himself said that they were affected by ambient conditions, \"so you could almost tell how many people are in the room.\"\\nLike the White Paintings, the black paintings of 1951–1953 were executed on multiple panels and were predominantly single color works. Rauschenberg applied matte and glossy black paint to textured grounds of newspaper on canvas, occasionally allowing the newspaper to remain visible.\\nBy 1953 Rauschenberg had moved from the White Painting and black painting series to the heightened expressionism of his Red Painting series. He regarded red as \"the most difficult color\" with which to paint, and accepted the challenge by dripping, pasting, and squeezing layers of red pigment directly onto canvas grounds that included patterned fabric, newspaper, wood, and nails. The complex material surfaces of the Red Paintings were forerunners of Rauschenberg\\'s well-known Combine series (1954-1964).\\n\\n\\n=== Combines ===\\n\\nRauschenberg collected discarded objects on the streets of New York City and brought them back to his studio where he integrated them into his work. He claimed he \"wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing.\"\\nRauschenberg\\'s comment concerning the gap between art and life provides the departure point for an understanding of his contributions as an artist. He saw the potential beauty in almost anything; he once said, \"I really feel sorry for people who think things like soap dishes or mirrors or Coke bottles are ugly, because they\\'re surrounded by things like that all day long, and it must make them miserable.\" His Combine series endowed everyday objects with a new significance by bringing them into the context of fine art alongside traditional painting materials. The Combines eliminated the boundaries between art and sculpture so that both were present in a single work of art. While \"Combines\" technically refers to Rauschenberg\\'s work from 1954 to 1964, Rauschenberg continued to utilize everyday objects such as clothing, newspaper, urban debris, and cardboard throughout his artistic career.\\n\\nHis transitional pieces that led to the creation of Combines were Charlene (1954) and Collection (1954/1955), where he collaged objects such as scarves, electric light bulbs, mirrors, and comic strips. Although Rauschenberg had implemented newspapers and patterned textiles in his black paintings and Red Paintings, in the Combines he gave everyday objects a prominence equal to that of traditional painting materials. Considered one of the first of the Combines, Bed (1955) was created by smearing red paint across a well-worn quilt, sheet, and pillow. The work was hung vertically on the wall like a traditional painting. Because of the intimate connections of the materials to the artist\\'s own life, Bed is often considered to be a self-portrait and a direct imprint of Rauschenberg\\'s interior consciousness. Some critics suggested the work could be read as a symbol for violence and rape, but Rauschenberg described Bed as \"one of the friendliest pictures I\\'ve ever painted.\" Among his most famous Combines are those that incorporate taxidermied animals, such as Monogram (1955–1959) which includes a stuffed angora goat, and Canyon (1959), which features a stuffed golden eagle. Although the eagle was salvaged from the trash, Canyon drew government ire due to the 1940 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.\\nCritics originally viewed the Combines in terms of their formal qualities: color, texture, and composition. The formalist view of the 1960s was later refuted by critic Leo Steinberg, who said that each Combine was \"a receptor surface on which objects are scattered, on which data is entered.\" According to Steinberg, the horizontality of what he called Rauschenberg\\'s \"flatbed picture plane\" had replaced the traditional verticality of painting, and subsequently allowed for the uniquely material-bound surfaces of Rauschenberg\\'s work.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance and dance ===\\nRauschenberg began exploring his interest in dance after moving to New York in the early 1950s. He was first exposed to avant-garde dance and performance art at Black Mountain College, where he participated in John Cage\\'s Theatre Piece No. 1 (1952), often considered the first Happening. He began designing sets, lighting, and costumes for Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor. In the early 1960s he was involved in the radical dance-theater experiments at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and he choreographed his first performance, Pelican (1963), for the Judson Dance Theater in May 1963. Rauschenberg was close friends with Cunningham-affiliated dancers including Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, and Steve Paxton, all of whom featured in his choreographed works. Rauschenberg\\'s full-time connection to the Merce Cunningham Dance Company ended following its 1964 world tour. In 1966, Rauschenberg created the Open Score performance for part of 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering at the 69th Regiment Armory, New York. The series was instrumental in the formation of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.).\\nIn 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in thirteen years to create Travelogue (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs. Rauschenberg did not choreograph his own works after 1967, but he continued to collaborate with other choreographers, including Trisha Brown, for the remainder of his artistic career.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nThroughout his career, Rauschenberg designed numerous posters in support of causes that were important to him. In 1965, when Life magazine commissioned him to visualize a modern Inferno, he did not hesitate to vent his rage at the Vietnam War and other contemporary sociopolitical issues, including racial violence, neo-Nazism, political assassinations, and ecological disaster.\\nIn 1969 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City commissioned Rauschenberg to create a piece in honor of its centennial. He learned that the museum\\'s original goals were detailed in a certificate from 1870 and created his \\'Centennial Certificate\\' based on that object, with images of some of the best-known pieces in the museum and the signatures of the board at that time. Copies of the Centennial Certificate exist in numerous museums and private collections.\\nOn December 30, 1979, the Miami Herald printed 650,000 copies of Tropic, its Sunday magazine, with a cover designed by Rauschenberg. In 1983, he won a Grammy Award for his album design of Talking Heads\\' album Speaking in Tongues. In 1986 Rauschenberg was commissioned by BMW to paint a full size BMW 635 CSi for the sixth installment of the famed BMW Art Car Project. Rauschenberg\\'s car was the first in the project to feature reproductions of works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as well as his own photographs.\\nIn 1998, the Vatican commissioned a work by Rauschenberg in honor of the Jubilee year 2000 to be displayed in the Padre Pio Liturgical Hall, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. Working around the theme of the Last Judgement, Rauschenberg created The Happy Apocalypse (1999), a twenty-foot-long maquette. It was ultimately rejected by the Vatican on the grounds that Rauschenberg\\'s depiction of God as a satellite dish was an inappropriate theological reference.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nRauschenberg had his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery in spring 1951. In 1953, while in Italy, he was noted by Irene Brin and Gaspero del Corso and they organized his first European exhibition in their famous gallery in Rome. In 1953, Eleanor Ward invited Rauschenberg to participate in a joint exhibition with Cy Twombly at the Stable Gallery. In his second solo exhibition in New York at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1954, Rauschenberg presented his Red Paintings (1953–1953) and Combines (1954–1964). Leo Castelli mounted a solo exhibition of Rauschenberg\\'s Combines in 1958. The only sale was an acquisition by Castelli himself of Bed (1955), now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\\nRauschenberg\\'s first career retrospective was organized by the Jewish Museum, New York, in 1963. In 1964 he became one of the first American artists to win the International Grand Prize in Painting at the Venice Biennale (James Whistler and Mark Tobey had previously won painting prizes in 1895 and 1958 respectively). A mid-career retrospective was organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, D.C., and traveled throughout the United States between 1976 and 1978.\\nIn the 1990s a retrospective was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1997), which traveled to museums in Houston, Cologne, and Bilbao through 1999. An exhibition of Combines was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2005; traveled to Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and Moderna Museet, Stockholm, through 2007). Rauschenberg\\'s first posthumous retrospective was mounted at Tate Modern (2016; traveled to Museum of Modern Art, New York, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art through 2017).\\nFurther exhibitions include: Robert Rauschenberg: Jammers, Gagosian Gallery, London (2013); Robert Rauschenberg: The Fulton Street Studio, 1953–54, Craig F. Starr Associates (2014);  A Visual Lexicon, Leo Castelli Gallery (2014); Robert Rauschenberg: Works on Metal, Gagosian Gallery, Beverly Hills (2014); Rauschenberg in China, Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing (2016); and Rauschenberg: The 1/4 Mile at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2018–2019).\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nRauschenberg believed strongly in the power of art as a catalyst for social change. The Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) began in 1984 as an effort to spark international dialogue and enhance cultural understanding through artistic expression. A ROCI exhibition went on view at the National Gallery of Art, D.C., in 1991, concluding a ten-country tour: Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, U.S.S.R., Germany, and Malaysia.\\nIn 1970, Rauschenberg created a program called Change, Inc., to award one-time emergency grants of up to $1,000 to visual artists based on financial need. In 1990, Rauschenberg created the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RRF) to promote awareness of the causes he cared about, such as world peace, the environment and humanitarian issues. In 1986, Rauschenberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1993. In 2000, Rauschenberg was honored with amfAR\\'s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS.\\nRRF today owns many works by Rauschenberg from every period of his career. In 2011, the foundation presented The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg in collaboration with Gagosian Gallery, featuring selections from Rauschenberg\\'s personal art collection. Proceeds from the exhibition helped fund the foundation\\'s philanthropic activities. Also in 2011, the foundation launched its \"Artist as Activist\" project and invited artist Shepard Fairey to focus on an issue of his choice. The editioned work he made was sold to raise funds for the Coalition for the Homeless. RRF continues to support emerging artists and arts organizations with grants and philanthropic collaborations each year. The RRF has several residency programs that take place at the foundation\\'s headquarters in New York and at the late artist\\'s property in Captiva Island, Florida.\\nIn 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Open Score (1966) seventh in his list of the all-time greatest performance art works.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nIn 2010 Studio Painting (1960‑61), one of Rauschenberg\\'s Combines originally estimated at $6 million to $9 million, was bought from the collection of Michael Crichton for $11 million at Christie\\'s, New York. In 2019, Christie\\'s sold the silkscreen painting Buffalo II (1964) for $88.8 million, shattering the artist\\'s previous record.\\n\\n\\n=== Lobbying for artists\\' resale royalties ===\\nIn the early 1970s, Rauschenberg lobbied U.S. Congress to pass a bill that would compensate artists when their work is resold on the secondary market. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties (droit de suite) after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his collection of Abstract Expressionist and Pop art works for $2.2 million. Scull had originally purchased Rauschenberg\\'s paintings Thaw (1958) and Double Feature (1959) for $900 and $2,500 respectively; roughly a decade later Scull sold the pieces for $85,000 and $90,000 in a 1973 auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.\\nRauschenberg\\'s lobbying efforts were rewarded in 1976 when California governor Jerry Brown signed into law the California Resale Royalty Act of 1976. The artist continued to pursue nationwide resale royalties legislation following the California victory.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCombine painting\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBusch, Julia M., A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s Archived September 29, 2007, at the Wayback Machine (The Art Alliance Press: Philadelphia; Associated University Presses: London, 1974) ISBN 0-87982-007-1, ISBN 978-0-87982-007-7.\\nMarika Herskovic, New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.)

              "  'Helen Frankenthaler (December 12, 1928 – December 27, 2011) was an American abstract expressionist painter. She was a major contributor to the history of postwar American painting. Having exhibited her work for over six decades (early 1950s until 2011), she spanned several generations of abstract painters while continuing to produce vital and ever-changing new work. Frankenthaler began exhibiting her large-scale abstract expressionist paintings in contemporary museums and galleries in the early 1950s. She was included in the 1964 Post-Painterly Abstraction exhibition curated by Clement Greenberg that introduced a newer generation of abstract painting that came to be known as color field. Born in Manhattan, she was influenced by Greenberg, Hans Hofmann, and Jackson Pollock\\'s paintings. Her work has been the subject of several retrospective exhibitions, including a 1989 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and been exhibited worldwide since the 1950s. In 2001, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.\\nFrankenthaler had a home and studio in Darien, Connecticut.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nHelen Frankenthaler was born on December 12, 1928, in New York City. Her father was Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court judge. Her mother, Martha (Lowenstein), had emigrated with her family from Germany to the United States as an infant. Helen\\'s two sisters, Marjorie and Gloria, were six and five years older, respectively. Growing up on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side, Frankenthaler absorbed the privileged background of a cultured and progressive Jewish intellectual family that encouraged all three daughters to prepare themselves for professional careers. Her nephew is the artist/photographer Clifford Ross.\\nFrankenthaler studied at the Dalton School under muralist Rufino Tamayo and also at Bennington College in Vermont. While at Bennington, Frankenthaler studied under the direction of Paul Feeley, who is credited with helping her understand pictorial composition, as well as influencing her early cubist-derived style. Upon her graduation in 1949, she studied privately with Australian-born painter Wallace Harrison, and with Hans Hofmann in 1950. She met Clement Greenberg in 1950 and had a five-year relationship with him. She married the painter Robert Motherwell in 1958; the couple divorced in 1971. Both born of wealthy parents, they were known as \"the golden couple\" and for their lavish entertaining. She gained two stepdaughters from him, Jeannie Motherwell and Lise Motherwell. Jeannie Motherwell studied painting at Bard College and the Art Students League in New York and had several exhibits.\\nIn 1994, Frankenthaler married Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., an investment banker who served the Gerald Ford administration.\\n\\n\\n== Style and technique ==\\n\\nActive as a painter for nearly six decades, Frankenthaler passed through many phases and stylistic shifts. Initially associated with abstract expressionism because of her focus on forms latent in nature, Frankenthaler is identified with the use of fluid shapes, abstract masses, and lyrical gestures. She made use of large formats on which she painted, generally, simplified abstract compositions. Her style is notable in its emphasis on spontaneity, as Frankenthaler herself stated, \"A really good picture looks as if it\\'s happened at once.\"\\nFrankenthaler\\'s official artistic career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of Mountains and Sea. Throughout the 1950s, her works tended to be centered compositions. In 1957, Frankenthaler began to experiment with linear shapes and more organic, sun-like, rounded forms. In the 1960s, her style shifted towards the exploration of symmetrical paintings, as she began to place strips of colors near the edges of her paintings. Her style grew to be more simplified. She began to make use of single stains and blots of solid color against white backgrounds, often in the form of geometric shapes. Beginning in 1963, Frankenthaler began to use acrylic paints rather than oil paints because they allowed for both opacity and sharpness when put on the canvas. By the 1970s, she had done away with the soak stain technique entirely, preferring thicker paint that allowed her to employ bright colors almost reminiscent of Fauvism. Throughout the 1970s, Frankenthaler explored the joining of areas of the canvas through the use of modulated hues, and experimented with large, abstract forms. Her work in the 1980s was characterized as much calmer, with its use of muted colors and relaxed brushwork. \"Once one\\'s true talent begins to emerge, one is freer in a way but less free in another way, since one is a captive of this necessity and deep urge\".\\n\\n\\n=== Color field painting ===\\n\\nIn 1960, the term color field painting was used to describe the work of Frankenthaler. In general, this term refers to the application of large areas, or fields, of color to the canvas. This style was characterized by the use of hues that were similar in tone or intensity, as well as large formats and simplified compositions, all of which are qualities descriptive of Frankenthaler\\'s work from the 1960s onward. The color field artists differed from abstract expressionists in their attempted erasure of emotional, mythic, and religious content.\\n\\n\\n=== Technique ===\\nFrankenthaler often painted onto unprimed canvas with oil paints that she heavily diluted with turpentine, a technique that she named \"soak stain.\" This allowed for the colors to soak directly into the canvas, creating a liquefied, translucent effect that strongly resembled watercolor. Soak stain was also said to be the ultimate fusing of image and canvas, drawing attention to the flatness of the painting itself. The major disadvantage of this method, however, is that the oil in the paints will eventually cause the canvas to discolor and rot away. The technique was adopted by other artists, notably Morris Louis (1912–1962) and Kenneth Noland (1924–2010), and launched the second generation of the color field school of painting.  Frankenthaler often worked by laying her canvas out on the floor, a technique inspired by Jackson Pollock.\\nFrankenthaler preferred to paint in privacy. If assistants were present, she preferred them to be inconspicuous when not needed.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nOne of her most important influences was Clement Greenberg (1909–1994), an art and literary critic with whom she had a personal friendship and who included her in the Post-Painterly Abstraction exhibition that he curated in 1964. Through Greenberg she was introduced to the New York art scene. Under his guidance she spent the summer of 1950 studying with Hans Hofmann (1880–1966), catalyst of the Abstract Expressionist movement.\\nThe first Jackson Pollock show Frankenthaler saw was at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1950. She had this to say about seeing Pollock\\'s paintings Autumn Rhythm, Number 30, 1950 (1950), Number One,1950 (Lavender Mist) (1950):\\n\\nIt was all there. I wanted to live in this land.  I had to live there, and master the language. \\nSome of her thoughts on painting:\\n\\nA really good picture looks as if it\\'s happened at once.  It\\'s an immediate image. For my own work, when a picture looks labored and overworked, and you can read in it—well, she did this and then she did that, and then she did that—there is something in it that has not got to do with beautiful art to me. And I usually throw these out, though I think very often it takes ten of those over-labored efforts to produce one really beautiful wrist motion that is synchronized with your head and heart, and you have it, and therefore it looks as if it were born in a minute.\\nJohn Elderfield wrote that the watercolors of Paul Cézanne and John Marin were important early influences:Watercolor... expands the brightness and flatness of plein-air painting because it visibly reveals these qualities in the whiteness of its support, which always makes its presence felt due to the insubstantiality of its covering. Marin and Cézanne were important to Frankenthaler not only for their watercolors or for the lightness of their work, but, more importantly, because both of them had liberated their oil paintings by treating them like watercolors, which was what Frankenthaler began to do... In Cézanne’s case this transposition of techniques also encouraged him to leave uncovered areas of white canvas between patches of thinned-down oil. This was especially interesting to Frankenthaler too.\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Paintings ===\\nIn Mountains and Sea, her first professionally exhibited work, Frankenthaler made use of the soak stain technique. The work itself was painted after a trip to Nova Scotia, which partly questions the extent of its non-representational status. Although Mountains and Sea is not a direct depiction of the Nova Scotia coastline, elements of the work suggest a kind of seascape or landscape, like the strokes of blue that join with areas of green. Much like Mountains and Sea, Frankenthaler\\'s Basque Landscape (1958) seems to refer to a very specific, external environment, but it is also abstract. The same can be said for Lorelei (1956), a work based on a boat ride Frankenthaler took down the Rhine.\\nSwan Lake #2 (1961) depicts a large area of blue paint on the canvas, with breaks in the color that are left white. A rectilinear brown square encompasses the blue, balancing both the cool tones of the blue with the warmth of the brown, and the gestural handling of the paint with the strong linearity of the square.\\nEden, from 1956, is an interior landscape, meaning it depicts the images of the artist\\'s imagination. Eden tells the story of an abstract, interior world, idealized in ways that a landscape never could be. The work is almost entirely gestural, save for the incorporation of the number \"100\" two times in the center of the image. When asked about the process of creating this work, Frankenthaler stated that she began by painting the numbers, and that a sort of symbolic, idealized garden grew out of that.\\n\\n\\n=== Prints and woodcuts ===\\nFrankenthaler recognized a need to continually challenge herself to develop as an artist. For this reason, in 1961, she began to experiment with printmaking at the Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE), a lithographic workshop in West Islip, Long Island. Frankenthaler collaborated with Tatyana Grosman in 1961 to create her first prints.\\nIn 1976, Frankenthaler began to work within the medium of woodcuts. She collaborated with Kenneth E. Tyler. The first piece they created together was Essence of Mulberry (1977), a woodcut that used eight different colors. Essence of Mulberry was inspired by two sources: the first was an exhibition of fifteenth century woodcuts that Frankenthaler saw on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the second being a mulberry tree that grew outside of Tyler\\'s studio. In 1995, the pair collaborated again, creating The Tales of Genji, a series of six woodcut prints. To create woodcuts with a resonance similar to Frankenthaler\\'s painterly style, she painted her plans onto the wood itself, making maquettes. The Tales of Genji took nearly three years to complete. Frankenthaler then went on to create Madame Butterfly, a print that employed one hundred and two different colors and forty-six woodblocks.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and legacy ==\\nFrankenthaler received the National Medal of Arts in 2001. She served on the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1985 to 1992. Her other awards include First Prize for Painting at the first Paris Biennial (1959); Temple Gold Medal, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia (1968); New York City Mayor\\'s Award of Honor for Arts and Culture (1986); and Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement, College Art Association (1994). In 1990, she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\nFrankenthaler did not consider herself a feminist: \"For me, being a \\'lady painter\\' was never an issue. I don\\'t resent being a female painter. I don\\'t exploit it. I paint.\" Mary Beth Edelson\\'s feminist piece Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper, with the heads of notable women artists including Frankenthaler collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\"\\nIn 1953, Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis saw her Mountains and Sea which, Louis said later, was a \"bridge between Pollock and what was possible.\" On the other hand, some critics called her work \"merely beautiful.\" Grace Glueck\\'s obituary in The New York Times summed up Frankenthaler\\'s career:\\n\\nCritics have not unanimously praised Ms. Frankenthaler\\'s art. Some have seen it as thin in substance, uncontrolled in method, too sweet in color and too \"poetic.\" But it has been far more apt to garner admirers like the critic Barbara Rose, who wrote in 1972 of Ms. Frankenthaler\\'s gift for \"the freedom, spontaneity, openness and complexity of an image, not exclusively of the studio or the mind, but explicitly and intimately tied to nature and human emotions.\\n\\n\\n=== Helen Frankenthaler Foundation ===\\nThe New York-based Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, established and endowed by the artist during her lifetime, is dedicated to promoting greater public interest in and understanding of the visual arts. In 2021 the foundation created Frankenthaler Climate Initiative. In July 2021, the foundation award the first round of grants totaling $5.1 million. The recipients included the Museo de Arte de Ponce, the Santa Rosa Indian Museum and Cultural Center, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the Yale University Arts Center.\\nIn a 2023 lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, Frankenthaler’s nephew Frederick Iseman claimed that Clifford Ross and other family members on the board exploited the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation “to advance their own personal interests and careers” and were committed to completely shutting down the foundation in the near future.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nFrankenthaler\\'s first solo exhibition took place at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, New York, in the fall of 1951. Her first major museum show, a retrospective of her 1950s work with a catalog by the critic and poet Frank O\\'Hara, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, was at the Jewish Museum in 1960. Subsequent solo exhibitions include \"Helen Frankenthaler,\" Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1969; traveled to Whitechapel Gallery, London; Orangerie Herrenhausen, Hanover; and Kongresshalle, Berlin), and \"Helen Frankenthaler: a Painting Retrospective,\" The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (1989–90; traveled to the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and Detroit Institute of Arts).

In The New York Times in 1989, she argued government funding for the arts was \"not part of the democratic process\" and was \"beginning to spawn an art monster\". According to the Los Angeles Times, \"Frankenthaler did take a highly public stance during the late 1980s \\'culture wars\\' that eventually led to deep budget cuts for the National Endowment for the Arts and a ban on grants to individual artists that still persists. In a 1989 commentary for The New York Times, she wrote that, while \"censorship and government interference in the directions and standards of art are dangerous and not part of the democratic process,\" controversial grants to Andres Serrano, Robert Mapplethorpe, and others reflected a trend in which the NEA was supporting work \"of increasingly dubious quality.

              "  'Janet Cardiff (born March 15, 1957) is a Canadian artist who works chiefly with sound and sound installations, often in collaboration with her husband and partner George Bures Miller. Cardiff first gained international recognition in the art world for her audio walks in 1995. She lives and works in British Columbia, Canada.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nJanet Cardiff was born in 1957 in Brussels, Ontario, Canada, and grew up on a farm outside of a small village. In 1980, she earned her BFA from Queens University, Kingston, Ontario. In 1983 she earned an MVA from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. While studying in Edmonton, she met George Bures Miller who would become her husband and collaborator. Cardiff\\'s training is in photography and printmaking and her early works were large-scale silkscreens. Her first artistic collaboration with Bures Miller, in 1983, was a Super-8 film called The Guardian Angel.  After this filmmaking experience, Cardiff\\'s work began to include elements of narrative sequencing, experiments with sound, and movement.\\n\\n\\n== Solo works ==\\nHer first major work based on recorded sound was called The Whispering Room, a minimal work consisting of a dark space with 16 small round speakers mounted on stands that play the voice of individual characters. As visitors move through the space and the voices, a film projector is triggered playing a slightly slow-motion film.\\nSome of Cardiff\\'s most well-known solo works are her audio walks. Her first was created somewhat serendipitously during a residency at the Banff Centre in 1991. In 1996, she was asked to create a site-specific piece for the museum grounds at Louisiana Museum in Denmark. Since then, she has created notable walks such as Her Long Black Hair (2004), in and around Central Park, and Words Drawn in Water (2005) for the Hirshhorn Museum.\\nCardiff has been included in exhibitions such as Present Tense, Nine Artists in the Nineties, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, NowHere, Louisiana Museum, Denmark, The Museum as Muse, Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie International \\'99/00, the Tate Modern Opening Exhibition as well as a project commissioned by Artangel in London. This project (\"The Missing Voice (Case Study B)\") was commissioned in 1999 and continues to run. It is an audio tour that leaves from the Whitechapel Library, next to the Whitechapel tube stop and snakes its way through London\\'s East End, weaving fictional narrative with descriptions about the actual landscape. Cardiff represented Canada at the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1998, and at the 6th Istanbul Biennial in 1999 with her partner George Bures Miller.\\n\\nIn her Forty Part Motet (2001) she placed 40 speakers in 8 groups, each speaker playing a recording of one voice singing Thomas Tallis\\' Spem in alium, enabling the audience to walk through the space and \"sample\" individual voices of the polyphonic vocal music. This work is now part of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada., the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and of Inhotim in Brumadinho, Brazil. This work was presented at The Cloisters, September to December 2013, that museum\\'s first presentation of contemporary art. The work was installed in the Fuentidueña Chapel, which features the late twelfth-century apse from the church of San Martín at Fuentidueña, near Segovia, Spain, providing a transformed acoustic experience.\\nA mid-career retrospective, Janet Cardiff: A Survey of Works, Including Collaborations with George Bures Miller, opened at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, Queens, in 2001 and has travelled to Montréal, Oslo, and Turin. Exhibitions in 2006 include Good Vibrations–Le arti visive e il Rock, Palazzo delle Papesse, Centro Arte Contemporanea, Siena; Anticipation, The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; and Sonic Presence, Bergen Kunsthall, Bergen, Norway.\\nIn Real Time (1999) was the very first video walk that Cardiff created.  It took place in the library of the Carnegie Museum of Art and begins with the participant donning a pair of headphones attached to a small video camera.  Upon playback Cardiff says to watch the screen and follow along with what we see and hear for approximately 18 minutes.  This piece relies on the discrepancies between what is seen on the video monitor and what is occurring in the library.\\n\\n\\n== Work with George Bures Miller ==\\n\"The Dark Pool\" was the first multimedia installation collaboration Cardiff and Miller created and showed in 1995 in Vancouver. The work consists of a dimly lit room, furnished with cardboard, carpets, and collected ephemera and artifacts, through which visitors move, triggering sounds such as musical segments, portions of conversations, and bits of stories. Cardiff and Miller consider the work very personal and, despite offers, have not sold it. \\nCardiff and Bures Miller represented Canada at the 49th Venice Biennale with Paradise Institute (2001), a 16-seat movie theatre where viewers watched a film, becoming entangled as witnesses to a possible crime played out in the real world audience and on the screen. Cardiff and Bures Miller have recently had exhibitions at Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco (2018), the Art Gallery of Alberta (2010), Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland (2008) the Miami Art Museum (2007) Vancouver Art Gallery (2005), Luhring Augustine, New York (2004), Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2003), Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) (2002), National Gallery of Canada (2002) and Oakville Galleries, Oakville, Ontario (2000). In 2012, she took part along with her husband in the Kassel’s Documenta. They proposed two installations:  the first one is an audio installation in the forest called Forest (for a thousand years…) of a 28 minute audio loop. The second one is a 26-minute video walk specially produced for Documenta and called Alter Bahnhof video walk. In 2013, the Art Gallery of Ontario and Vancouver Art Gallery organized Lost in the Memory Palace: Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller, a selected survey, which took as its focus Cardiff and Miller\\'s work from the mid-1990s to 2013. Recent projects include Thought Experiments in F♯ Minor (2019), a site-specific, immersive, video installation at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; and Cardiff & Miller (2019), a solo exhibition at Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Monterrey in Mexico.\\n\\n\\n== Awards given jointly to Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller ==\\nNational Gallery of Canada Millennium Prize (2001);\\nLa Biennale di Venezia Special Award at Venice, presented to Canadian artists for the first time (2001);\\nthe Benesse Prize, recognizing artists who break new artistic ground with an experimental and pioneering spirit (2001);\\nthe Käthe Kollwitz Prize, Germany (2011);\\nthe Wilhelm Lehmbruck Prize in honor of their life’s work, which has \"opened up new perspectives for sculpture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries\" (2020)\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nRideau Street Chapel\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJanet Cardiff and George Miller\\nWords Drawn in Water\\nTate Liverpool\\n\"Creating Worlds\" Excerpt of profile from ascent magazine\\nKultureFlash Interview (01/2003)\\nGregory Mario Whitfield\\'s Whitechapel Review',\n",
              "  'Christo Vladimirov Javacheff (1935–2020) and Jeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon (1935–2009), known as Christo and Jeanne-Claude, were artists noted for their large-scale, site-specific environmental installations, often large landmarks and landscape elements wrapped in fabric, including the Wrapped Reichstag, The Pont Neuf Wrapped, Running Fence in California, and The Gates in New York City\\'s Central Park.\\nBorn in Bulgaria and Morocco, respectively, the pair met and married in Paris in the late 1950s. Originally working under Christo\\'s name, they later credited their installations to both \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude\". Until his own death in 2020, Christo continued to plan and execute projects after Jeanne-Claude\\'s death in 2009.\\nTheir work was typically large, visually impressive, and controversial, often taking years and sometimes decades of careful preparation – including technical solutions, political negotiation, permitting and environmental approval, hearings and public persuasion. The pair refused grants, scholarships, donations or public money, instead financing the work via the sale of their own artwork.\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude described the myriad elements that brought the projects to fruition as integral to the artwork itself, and said their projects contained no deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact; their purpose being simply for joy, beauty, and new ways of seeing the familiar.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude met in October 1958 when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother, Précilda de Guillebon. Their first show, in Cologne, 1961, showcased the three types of artworks for which they would be known: wrapped items, oil barrels, and ephemeral, large-scale works. Near Christo\\'s first solo show in Paris, in 1962, the pair blocked an alley with 240 barrels for several hours in a piece called Iron Curtain, a poetic reply to the Berlin Wall.\\nThey developed consistent, longtime terms of their collaboration. They together imagined projects, for which Christo would create sketches and preparatory works that were later sold to fund the resulting installation. Christo and Jeanne-Claude hired assistants to do the work of wrapping the object at hand. They originally worked under the name \"Christo\" to simplify dealings and their brand, given the difficulties of establishing an artist\\'s reputation and the prejudices against female artists, but they would later retroactively credit their large-scale outdoor works to both \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude\". They eventually flew in separate planes such that, in case one crashed, the other could continue their work.\\nThe couple relocated to New York City, the new art world capital, in 1964. Christo began to make Store Fronts, wooden facades made to resemble shop windows, which he continued for four years. His largest piece was shown in the 1968 Documenta 4. In the mid-1960s, they also created Air Packages, inflated and wrapped research balloons. In 1969, at the invitation of the museum director Jan van der Marck they wrapped the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art while it remained open. It was panned by the public and ordered to be undone by the fire department, which went unenforced. With the help of Australian collector John Kaldor, Christo and Jeanne-Claude and 100 volunteers wrapped the coast of Sydney\\'s Little Bay as Wrapped Coast, the first piece for Kaldor Public Art Projects.\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\n\\nWithin a year of Wrapped Coast, Christo began work on Valley Curtain: an orange curtain of fabric to be hung across the mountainous Colorado State Highway 325. They simultaneously worked on Wrapped Walk Ways (Tokyo and Holland) and Wrapped Island (South Pacific), neither of which came to fruition. The artists formed a corporation to benefit from tax and other liabilities, a form they used for later projects. Following a failed attempt to mount the curtain in late 1971, a new engineer and builder-contractor raised the fabric in August 1972. The work only stood for 28 hours before the wind again destroyed the fabric. This work, their most expensive to date and first to involve construction workers, was captured in a documentary by David and Albert Maysles. Christo\\'s Valley Curtain was nominated for Best Documentary Short in the 1974 Academy Awards. The Maysles would film many of the artists\\' later projects.\\nInspired by a snow fence, in 1972, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began preparations for Running Fence: a 24.5-mile fence of white nylon, supported by steel posts and steel cables, running through the California landscape and into the ocean. In exchange for temporary use of ranch land, the artists agreed to offer payment and use of the deconstructed building materials. Others challenged its construction in 18 public hearings and three state court sessions. The fence began construction in April 1976 and the project culminated in a two-week display in September, after which it was deconstructed.\\nTheir 1978 Wrapped Walk Ways covered paths within Kansas City, Missouri\\'s Loose Park in 12,540 square meters (135,000 square feet) of saffron-colored nylon fabric covering 4.4 kilometers (2.7 miles) of the park\\'s formal garden walkways and jogging paths.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude planned a project based on Jeanne-Claude\\'s idea to surround eleven islands in Miami\\'s Biscayne Bay with 603,850 m2 (6,499,800 sq ft) of pink polypropylene floating fabric. Surrounded Islands was completed on May 7, 1983, with the aid of 430 workers and could be admired for two weeks. The workers were outfitted with pink long sleeve shirts with pale blue text written on the back reading “Christo Surrounded Islands”, and then in acknowledging the garment\\'s designer, \"designed and produced by Willi Smith\".\\nJeanne-Claude became an American citizen in March 1984. The couple received permission to wrap the Pont Neuf, a bridge in Paris, in August 1985. The bridge stayed wrapped for two weeks (22 Sep - 5 Oct 1985). The Pont Neuf Wrapped attracted three million visitors. Wrapping the Pont Neuf continued the tradition of transforming a sculptural dimension into a work of art. The fabric maintained the principal shapes of the Pont Neuf but it emphasized the details and the proportions. As with Surrounded Islands, workers who assisted with the installation and deinstallation of Pont Neuf Wrapped wore uniforms designed by Willi Smith.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\n\\nTheir 1991 The Umbrellas involved the simultaneous setup of blue and gold umbrellas in Japan and California, respectively. The 3,100-umbrella project cost US$26 million and attracted three million visitors. Christo closed the exhibition early after a woman was killed by a windblown umbrella in California. Separately, a worker was killed during the deconstruction of the Japanese exhibit.\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped the Berlin Reichstag building in 1995 following 24 years of governmental lobbying across six Bundestag presidents. Wrapped Reichstag\\'s 100,000 square meters of silver fabric draped the building, fastened with blue rope. Christo described the Reichstag wrapping as autobiographical based on his Bulgarian upbringing. The wrapping became symbolic of unified Germany and marked Berlin\\'s return as a world city. The Guardian posthumously described the work as their \"most spectacular achievement\".\\nIn 1998, the artists wrapped trees at the Beyeler Foundation and its nearby Berower Park. Prior attempts had failed to secure government support in St. Louis, Missouri, and Paris. The work was self-funded through sale of photographic documentation and preparatory works, as had become standard for the couple.\\n\\n\\n=== The Gates ===\\n\\nWork began on the installation of the couple\\'s most protracted project, The Gates, in New York City\\'s Central Park in January 2005. Its full title, The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979–2005, refers to the time elapsed between the year of the artists\\' initial proposal and the year they were allowed to proceed, having received permission from the newly elected mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The Gates was open to the public from February 12–27, 2005. A total of 7,503 gates made of saffron-colored fabric were placed on paths in Central Park. They were five meters (16 ft) high and had a combined length of 37 km (23 mi). The mayor presented them with the Doris C. Freedman Award for public art. The project cost an estimated US$21 million, which the artists planned to recoup by selling project documentation.\\n\\n\\n=== Big Air Package ===\\nChristo filled the Gasometer Oberhausen from March 16 until December 30, 2013, with the installation Big Air Package. After The Wall (1999) as the final installation of the Emscher Park International Building Exhibition, Big Air Package was his second work of art in the Gasometer. The \"Big Air Package – Project for Gasometer Oberhausen, Germany\" was conceived by Christo in 2010 (for the first time without his wife Jeanne-Claude).\\nThe sculpture was set up in the interior of the industrial monument and was made of 20,350 m3 (719,000 cu ft) of translucent fabric and 4,500 m (14,800 ft) of rope. In the inflated state, the envelope, with a weight of 5.3 tonnes (5.8 short tons), reached a height of more than 90 m (300 ft), a diameter of 50 m (160 ft) and a volume of 177,000 m3 (6,300,000 cu ft). The monumental work of art was, temporarily, the largest self-supporting sculpture in the world. In the accessible interior of Big Air Package, the artist generated a unique experience of space, proportions, and light.\\n\\n\\n=== X-TO+J-C: Christo and Jeanne-Claude Featuring Works from the Bequest of David C. Copley ===\\nIn 2014, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego presented the exhibit X-TO + J-C: Christo and Jeanne-Claude Featuring Works from the Bequest of David C. Copley, one of the museum\\'s patrons and trustees who also had the largest collection of Christo and Jeanne-Claude\\'s work in the United States. X-TO + J-C featured more than fifty works by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, including pieces such as Christo\\'s evocative Package (1960), alongside drawings related to his early concealed objects: chairs, road signs, and other commonplace items. Christo himself gave a lecture in which he discussed two works that were in progress: Over the River, Project for the Arkansas River, Colorado, and The Mastaba, Project for the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n\\n=== The Floating Piers ===\\n\\nThe Floating Piers were a series of walkways installed at Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. From June 18 to July 3, 2016, visitors were able to walk just above the surface of the water from the village of Sulzano on the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Paolo. The floating walkways were made of around 200,000 polyethene cubes covered with 70,000 m2 (750,000 sq ft) of bright yellow fabric: 3 km (1.9 mi) of piers moved on the water; another 1.5 km (0.93 mi) of golden fabric continued along the pedestrian streets in Sulzano and Peschiera Maraglio. After the exhibition, all components were to be removed and recycled. The installation was facilitated by the Beretta family, owners of the oldest active manufacturer of firearm components in the world and the primary sidearm supplier of the U.S. Army. The Beretta family owns the island of San Paolo, which was surrounded by Floating Piers walkways.\\nThe work was a success with the Italian public and critics as well.\\n\\n\\n=== The London Mastaba ===\\n\\nThe London Mastaba was a temporary floating installation exhibited from June to September 2018 on The Serpentine in London. The installation consisted of 7,506 oil barrels, in the shape of a mastaba, a form of an early bench, as well as a style of tomb, in use in ancient Mesopotamia, with a flat roof and inward sloping sides. It sat on a floating platform of high-density polyethene, held in place by 32 anchors. It was 20 m (66 ft) in height and weighed 600 tonnes (660 short tons). The vertical ends were painted in a mosaic of red, blue and mauve, whilst the sloping sides were in red with bands of white.\\nSimultaneously with the display of The London Mastaba, the nearby Serpentine Gallery presented an exhibition of the artists\\' work, entitled Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Barrels and The Mastaba 1958–2018. The exhibition comprised sculptures, drawings, collages, scale-models and photographs from the last 60 years of the artists\\' work.\\nAnother Mastaba of over 400,000 oil barrels is intended to be built at Al Gharbia, 160 km (100 mi) from the city Abu Dhabi.\\n\\n\\n=== Over the River ===\\n\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude announced plans  for a future project, titled Over The River, to be constructed on the Arkansas River between Salida, Colorado, and Cañon City, Colorado, on the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains. Plans for the project call for horizontally suspending 10.8 km (6.7 mi) of reflective, translucent fabric panels high above the water, on steel cables anchored into the river\\'s banks. Project plans called for its installation for two weeks during the summer of 2015, at the earliest, and for the river to remain open to recreation during the installation. Reaction among area residents was intense, with supporters hoping for a tourist boom and opponents fearing that the project would ruin the visual appeal of the landscape and inflict damage on the river ecosystem. One local rafting guide compared the project to \"hanging pornography in a church.\" The U.S. Bureau of Land Management released a Record of Decision approving the project on November 7, 2011. Work on the project cannot begin, however, until the Bureau of Land Management issues a Notice to Proceed. A lawsuit against Colorado Parks and Wildlife was filed on July 22, 2011, by Rags Over the Arkansas River (ROAR), a local group opposed to the project. The lawsuit is still awaiting a court date.\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude\\'s inspiration for Over the River came in 1985 as they were wrapping the Pont-Neuf and a fabric panel was being elevated over the Seine. The artists began a three-year search for appropriate locations in 1992, considering some eighty-nine river locations. They chose the Arkansas River because its banks were high enough that recreational rafters could enjoy the river at the same time.\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude spent more than $6 million on environmental studies, design engineering, and wind tunnel testing of fabrics. As with past projects, Over The River would be financed entirely by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, through the sale of Christo\\'s preparatory drawings, collages, scale models, and early works of the 1950s/1960s. On July 16, 2010, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management released its four-volume Draft Environmental Impact Statement, which reported many potentially serious types of adverse impact but also many proposed \"mitigation\" options.\\nIn January 2017, after the election of President Trump, Christo canceled the controversial project citing protest of the new administration as well as tiring from the hard-fought legal battle waged by local residents.\\n\\n\\n=== L\\'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped ===\\n\\nContinuing their series of monumental \"wrapping\" projects, the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was wrapped in 30,000 square meters of recyclable polypropylene fabric in silvery blue, and 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) of red rope. Originally scheduled for autumn of 2020, it was postponed a year to Saturday, September 18 to Sunday, October 3, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its impact on the arts and cultural sector worldwide. Following Christo\\'s death, his office stated that the project would nevertheless be completed.\\nSeveral articles in the press cut the name of Jeanne-Claude on their coverage of the event leading to a debate about the suppression of the place of women in art history.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude\\'s work is held by many major public collections. The artists received the 1995 Praemium Imperiale, the 2006 Vilcek Prize, and the 2004 International Sculpture Center\\'s Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.\\nArt critic David Bourdon described Christo\\'s wrappings as a \"revelation through concealment\". Unto his critics Christo replied, \"I am an artist, and I have to have courage ... Do you know that I don\\'t have any artworks that exist? They all go away when they\\'re finished. Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain.\" Jeanne-Claude was a firm believer in the aesthetic beauty of works of art; she said, \"\\'We want to create works of art of joy and beauty, which we will build because we believe it will be beautiful.\\'\"\\nIn 2022, the Pérez Art Museum Miami presented Christo Drawings: A Gift from the Maria Bechily and Scott Hodes Collection, comprising drawings and project sketches produced by Christo and his life partner and artistic collaborator Jeane-Claude between the 1960s and the 2000s.\\n\\n\\n== Biographies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Christo ===\\n\\nChristo Vladimirov Javacheff (Bulgarian: Христо Владимиров Явашев, [xrisˈtɔ vlɐˈdimirof jaˈvaʃɛf]) was born on June 13, 1935, in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, as the second of three sons to Tzveta Dimitrova, a Macedonian Bulgarian from Thessaloniki, and Vladimir Javacheff, who worked at a textile manufacturer. Christo was shy and had a predilection for art. He received private art instruction at a young age and the support of his parents, who invited visiting artists to their house. Christo was particularly affected by events from World War II and the country\\'s fluid borders. During evacuations, he and his brothers stayed with a family in the rural hills outside town, where Christo connected with nature and handicraft.\\nChristo pursued realistic painting through the mid-1950s, a period during which Western art was suppressed in Bulgaria. He was admitted into the Sofia Academy of Fine Arts in 1953 but found the school dull and stifling. Instead, he found inspiration in Skira art books, and visiting Russian professors who were older than him and once active in Russian modernism and the Soviet avant-garde. On the weekends, academy students were sent to paint propaganda and Christo unhappily participated. He found work as a location scout for the state cinema and served three tours of duty during summer breaks. In 1956, he used an academy connection to receive permission to visit family in Prague, where the theater of Emil František Burian reinvigorated him. Amid fears of further Russian suppression in Hungary, Christo decided to flee to Vienna as a railcar stowaway. He had little money after paying the bribe, did not speak the language, had deserted during his Bulgarian military service, and feared being trapped in a refugee camp.\\nIn Vienna, he stayed with a family friend (who had not expected him), studied at the Vienna Fine Arts Academy, and surrendered his passport to seek political asylum as a stateless person. There, he supported himself with commissions and briefly visited Italy with the academy, whose program he found equally unhappy as the one before it. At the behest of a friend relocated from Sofia, he saved up to visit Geneva in late 1957. In violation of his visa, he continued to pursue commissions (whose works he would sign with his family name, reserving his given name for more serious work) and was transformed after visiting the Kunstmuseum Basel and Kunsthaus Zürich. In January 1958, he first began to wrap things, as would become his trademark, starting with a paint can. His collection of wrapped household items would be known as his Inventory. In February 1958, Christo left for Paris, having received a visa with the assistance of a Sofia academy connection.\\nIn 1973, after 17 stateless years, Christo became a United States citizen. He died at his home in New York City on May 31, 2020, at 84. No cause of death was specified. L\\'Arc de Triomphe, Wrapped, a planned work by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, went ahead posthumously in Paris in September 2021.\\n\\n\\n=== Jeanne-Claude ===\\nJeanne-Claude Denat de Guillebon (French: [ʒan klod dəna də gijəbɔ̃]) was born in Casablanca, Morocco, where her father, an army officer, was stationed. Her mother, Précilda, was 17 when she married Jeanne-Claude\\'s father, Major Léon Denat. Précilda and Léon Denat divorced shortly after Jeanne-Claude was born, and Précilda remarried three times. Jeanne-Claude earned a baccalauréat in Latin and philosophy in 1952 from the University of Tunis. After Précilda married the General Jacques de Guillebon in 1947, the family lived in Bern (1948–1951) and Tunisia (1952–1957) before returning to Paris.\\nJeanne-Claude was described as \"extroverted\" and with natural organizational abilities. Her hair was dyed red, which she claimed was selected by her husband. She took responsibility for overseeing work crews and for raising funds.\\nJeanne-Claude died in New York City on November 18, 2009, from complications due to a brain aneurysm. Her body was to be donated to science, one of her final wishes. When she died, she and Christo were at work on Over the River and the United Arab Emirates project, The Mastaba. She said, \"Artists don\\'t retire. They die. That\\'s all. When they stop being able to create art, they die.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage ===\\nChristo and Jeanne-Claude met in October 1958 when he was commissioned to paint a portrait of her mother, Précilda de Guillebon. Initially, Christo was attracted to Jeanne-Claude\\'s half-sister, Joyce. Jeanne-Claude was engaged to Philippe Planchon. Shortly before her wedding, Jeanne-Claude became pregnant by Christo. Although she married Planchon, Jeanne-Claude left him immediately after their honeymoon. Christo and Jeanne-Claude\\'s son, Cyril, was born on May 11, 1960.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\nLand art\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n=== The early work of Christo and Jeanne-Claude ===\\nMatthias Koddenberg, Christo: The Paris Sculptures 1961, Kettler Verlag, Bönen, Germany 2011\\nMatthias Koddenberg, Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Early Works 1958–64, Kettler Verlag, Bönen, Germany 2009\\nMatthias Koddenberg, \"Christo and Jeanne-Claude: Realism\\'s Newly Unveiled Face\", in: Nouveau Réalisme, exh. cat.

              "  'Ilya Iosifovich Kabakov (Russian: Илья́ Ио́сифович Кабако́в; September 30, 1933 – May 27, 2023) was a Russian–American conceptual artist, born in Dnipropetrovsk in what was then the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union. He worked for thirty years in Moscow, from the 1950s until the late 1980s. After that he lived and worked on Long Island, United States.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nIlya Iosifovich Kabakov was born on September 30, 1933, in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His mother, accountant Bertha Judelevna Solodukhina, and his father, locksmith Iosif Bentcionovitch Kabakov, were Jewish. Ilya was evacuated during World War II to Samarkand with his mother. There he started attending the school of the Leningrad Academy of Art which was evacuated to Samarkand. His classmates included the painter Mikhail Turovsky.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nAfter the World War II his family moved to Moscow. From 1945 to 1951, he studied at the Moscow Art School; in 1957 he graduated from V.I. Surikov State Art Institute, Moscow, where he specialized in graphic design and book illustration.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nUnlike many underground Soviet artists, Kabakov joined the Union of Soviet Artists in 1959 and became a full member in 1962. This was a prestigious position in the USSR and it brought with it substantial material benefits. In general, Kabakov illustrated children\\'s books for 3 to 6 months a year and then spent the remainder of his time on his own projects.\\nIn the vibrant art scene of 1970s Moscow, Ilya Kabakov\\'s unconventional talent found an unexpected champion in Dina Vierny, a distinguished gallerist with a keen eye for groundbreaking art. Vierny, after a visit in Moscow in the early 1970’s, committed to supporting artists resisting the constraints of socialist realism, discovered Kabakov. The fateful meeting occurred on the evening of January 16, 1970, when Vierny recognized Kabakov as an artist of exceptional originality, despite being unknown and prohibited from exhibiting in Moscow. Vierny\\'s genuine interest in Kabakov\\'s work transcended time, enduring for over 27 years. Despite Kabakov\\'s infrequent exhibitions in Moscow, his drawings managed to captivate international audiences. Vierny not only encouraged Kabakov to leave the Soviet Union for broader recognition but also actively supported him by acquiring a substantial number of his works. This support was not limited to Kabakov alone; Vierny, upon her return, brought back works by other non-conformist artists such as Erik Boulatov and Vladimir Yankilevsky, known as the Group of Boulevard Sretensky. Together, these artists, despite differing styles, shared a common struggle against state-imposed artistic limitations, particularly the constraints of socialist realism. Vierny\\'s commitment culminated in the groundbreaking exhibition \"Russian Avant-Garde - Moscow 1973\" at her Saint-Germain-des-Prés gallery, showcasing the diverse yet united front of non-conformist artists challenging the artistic norms of their time.\\n\\n\\n== The 1980s ==\\nBetween 1983 and 2000, Kabakov created 155 installations. Of these, one of the best known installations is The Man Who Flew Into Space From His Apartment. First created in 1985 in a secret attic studio in Moscow, Kabakov later recreated the piece in the United States at Ronald Feldman Gallery in 1988. The installation portrays a small, run-down bedroom with a large hole in the ceiling and propaganda photos covering the walls. The exhibition was widely reviewed, securing Kabakov\\'s reputation in the New York art world. \\n\\n\\n== Personal life and death ==\\nIn 1989, Kabakov began working with his niece,  curator and dealer Emilia Kanevsky, who would later become his wife and who emigrated from the USSR in 1973. Kabakov had met her when she lived in Dnipropetrovsk.  For three decades, the couple collaborated on numerous exhibitions, including Documenta in 1992, the Venice Biennale in 1993, the Whitney Biennial in 1997, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in 2004, and the Tate Modern and the Hirshhorn in 2017.\\nKabakov died on May 27, 2023, at the age of 89.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions and collectors ==\\nFollowing Mikhail Chemiakin\\'s 1995 show, Ilya Kabakov had one of the first major solo exhibitions of a living Russian artist at the new State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in 2004.\\nHis works are included in the collections of the Zimmerli Art Museum, the Centre Pompidou (Beaubourg), Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim, The Hermitage, Tretjakov Gallery (Moscow), Norway Museum Of Contemporary Art, the Kolodzei Art Foundation and museums in Columbus, Ohio, Frankfurt, and Köln, etc.\\nIn 2017 the Tate Modern in London exhibited Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Not Everyone Will Be Taken Into the Future and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. set up an exhibition Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: The Utopian Projects.\\nNational Museum of Norway (Norway) has \"Søppelmannen\" [\\'the garbage man\\'] on permanent display.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Russian artists\\nMoscow Conceptualism\\nIrina Nakhova\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nAlexander Rappaport.

              "  'Julian Schnabel (born October 26, 1951) is an American painter and filmmaker. In the 1980s, he received international attention for his \"plate paintings\" — with broken ceramic plates set onto large-scale paintings. Since the 1990s, he has been a proponent of independent arthouse cinema. Schnabel directed Before Night Falls, which became Javier Bardem\\'s breakthrough Academy Award-nominated role, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was nominated for four Academy Awards. For the latter, he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, as well as receiving nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director and the César Award for Best Director.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\nSchnabel was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family, the son of Esta (née Greenberg) and Jack Schnabel. He moved with his family to Brownsville, Texas in 1965. He received his B.F.A. at the University of Houston. After graduating, he sent an application to the Independent Study Program (ISP) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. His application included slides of his work sandwiched between two pieces of bread. He was admitted into the program and studied there from 1973 to 1975.\\nIn 1975, Schnabel visited Galveston and was introduced to the artist Joseph Glasco who had his home and studio in Galveston at that time.  Schnabel and Glasco became close friends and shared many similar interests in the arts. Later in their relationship, Schnabel influenced Glasco to set up his studio in New York, and in the late 1980s introduced Glasco to Leslie Waddington of Waddington Galleries, London where he had an exhibition.\\n\\n\\n=== Art career ===\\nSchnabel returned to Houston in 1975 and rented a studio in the Heights neighborhood. Jim Harithas, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, agreed to give him a show after Schnabel reportedly badgered him repeatedly. The eponymously titled exhibit ran from February 20 to March 7, 1976, in the parallelogram building\\'s lower gallery.\\nOn seeing the show, ARTnews critic Charlotte Moser wrote, \"Though still formative, Schnabel\\'s paintings possess a palpable presence,\" but found the work \"clearly influenced by post-minimalist artists whose intellectual ideas he might share but whose technical expertise and clarity of vision he has yet to acquire.\"\\nIt was with his first solo show, at the Mary Boone Gallery in 1979 that Schnabel had his breakthrough; all his works were sold in advance. He participated at the Venice Biennale in 1980 with Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. By the time he exhibited his work in a show jointly organized by Boone and Leo Castelli in 1981, he had become firmly established and was the youngest artist in the legendary exhibition \\'A New Spirit in Painting\\' in the Royal Academy of Arts. His now famous \"plate paintings\" — large-scale paintings set on broken ceramic plates—received a boisterous and critical reception from the art world. In 1984, he surprised the art community by moving from working with Mary Boone to exhibit at the Pace Gallery.\\nHis wild and expressive works were classed as neo-expressionism by art critics. In the years to follow Schnabel\\'s success on the art market would above all be criticised.\\nSchnabel\\'s style is characterised by very large scale paintings. He uses diverse materials such as plaster, wax, photographs, antlers, velvet and ceramics. His paintings make use of canvas, wood, muslin and even surfboards. His paintings often combine abstract and figurative elements. Due to the size, weight, and depth of his works, they are often given sculptural properties.\\nIn 2002, Schnabel painted the cover artwork for the Red Hot Chili Peppers\\' eighth studio album, By the Way. The woman featured on the cover of By the Way is Julian\\'s daughter, Stella Schnabel, who was band member John Frusciante\\'s then-girlfriend.[59] Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: \"My girlfriend\\'s father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn\\'t be offended if we didn\\'t like it, but we loved what he did. He\\'s also given us great covers for all the singles. He\\'s a true artist.\"\\nSchnabel had an exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which ran from September 1, 2010 to January 2, 2011 and occupied the entirety of the gallery\\'s fifth floor. It examined \"the rich interplay between Schnabel\\'s paintings and films\". In 2011 Museo Correr exhibited Julian Schnabel: Permanently Becoming and the Architecture of Seeing, a selected survey show of Schnabel\\'s career curated by Norman Rosenthal.\\nArt critic Robert Hughes was one of the most outspoken critics of his work; he once stated that \"Schnabel\\'s work is to painting what Stallone\\'s is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals.\" In the 2017 Swedish film The Square, set in a museum of modern art, Dominic West plays a character modeled on Schnabel.\\n\\n\\n=== Film career ===\\nSchnabel began his film career in the 1990s with the film Basquiat, a biopic on the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat (1996), followed by Before Night Falls (2000), an adaptation of Reinaldo Arenas\\' autobiographical novel, which he also produced, and which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. He directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007), an adaptation (with a screenplay by Ronald Harwood) of a French memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. The Diving Bell and the Butterfly earned him the award for best director at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Globe for best director, the Independent Spirit Award for best director, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.\\n\\nDespite the fact that producing The Diving Bell and the Butterfly might seem like a commission to do someone else\\'s work, Schnabel took on the film. According to Schnabel, I used to go up to read to Fred Hughes, Andy Warhol\\'s business partner, who had multiple sclerosis. And as Fred got worse, he ended up locked inside his body. I had been thinking that I might make a movie about Fred when his nurse, Darren McCormick, gave me Bauby\\'s memoir, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Then, in 2003, when my father was dying, the script arrived from Kennedy. So it didn\\'t feel quite like taking on a commissioned job.\\nIn 2007, Schnabel designed Lou Reed\\'s critically acclaimed \"Berlin\" Tour and released Lou Reed\\'s Berlin. In 2010, Schnabel then directed the film Miral. In May 2017, Schnabel announced plans for a film about the painter Vincent van Gogh during his time in Arles and Auvers-sur-Oise, France. The film At Eternity\\'s Gate was released in 2018 and the script was written by Schnabel, French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière, and Louise Kugelberg. The film stars Willem Dafoe as Van Gogh. Other actors include Mathieu Amalric, Mads Mikkelsen, Niels Arestrup, Oscar Isaac as Paul Gauguin and Emmanuelle Seigner as \"the woman from Arles\" or L\\'Arlésienne. \\nIn September 2023, Schnabel announced plans to direct an adaptation of In the Hand of Dante, based on the book by Nick Tosches. The movie will shoot October 2023 and is set to star Oscar Isaac.\\n\\n\\n=== Writing and recording ===\\nSchnabel published his autobiography, CVJ: Nicknames of Maitre D\\'s & Other Excerpts From Life (Random House, New York), in 1987 and released the album Every Silver Lining Has a Cloud on Island Records (Catalog #314-524 111-2) in 1995.\\nRecorded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1993, the album features guest musicians including Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Buckethead, and Nicky Skopelitis.\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\nIn 1980, he married Belgian clothing designer Jacqueline Beaurang. They have three children: two daughters – Lola, a painter and filmmaker; and Stella, a poet and actress – and a son, Vito, an art dealer.\\nHe has twin sons, Cy and Olmo, with his second wife, Spanish actress Olatz López Garmendia.\\nHis collaboration with Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal, who penned the screenplay and original source novel for Schnabel\\'s film Miral, extended beyond the movie. Schnabel was in a relationship with her from 2007 to 2011.\\nSchnabel dated Danish model May Andersen, from whom he parted ways in 2014. They have a son, who was born in June 2013.\\nSchnabel lives in New York City with his current wife Louise Kugelberg, a Swedish interior designer. She is also the co-editor and co-writer of At Eternity\\'s Gate. Schnabel maintains studios in New York City and in Montauk at the east end of Long Island. Schnabel resides in a former West Village horse stable that he purchased and converted for residential use, adding five luxury condominiums in the style of a Northern Italian palazzo. It is named the Palazzo Chupi, and it is easy to spot because it is painted pink.\\nIn 2009, Schnabel signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2019 Paez Medal of Art, New York City (VAEA).\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBruno Bischofberger\\nList of artists who created paintings and drawings for use in films\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJulian Schnabel at IMDb',\n",
              "  'Edward Francis Paschke (June 22, 1939 – November 25, 2004) was an American painter of Polish descent. His childhood interest in animation and cartoons, as well as his father\\'s creativity in wood carving and construction, led him toward a career in art. As a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago he was influenced by many artists featured in the museum\\'s special exhibitions, in particular the work of Gauguin, Picasso and Seurat.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nPaschke was born in Chicago in 1939, where he spent most of his life. He received his bachelor of fine arts degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1961, and later his master\\'s degree in art in 1970 from the same school. Drafted into the Army on November 4, 1962, he was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, where he worked in the Training Aids Department, working on projects including illustrations for publications, signs, targets and manuals to explain weapons and procedures to incoming troops. He became a regular illustrator for Playboy Magazine, specializing in colorful sexually suggestive images that reflected his own fine art.\\nIn 1976, he started to teach at Northwestern University. He was a sensitive and supportive professor, often inviting students to his Howard Street studio and forging personal relationships. He sometimes allowed his students to paint on his works-in-progress in his studio, explaining that it would keep him from falling back on his trademark \"gestures.\" He even embarked on a collaboration with Northwestern student Steve Albini of Big Black, though it is not known if any finished product came from the collaboration. \\nOn November 22, 1968, Paschke married Nancy Cohn; with whom he had a son Marc, and a daughter Sharon.\\nPaschke lived and worked in Chicago, where he died in his house on Thanksgiving day, 2004, apparently of heart failure. His wife Nancy Paschke was an artist as well and died seven weeks after him  on January 17, 2005, in Chicago.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nAlthough Paschke was inclined toward representational imagery, he learned to paint based on the principles of abstraction and expressionism. Like many Chicago artists, he had a fondness for Outsider Art, as well as Tattoo Art. There is a picture of him from the late 1970s showing his body covered in elaborate tattoos that he claimed he would often paint on himself for personal gratification.\\nHe avidly collected photographs-related visual media in all its forms, from newspapers, magazines, and posters to film, television, and video, with a preference for imagery that tended toward the risqué and the marginal. Through this he studied the ways in which these media transformed and stylized the experience of reality, which in turn impacted on his consideration of formal and philosophical questions concerning veracity and invention in his own painting. At the same time, he sought living and working situations—from factory hand to psychiatric aide—that would connect him with Chicago\\'s diverse ethnic communities as well as feed his fascination for gritty urban life and human abnormality. Thus he developed a distinctive body of work that oscillated between personal and aesthetic introspection and confronting social and cultural values.\\nIn 1968, his drawing of Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Petunia Pig was published as the back cover of Witzend number 5.\\nIn his early paintings Paschke both incorporated and challenged depictions of legendary figures by transforming them into corps exquis, such as Pink Lady (1970) where he set Marilyn Monroe’s famous head atop the suited body of an anonymous male accordion player; or Painted Lady (1971) where he redesigned screen legend Claudette Colbert as a tattooed lady fresh from a freak show. Another direction through which he explored the features and quirks of meaning and logic was in paintings of leather accessories interpreted as anthropomorphized fetish objects, such as Hairy Shoes (1971) and Bag Boots (1972).\\nIn the decades separating Pink Lady and Matinee (1987), Paschke shifted his interest from print to electronic media and a dazzling spectrum of televisual waves and flashes began to fill the paintings. Forms and images disintegrated, broken apart in the fabric of electronic disturbance and its surface. In Matinee, the face of Elvis Presley is fragmented into a field of glowing swathes of color with lips and eyes alone suggesting the human presence beneath the electronic overlay.\\nPaschke made use of an overhead projector to layer images, which he then rendered using the traditional and time-consuming medium of oil painting. He began with an underpainting in black and white, using a simple can of \"Tru-Test\" house paint, then addressed it with refined systems of colored glazing or impasto to enliven the optical and physical textures of his painting. He often used synthetic Phthalocynine colors to achieve his neon colored look. With this original and painstaking process he created a formal parallel with the black-and-white-to-color progression in the historical development of printing, film, and television images, at the same time moving the subject matter from the particular to the non-specific to allow a wider range of interpretation. In his later work, once again forms became more solidified, moving back towards certain kinds of psychologized presences and the edgy tension that characterized his earlier work.\\nUnlike most of his Pop predecessors with their unthreatening embrace of popular culture, Paschke gravitated towards the images that exemplified the underside of American values—fame, violence, sex, and money—a preference that he shared with Andy Warhol, who was one of his foremost inspirations. In the fall of 1984, he was featured on the cover of Art in America magazine, with a great review of his work offered as a powerful alternative to the then popular Neo-Expressionism that was sweeping the New York art scene. Later considered to be an artist of his own time and place, his explorations of the archetypes and clichés of media identity prefigured the appropriative gestures of the \"Pictures Generation\" and for a new generation of global artists his totemic, eye-popping paintings have come to embody the essence of cosmopolitan art.\\nHis work is included many museum collections including: the Art Institute of Chicago, the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C., Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Centre Pompidou, Paris, and Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Strasbourg.\\nMajor exhibitions include:\\n\\nEd Paschke: Selected Works 1967–1981, Renaissance Society, University of Chicago (1982, traveled to the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston)\\nEd Paschke Retrospective, Centre Pompidou, Paris (1989–1990, traveled to the Dallas Museum, Texas and the Art Institute of Chicago, 1990–1991)\\nEd Paschke: Recent Work, Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago (2003)\\nEd Paschke: Chicago Icon, A Retrospective, Chicago History Museum (2006)\\nAt the time of his death a New York critic lamented that Paschke\\'s \"contribution to the art of his time was somewhat obscured by his distance from New York.\" Since his death there have been several museum and gallery exhibitions of Paschke\\'s work, including in 2010 a museum-quality show at Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue in New York City, curated by noted pop artist Jeff Koons. As a student, Koons admired Paschke\\'s work and became his assistant in Chicago in the mid-1970s while attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Paschke would prove to be an important mentor and formative inspiration for the young artist. Paschke\\'s influence in both his subject matter and pioneering use of color continues to influence artists around the world.\\nOn June 22, 2014, a gallery in the Jefferson Park neighbourhood of Chicago opened to commemorate the works of Paschke alongside his fellow Chicago artists at the Ed Paschke Art Center.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial Ed Paschke website\\nOfficial Ed Paschke Art Center website',\n",
              "  'Douglas Gordon (born 20 September 1966) is a Scottish artist. He won the Turner Prize in 1996, the Premio 2000 at the 47th Venice Biennale in 1997 and the Hugo Boss Prize in 1998. He lives and works in Berlin, Germany.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nMuch of Gordon\\'s work is seen as being about memory and uses repetition in various forms. He uses material from the public realm and also creates performance-based videos. His work often overturns traditional uses of video by playing with time elements and employing multiple monitors.\\n\\nGordon has often reused older film footage in his photographs and videos. One of his best-known art works is 24 Hour Psycho (1993) which slows down Alfred Hitchcock\\'s film Psycho so that it lasts twenty four hours. In Between Darkness and Light (After William Blake) (1997), William Friedkin\\'s Exorcist (1973) and Henry King\\'s The Song of Bernadette (1943) – two films about adolescent girls driven by external forces – are projected on either side of a single free-standing semi-transparent screen so they can be seen simultaneously. The video installation left is right and right is wrong and left is wrong and right is right (1999) presents two projections of Otto Preminger\\'s Whirlpool (1949) side by side, with the one on the right reversed so that the two sides mirror each other; by digital means, Gordon separated individual frames of the original film so that odd-numbered ones on one side alternate with even-numbered ones on the other. Feature Film (1999) is a projection of Gordon\\'s own film of James Conlon conducting Bernard Herrmann\\'s score to Vertigo, thus drawing attention to the film score and the emotional responses it creates in the viewer. In one installation, this was placed at the top of a tall building, referencing one of the film\\'s main plot points. In Through a looking glass (1999), Gordon created a double-projection work around the climactic 71-second scene in Martin Scorsese’s film Taxi Driver (1976), in which the main character addresses the camera; the screens are arranged so that the character seems to be addressing himself. At first, the 71-second loops are in sync, but they get progressively out and then progressively back with each repetition of the whole, hourlong program.\\nOriginally conceived as a site-specific video projection for Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, Play Dead; Real Time (2003) consists of two videos projected on two large screens showing a circus elephant named Minnie ponderously performing for an off-screen trainer in the empty, spacious, white-walled gallery room. In each projection the camera circles as the elephant walks around, lies down to play dead and gets up. The footage showing Minnie’s sequences of tricks is simultaneously presented in a front and a rear life-sized projection and on a monitor, with each one depicting the same event from a range of perspectives, including close-ups of the animal\\'s eyes. Gordon also made a film about Zinedine Zidane, Zidane, un portrait du 21e siècle (2006), an idea first seen in a film by Hellmuth Costard, who, in 1970, made a film about George Best titled Football as Never Before. The feature-length film, which he co-directed with fellow artist Philippe Parreno and assembled from footage shot by seventeen synchronised cameras placed around the stadium in real time over the course of a single match, premiered outside the competition of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival before screenings at numerous international venues. k.364 premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2010.\\nGordon has also made photographs, often in series with relatively minor variations between each individual piece. His Blind Stars (2002) featured publicity photographs of mid-century movie stars in which the sitters\\' eyes were replaced by expressionless black, white or mirrored surfaces.\\nIn 2010, Gordon collaborated with Rufus Wainwright, creating the visuals for his tour which accompany Rufus\\' All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu album. In Phantom (2011), another collaboration with Wainwright, Gordon employs slow-motion film produced with a high-speed Phantom camera focusing on Wainright\\'s eye — blackened with make-up, weeping, and glaring back at the viewer, echoing melodramatic performances by stars of the silent screen.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nIn 2008, Gordon was a member of the Official Competition Jury at the 65th Venice International Film Festival. He was also a member of the jury that selected Hito Steyerl as recipient of the Käthe Kollwitz Prize in 2019.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nGordon\\'s first solo show was in 1986. In 1993, he exhibited 24 Hour Psycho in the spaces of Tramway, Glasgow, and at Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin. The Berlin show was curated by Klaus Biesenbach. In 1996, Gordon was one of the artists invited to Skulptur Projekte Münster, and in 1997 he represented Britain at the Venice Biennale. His work was the subject of a 2001 retrospective organised by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, which travelled to the Vancouver Art Gallery, Canada; Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City; and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. In 2005, he put together an exhibition at the Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin called The Vanity of Allegory. In 2006, Douglas Gordon Superhumanatural opened at the National Galleries of Scotland complex in Edinburgh, being Gordon\\'s first major solo exhibition in Scotland since he presented 24 Hour Psycho in 1993. Also in 2006, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York showed a retrospective of Gordon\\'s work, called Timeline, which was curated by Klaus Biesenbach. Another 2006 retrospective was on view at the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh. A survey of his textworks was shown at Tate Britain, London in 2010. Retrospective solo exhibitions were shown at Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt am Main in 2011 to 2012, Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 2013 and at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Melbourne in 2014. Further solo exhibitions have been held at Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany 2013, Musée D\\'art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, 2014. Gordon took part in the Biennale of Sydney 2014 and Documenta 17. In 2019, his works were exhibited at the Arsenale Institute for Politics of Representation, Venice, during the show Hey Psycho!. \\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nGallery versions of Zidane, un portrait du 21e siècle (2006) were purchased by the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. The Guggenheim collection also include Through a Looking Glass (1999) and Tattoo (for Reflection) by Gordon. Several photographs and video installations are in the Migros Museum for contemporary art in Zürich., in the Tate collection, National Galleries of Scotland, Musée D\\'art Moderne de la Ville de Paris as well as many other prestigious collections worldwide.

              "  'Takashi Murakami (村上 隆, Murakami Takashi, born February 1, 1962) is a Japanese contemporary artist. He works in fine arts (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial media (such as fashion, merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. His influential work draws from the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of postwar Japanese culture. He designed the album covers for Kanye West\\'s third studio album Graduation and West and Kid Cudi’s collaborative studio album Kids See Ghosts.\\nMurakami is the founder and President of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., through which he manages several younger artists. He was the founder and organizer of the biannual art fair Geisai.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Academic background and early career ===\\n\\nMurakami was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan.  From early on, he was a fan of anime and manga (Japanese cartoons and comics respectively), and hoped to work in the animation industry. He attended Tokyo University of the Arts to acquire the drafting skills necessary to become an animator, but eventually majored in Nihonga, the \\'traditional\\' style of Japanese painting that incorporates traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and subjects. He earned his master\\'s degree in 1988. Though he would go on to earn a Ph.D. in Nihonga (1993), he gradually became disillusioned with its insular, highly political world and started to explore more contemporary artistic styles, media, and strategies.\\nMurakami was dissatisfied with the state of contemporary art in Japan, believing it to be \"a deep appropriation of Western trends.\" Thus, much of his early work was done in the spirit of social criticism and satire. On an article naming and explaining all of Murakami\\'s pieces lies the infamous My Lonesome Cowboy, a companion to his earlier Hiropon. The sculpture is that of a naked anime character with blond spiky hair with a spiral trail of semen circling him. This piece is Murakami\\'s most expensive piece to date selling for $15,100,000 at Sotheby\\'s New York auction in 2008.  Efforts from this period include performance art (Osaka Mixer Project, 1992), parodies of the \"message\" art popular in Japan in the early \\'90s, (Dobozite Dobozite Oshamanbe, 1993), and conceptual works (e.g. Randoseru Project, 1991). He also began developing his own pop icon, \"Mr. DOB\", which would later develop into a form of self-portraiture, the first of several endlessly morphing and recurring motifs seen throughout his work. Though he garnered attention, many of his early pieces were not initially well received in Japan.\\n\\n\\n=== New York ===\\nIn 1994, Murakami received a fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council and participated in the PS1 International Studio Program in New York City for a year.  During his stay, he was exposed to and highly inspired by Western contemporary artists such as Anselm Kiefer and especially the simulationism of artists such as Jeff Koons. He established a small studio, which, together with the Hiropon Factory in Japan, became the precursor to his company Kaikai Kiki. After returning to Japan, he would develop the core concepts behind his artistic practice and begin exhibiting regularly at major galleries and institutions across Europe and America.\\n\\n\\n=== Superflat ===\\nIn 2000, Murakami published his \"Superflat\" theory in the catalogue for a group exhibition of the same name that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of color. Superflat also served as a commentary on postwar Japanese society in which, Murakami argues, differences in social class and popular taste have \\'flattened,\\' producing a culture with little distinction between \\'high\\' and \\'low\\'. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on it with the exhibitions \"Coloriage\" (2002, Fondation Cartier pour l\\'art contemporain, Paris) and \"Little Boy: The Arts of Japan\\'s Exploding Subculture\" (2005, Japan Society, New York), which was named after Little Boy. These helped introduce Japan\\'s lesser-known creative culture overseas and such curatorial projects would become an integral part of Murakami\\'s multifaceted artistic practice. In the past decade, Murakami\\'s curatorship expanded to include Kazunori Hamana, Yuji Uedaa, and Otani Workshop at Blum & Poe, New York (2016) and Juxtapox x Superflat at Vancouver Art Gallery (2016).\\nIn accordance with the Superflat concept, Murakami\\'s practice involves repackaging elements usually considered \"low\" or subcultural and presenting them in the \"high-art\" market. He then further flattens the playing field by repackaging his \"high-art\" works as merchandise, such as plush toys and T-shirts, making them available at more affordable prices.\\n\\n\\n=== Factory ===\\nIn 1996, Murakami launched the Hiropon Factory, his production workshop, in order to work on a larger scale and in a more diverse array of media. His model inherits the atelier system which has long existed in Japanese painting, printmaking and sculpture and is common to anime and manga enterprises, such as Hayao Miyazaki\\'s Studio Ghibli. In 2001, Hiropon Factory was incorporated as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations ===\\nIn 2002, at the invitation of designer Marc Jacobs, Murakami began his long-lasting collaboration with the fashion brand Louis Vuitton. He began by contributing artwork which was used in the design of a series of handbags. The series re-envisioned the company\\'s monogram and was a huge commercial success.  Though he had previously collaborated with fashion designers such as Issey Miyake Men by Naoki Takizawa, his work with Louis Vuitton made him widely known for blurring the line between \\'high art\\' and commercialism. It also elevated him to celebrity status in his home country of Japan.\\nIn 2007, Murakami provided the cover artwork for rapper Kanye West\\'s album Graduation and directed an animated music video for West\\'s song \"Good Morning.\" He also provided cover artwork for West\\'s 2018 collaboration album Kids See Ghosts with Kid Cudi.\\nFor Graduation and \"Good Morning\", Murakami would later \\'re-appropriate\\' these projects by incorporating their imagery into his paintings and sculptures, further blurring the boundaries between art and commercial branding and even questioning the existence of such a boundary.\\nAsked about straddling the line between art and commercial products, Murakami responded:\\n\\nI don\\'t think of it as straddling. I think of it as changing the line. What I\\'ve been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less defined. Both by the culture and by the post-War economic situation. Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in fact, they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of \"high art.\" In the West, it certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people will throw all sorts of stones. But that\\'s okay—I\\'m ready with my hard hat.\\nMurakami has also collaborated with a wide range of creators and industries in Japan, a prominent example being the image characters he created for the press relations campaign of the major urban real estate development Roppongi Hills.\\nIn 2009, music producer Pharrell Williams unveiled a collaborative sculpture with Murakami at Art Basel, which Williams stated \"illustrates the metaphor of value.\"\\nMurakami and McG directed short Akihabara Majokko Princess, where Kirsten Dunst sings a cover of The Vapors\\' 1980 song \"Turning Japanese\". This was shown at the \"Pop Life\" exhibition in London\\'s Tate Modern museum from October 1, 2009, to January 17, 2010. It shows Dunst dancing around Akihabara, a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan.\\nIn May 2014, with Pharrell and Kz of livetune, Murakami created a music video for the remix of the Hatsune Miku song \"Last Night, Good Night (Re:Dialed)\". The team was assembled by the YouTube channel The Creators Project, headed by Vice and Intel. The same year, Murakami\\'s anime-inspired illustrations from his first film Jellyfish Eyes, also adorned a T-shirt by Billionaire Boys Club, the brand co-founded by Pharrell and Nigo.\\nIn Fall of 2015, Takashi collaborated with Vans. The name of this collaboration was Vault By Vans x Takashi Murakami Collection. His artwork was on Vans classic slip on, apparel and skateboard decks for an illuminated time and only in selected stores. His artwork mostly consisted of his famous skull and flower designs.  \\nIn 2018, Takashi Murakami collaborated with fashion designer Virgil Abloh on a series of artworks, bringing the fashion world to the art world but ultimately transcending both to create something more. Takashi and Virgil discuss their careers and their collaboration at length in their interview for Cultured Magazine\\'s fall 2018 issue where they are featured on the cover.\\nIn March 2019, Billie Eilish released one of two official music videos for \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", one being directed and animated by Takashi Murakami. Murakami stated in a press release that the anime-style video, which was animated using motion capture technology, took eight months for him to create. The video opens with an animated version of Eilish, dressed in a neon-green shirt and shorts, eventually morphing into a spider-like monster that wreaks havoc on a miniature city. The video features the \"Blohsh\", Eilish\\'s signature logo, as well as Murakami\\'s flowers. The late rapper Juice WRLD approached Murakami to do a project several weeks before his untimely death, as a result of which, the projected could never be completed.\\nIn March 2020, J Balvin released his album Colores featuring album cover designs and artwork by Takashi Murakami. The Murakami-designed artwork was carried over to merchandise to celebrate the release of his album.\\nIn April 2020, Supreme released a Box Logo Tee featuring artwork from Murakami. All the proceeds went to HELP USA, in order to support youth and families facing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nIn 2022, a collaboration between Sir Lewis Hamilton and Murakami was announced for Hamilton\\'s \\'+44\\' fashion range. Murakami also designed Hamilton\\'s helmet for that year\\'s Suzuka Grand Prix.\\n\\n\\n=== Current ===\\nFrom 2007 to 2009, Murakami\\'s first retrospective ©Murakami traveled from the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles (its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art), to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, and lastly the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain. Sarah Thornton tracks the early stages of the exhibition\\'s planning, including in-depth curatorial meetings between Murakami and prominent museum figures, in Seven Days in the Art World. The exhibition earned widespread attention for, among other things, including a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique as one of the exhibits.\\nIn 2008, Murakami was named one of Time magazine\\'s \"100 Most Influential People\", the only visual artist included.\\nIn September 2010 Murakami became the third contemporary artist, and first Japanese, to exhibit at the Palace of Versailles in France, filling 15 rooms and the park with his sculptures, paintings, a decorative carpet, and lamps.\\nOn June 21, 2011, Google featured a doodle tagged as \"First Day of Summer\" which was created by Murakami. This was accompanied by a Winter Solstice doodle for the Southern Hemisphere.\\nIn February 2012, Murakami opened an exhibition in Doha, Qatar. Titled Murakami-Ego, this showed around 60 old works alongside new ones designed especially for the exhibition. Among the new ones, a 100-metre long wall painting depicting the suffering of the Japanese people after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\\n\\nIn March 2013, livetune released a PV, directed by Murakami, for Redial, featuring Hatsune Miku.\\nIn April 2013, Murakami\\'s first feature film was released in theaters across Japan. Jellyfish Eyes (originally titled \"Me me me no kurage)) is a live-action movie featuring CGI characters designed by Murakami called Friend.\\nIn 2019, Murakami was working on his own album of original folk songs, inspired by Japanese group Happy End.\\n\\n\\n== Technique ==\\n\\nMurakami\\'s art encompasses a wide range of media and is generally described as superflat. It has been noted for its use of color, incorporation of motifs from Japanese traditional and popular culture, flat/glossy surfaces, and content that could be described at once as \"cute\", \"psychedelic\", or \"satirical\". Among his best known recurring motifs are smiling flowers, Mr. DOB, mushrooms, skulls, Buddhist iconography, and the sexual complexes of otaku culture. One of Murakami\\'s most famous pieces known as \\'Hiropon\\' brings to light his embrace of otaku culture. The sculpture that was created in 2001 is said to show the \"otaku culture and its strange, shocking sexuality in full force\". The concept of the smiling flowers was revealed in an interview to be \"evoked repressed, contradictory emotions and collective trauma of Japanese locals triggered by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings back in 1945.\" In addition to large paintings such as 727 (permanent collection Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Tan Tan Bo Puking – a.k.a. Gero Tan, he has also produced sculptures, balloons, \\'all-over\\' wallpaper installations, animated works, prints, posters, and assorted merchandise.\\n\\n\\n=== Strategic approach ===\\n\\nMurakami has expressed since early on a frustration with the lack of a reliable and sustainable art market in postwar Japan. Largely for this reason, he formulated a strategy wherein he would first establish himself in the Western art world and then import himself back to Japan, building a new type of art market in the process.  In order to create something rooted in his own Japanese culture and history but still fresh and valid internationally, he began searching for something that could be considered \\'uniquely Japanese.\\' After concluding that elements of \\'high\\' art were confounding at best, he began to focus on Japan\\'s \\'low\\' culture, especially anime and manga, and the larger subculture of otaku. His artistic style and motifs (cute [kawaii]/disturbing anime-esque characters rendered in bright colors, flat and highly glossy surfaces, life-size sculptures of anime figurines) derived from this strategy.  This is demonstrated in his whimsical Cosmos Ball from 2000, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Market value ===\\nOn November 11, 2003, ARTnews has described Murakami\\'s work as being in great demand. Hiropon (1997), satirical sculpture, standing a bit over 7 feet tall, of an anime character with oversized lactating breasts whose milk stream forms a jump rope made of fiberglass, sold for $427,500 at Christie\\'s auction house in May 2002.  Miss ko2 (1996), a 6-foot-tall model of an anime-inspired blonde girl in a red and white maid outfit, was sold for $567,500 in 2003, and was put up for auction in 2010, where it sold for 22.9 million HKD. In May 2008, My Lonesome Cowboy (1998), an anime-inspired sculpture of a masturbating boy whose semen stream forms a lasso, sold for $15.2 million at Sotheby\\'s, making it his most highly valued piece. Murakami\\'s current net-worth is estimated to be around US$100 million, and the value of his works continue to rise in today\\'s market.\\n\\n\\n== Kaikai Kiki ==\\n\\nMurakami has incorporated his operations as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. in Japan (2001), Kaikai Kiki New York, LLC in New York (2001), and Kaikai Kiki LA, LLC in Los Angeles (2010). The name \"Kaikai Kiki\" (カイカイキキ) which means \"brave, strong and sensitive\", was borrowed from a critic in the late 17th century who used it to describe the paintings of Eitoku Kano.\\nKaikai Kiki executes Murakami\\'s wide range of artistic endeavors and consists of both offices and production studios. In addition to handling the production and promotion of Murakami\\'s artwork and projects, the company manages the careers of young artists, organizes international art projects, produces and promotes merchandise, and handles the organization and operation of the Geisai art fair.\\nHaving earned success and recognition internationally, Murakami has devoted himself to nurturing and supporting the careers of a younger generation of Japanese artists. Likening the operation to that of a record label, he offers both logistic support and practical career advice. Through this endeavor, he also seeks to build an original and sustainable art market in Japan.\\nIn 2008, Kaikai Kiki converted the basement space beneath its Tokyo office into an art gallery. Kaikai Kiki Gallery has held exhibitions not only for the artists under its management but also international names such as Mark Grotjahn and Friedrich Kunath. All exhibitions are curated by Murakami.\\nA second Gallery called Hidari Zingaro was opened in 2010 and has now expanded to include four separate locations within the Nakano Broadway shopping mall in Nakano, Tokyo.\\nThe company and its galleries represent a number of prominent international artists including Takashi Murakami, KAWS, Mark Grotjahn, Anselm Reyle, Matthew Monahan, Seonna Hong,  Aya Takano, Chiho Aoshima, ob, Mr., Fantasista Utamaro, Virgil Abloh, Michael Rikio Ming Hee Ho, Kazumi Nakamura, Otani Workshop, Yūji Ueda,  Chinatsu Ban, Rei Sato, and Friedrich Kunath. The company began in Saitama, Japan in Asaka City, and now has offices in Tokyo, Japan in the Moto-Azabu neighborhood and New York as well as affiliates in Berlin and Taiwan.\\n\\n\\n== Geisai ==\\nFrom 2002 until 2014, Murakami organized a unique direct-participatory art fair called Geisai. It was held once per year in Japan and once per year in a different city, such as Taipei, or Miami. Rather than give space to pre-screened galleries, the fair allowed artists to create their own booths and interact directly with potential buyers.\\n\\n\\n== NFTs ==\\nMurakami was involved in NFTs  from April 2021 but his first project, \"Murakami.Flowers\",  was suspended by the artist shortly after its release due to his concern about his little knowledge of the topic. The idea of creating NFTs stemmed from his financial problems during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2021 he collaborated with Nike-owned company RTFKT Studios on CloneX avatar projects. In January 2022 he announced resuming work on  \"Murakami.Flowers\".\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nMurakami, Takashi \"Geijutsu Kigyoron\"\\u3000ISBN 978-4-344-01178-6\\nMurakami, Takashi \"Geijutsu Tosoron\" ISBN 978-4-344-01912-6\\nMurakami, Takashi \"Summon Monsters?

              "  'Sophie Calle (born 9 October 1953) is a French writer, photographer, installation artist, and conceptual artist. Calle\\'s work is distinguished by its use of arbitrary sets of constraints, and evokes the French literary movement known as Oulipo. Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like tendency to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.\\nSince 2005, Calle has taught as a professor of film and photography at European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. She has lectured at the University of California, San Diego in the Visual Arts Department. She has also taught at Mills College in Oakland, California.\\nExhibitions of Calle\\'s work took place at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia; Musée d\\'Art et d\\'Histoire du Judaïsme, Paris; Paula Cooper Gallery, New York; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium; Videobrasil, SESC Pompeia, São Paulo, Brazil; Museum of Modern Art of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art, Tilburg, Netherlands. She represented France at the Venice Biennale in 2007.\\nIn 2017 she was shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize for her publication My All (Actes Sud, 2016). In 2019 she was the recipient of the Royal Photographic Society\\'s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1979–1981 ===\\nIn Suite Venitienne (1979), Calle followed a man she met at a party in Paris to Venice, where she disguised herself and followed him around the city, photographing him. Calle\\'s surveillance of the man, who she identifies only as Henri B., includes black and white photographs accompanied by text.\\nCalle\\'s first artistic work was The Sleepers (Les Dormeurs), a project in which she invited passers-by to occupy her bed. Some were friends, or friends of friends, and some were strangers to her. She served them food and photographed them every hour.\\nIn order to execute her project The Hotel (1981), she was hired as a chambermaid at a hotel in Venice where she was able to explore the writings and objects of the hotel guests. Insight into her process and its resulting aesthetic can be gained through her account of  this project: \"I spent one year to find the hotel, I spent three months going through the text and writing it, I spent three months going through the photographs, and I spent one day deciding it would be this size and this frame...it\\'s the last thought in the process.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Mid- and late 1980s ===\\nOne of Calle\\'s first projects to generate public controversy was Address Book (1983). The French daily newspaper Libération invited her to publish a series of 28 articles. Having recently found an address book on the street (which she photocopied and returned to its owner), she decided to call some of the telephone numbers in the book and speak with the people about its owner. To the transcripts of these conversations, Calle added photographs of the man\\'s favorite activities, creating a portrait of a man she never met, by way of his acquaintances. The articles were published, but upon discovering them, the owner of the address book, a documentary filmmaker named Pierre Baudry, threatened to sue the artist for invasion of privacy. As Calle reports, the owner discovered a nude photograph of her, and demanded the newspaper publish it, in retaliation for what he perceived to be an unwelcome intrusion into his private life.\\nAnother of Calle\\'s noteworthy projects is titled The Blind (1986), for which she interviewed blind people, and asked them to define beauty. Their responses were accompanied by her photographic interpretation of their ideas of beauty, and portraits of the interviewees.\\nCalle has created elaborate display cases of birthday presents given to her throughout her life; this process was detailed by Grégoire Bouillier in his memoir The Mystery Guest: An Account (2006). According to Bouillier, the premise of his story was that \"A woman who has left a man without saying why calls him years later and asks him to be the \\'mystery guest\\' at a birthday party thrown by the artist Sophie Calle. And by the end of this fashionable—and utterly humiliating—party, the narrator figures out the secret of their breakup.\"\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nIn 1996, Calle asked Israelis and Palestinians from Jerusalem to take her to public places that became part of their private sphere, exploring how one\\'s personal story can create an intimacy with a place. Inspired by the eruv, the Jewish law that permits to turn a public space into a private area by surrounding it with wires, making it possible to carry objects during the Sabbath, the Erouv de Jérusalem is exposed at Paris\\'s Musée d\\'Art et d\\'Histoire du Judaïsme.\\nThe same year, Calle released a film titled No Sex Last Night which she created in collaboration with American photographer Gregory Shephard. The film documents their road trip across America, which ends in a wedding chapel in Las Vegas. Rather than following the genre conventions of a road trip or a romance, the film is designed to document the result of a man and woman who barely knew each other, embarking on an intimate journey together.\\nCalle asked writer and filmmaker Paul Auster to \"invent a fictive character which I would attempt to resemble\" and served as the model for the character Maria in Auster\\'s 1992 novel Leviathan. This mingling of fact and fiction so intrigued Calle that she created the works of art created by the fictional character, which included a series of color-coordinated meals. These works are documented in her publication Double Game (1999).\\nAuster later challenged Calle to create and maintain a public amenity in New York City. The artist\\'s response was to augment a telephone booth on the corner of Greenwich and Harrison Streets in Manhattan with a note pad, a bottle of water, a pack of cigarettes, flowers, cash, and sundry other items. Every day, Calle cleaned the booth and restocked the items, until the telephone company removed and discarded them. This project is documented in  The Gotham Handbook (1998).\\nIn 1999 Calle exhibited the installation \"Appointment\" especially conceived for the Freud Museum in London, working with the ideas of her private desires. In Room with a View (2002), Calle spent the night in a bed installed at the top of the Eiffel Tower. She invited people to come to her and read her bedtime stories in order to keep her awake through the night. The same year, Calle had her first one-woman show, a retrospective, at the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\n\"Douleur Exquise\" (exquisite pain) was commissioned in 2003. She reluctantly chose to spend three months in Japan, deciding to make the journey take a month by taking the train through Moscow and through Siberia, then through Beijing, then to Hong Kong. She was supposed to meet her lover in New Delhi, but he didn\\'t turn up, instead sending her a telegram which said he was in an accident and couldn\\'t come. She found out that he only had an infected finger, a felon, and that he had actually found another woman. She took a photograph every day until the day they were supposed to meet in New Delhi, and wrote about how much she looked forward to meeting him. The second half of the book was all about the pain of the heartbreak. She would write about the horrible memory of the conversation where she realized he was breaking up with her on one page, and ask people to tell her their worst memory, which was placed on the right. Over the days, her story became shorter and shorter as her pain dissipated over the time. The juxtaposition of everyone\\'s terrible memories also played down the pain of a simple breakup.\\nCalle\\'s text Exquisite Pain was adapted into a performance in 2004 by Forced Entertainment, a theatrical company based in Sheffield, England.\\nAt the 2007 Venice Biennale, Calle showed her piece Take Care of Yourself, named after the last line of the email her ex sent her. Calle asked friends, acquaintances, and recommended women of all ages—including a parrot and a hand puppet—to interpret the break-up e-mail and presented the results in the French pavilion. Calle explains the piece as follows: \"I received an email telling me it was over.  I didn\\'t know how to respond.  It was almost as if it hadn\\'t been meant for me.  It ended with the words, \\'take care of yourself.\\' And so I did.  I asked 107 women, chosen for their profession or skills, to interpret this letter.  To analyze it, comment on it, dance it, sing it.  Exhaust it.  Understand it for me.  Answer for me.  It was a way of taking the time to break up.  A way of taking care of myself.\" Jessica Lott, winner of the Frieze Writer\\'s Prize for her review of the piece, described it thus: \"Take Care of Yourself is a break-up letter (Calle\\'s) then-boyfriend (Grégoire Bouillier, dubbed ‘X’) sent her via e-mail. Calle took the e-mail, and the paralyzing confusion that accompanies the mind\\'s failure to comprehend heartbreak, and distributed it to 107 women of various professions, skills and talents to help her understand it – to interpret, analyze, examine and perform it to gain perspective on her perplexing situation. Calle insists that she did not need the other women\\'s sentiments for herself, but to ensure that the piece was well-rounded. The result of this seemingly obsessive, schoolyard exercise is paradoxically one of the most expansive and telling pieces of art on women and contemporary feminism to pass through (the major art centres) in recent years\". At her gallery shows, Calle frequently supplies suggestion forms on which visitors are encouraged to furnish ideas for her art, while she sits beside them with an uninterested expression.\\nIn 2009/2010, a major retrospective exhibition of her work, including Take Care of Yourself, The Sleepers, Address Book and others, was held opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London. In 2010 another major exhibition opened in Denmark at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nIn 2011 her work True Stories was installed at the historic 1850 House at the Pontalba Building at Jackson Square in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana as part of the Prospect 2 Contemporary Art Festival. The house, an historic museum that is managed as part of the Louisiana State Museum, is furnished with historic furniture  as it was in the mid-19th century. The artist inserted her own, personal historical objects and ephemera, with short, narrative explanatory text, into the scenes, affecting the notion that she had occupied the house shortly before the viewers\\' arrival.\\nIn 2012, Calle\\'s The Address Book was published for the first time in its entirety. In 2015, Suite Vénitienne was redesigned and republished.\\nIn 2014, Calle’s work Rachel, Monique was displayed at the Episcopal Church of Heavenly Rest in New York City. It involved video Calle took of her mother, Monique Sindler, on her deathbed, as well as excerpts of her diary, read by actress Kim Cattrall. Calle took her mother’s portrait and jewelry and buried them at the North Pole. Portraits of her doing so were also on exhibition.\\nIn 2017, Calle was commissioned to create a public artwork for Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, Here Lie the Secrets of the Visitors of Green-Wood Cemetery. The piece will remain in the cemetery for 25 years.\\n\\n\\n== Critical analysis ==\\nChristine Macel described Calle\\'s work as a rejection of the Poststructuralist notion of the \"death of the author\" by working as a \"first-person artist\" who incorporates her life into her works and, in a way, redefines the idea of the author.\\nAngelique Chrisafis, writing in The Guardian, called her \"the Marcel Duchamp of emotional dirty laundry\". She was among the names in Blake Gopnik\\'s 2011 list \"The 10 Most Important Artists of Today\", with Gopnik arguing, \"It is the unartiness of Calle\\'s work—its refusal to fit any of the standard pigeonholes, or over anyone\\'s sofa—that makes it deserve space in museums.\"\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nSignificant contributions by other authors are noted.\\n\\nSuite Vénitienne.

              "  'John Armleder (born 1948) is a Swiss performance artist, painter, sculptor, critic, and curator. His work is based on his involvement with Fluxus in the 1960s and 1970s, when he created performance art pieces, installations, and collective art activities that were strongly influenced by John Cage. However, Armleder\\'s position throughout his career has been to avoid associating his artistic practice with any type of manifesto.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nArmleder was born in Geneva, as the son of a hotelier (owners of Le Richemond). He studied at the École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Genève (1966–67), and at the Barry Summer School at Glamorgan College of Education in Barry, Wales (1969).\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nIn 1969, with Patrick Lucchini and Claude Rychner, Armleder founded the Groupe Ecart in Geneva, from which stemmed the Galerie Ecart and its associated performance group and publications. The Groupe Ecart was particularly important in Europe during the 1970s and 1980s, not only through its activity as an independent publishing house, but also because it introduced in Switzerland—and sometimes in Europe—a large number of notable artists, including Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol. Armleder was later associated with the Neo-Geo artistic movement in the 1980s.\\nArmleder frequently examines the context in which art is displayed and views the exhibition as a medium in its own right. Since the 1990s, he has created installations, paintings, wall paintings, sculptures and what he calls Furniture Sculptures—installations that usually juxtapose furniture with monochrome or abstract paintings, either literally on the furniture or a canvas hanging nearby. His work has varied greatly in form, and has, since the beginning, used chance as a method of producing the final forms that pieces take, much like John Cage. He often uses a dense scenographic hanging style, putting individual works into proximity and creating installation-like exhibitions.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nIn 1986, Armleder represented Switzerland at the Venice Biennale. In 2004, a retrospective exhibition of his works on paper was shown at the Kunsthalle Zürich, Switzerland, and later traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia. In the winter of 2006–2007, a large exhibition including works from all eras of his career was shown at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (Mamco) in Geneva, Switzerland. In April 2013, Armleder had a solo show at the Dairy Art Centre in London.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nArmleder\\'s work is held in the permanent collections of numerous museums including the Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts, Lausanne, the Staedel Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, among other institutions.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDocumentation of recent John Armleder exhibitions\\nHeyoka Magazine Interview with John LeKay\\nJohn Armleder, Venice Exhibition\\nJohn Armleder, \"About Nothing\" ICA Philadelphia review by Steven Stern, Frieze',\n",

              "  'Pierre Huyghe (born 11 September 1962) is a French contemporary artist, who works in a variety of media from films and sculptures to public interventions and living systems. He lives and works in Paris and New York. \\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nPierre Huyghe (pronounced hweeg) was born in Paris in 1962. He studied at the École nationale supérieure des Arts décoratifs in Paris, and graduated in 1985.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHuyghe participated in the Okayama Summit in 2016, and was the event\\'s artistic director in 2019. In an interview in Ocula Magazine with Stephanie Bailey, Huyghe explained that he chose \\'artists who construct worlds that have the capacity to endlessly change, rather than as makers of things\\' — a quality that translates to his own practice.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nHuyghe has received a number of awards, including the Nasher Prize (2017), Kurt Schwitters Prize (2015); Roswitha Haftmann Award (2013), the Smithsonian Museum’s Contemporary Artist Award (2010), the Hugo Boss Prize from the Guggenheim Museum (2002), and a DAAD in Berlin (1999–2000). In 2024, Huyghe was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix Artistique by the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca.\\n\\n\\n== Work and themes ==\\nHuyghe has been working with time-based situations and site-specific installations since the early 1990s. His works consist of such diverse forms as objects, films, photographs, drawings, music, fictional characters, and full-fledged ecosystems, in effect treating exhibition and its ritual as an object in itself.\\n\\n\\n=== Role playing ===\\nIn Blanche-Neige, (1997), Huyghe revealed the face and story of Lucie Dolène, the French voiceover artist whom Walt Disney hired to do the French language version of Snow White. When Disney subsequently reissued the film and used Dolmen\\'s voice without her permission, she sued the company for the right to own her own voice. Huyghe\\'s film is a simply edited headshot of Dolène recounting her experience in her unmistakable (to French ears) voice. Blanche-Neige was a more pointed followup to Dubbing, (1996), in which Huyghe screens Tobe Hooper\\'s film Poltergeist but focuses his camera on the fifteen actors who have been hired to do the French voiceovers rather than the projection of the film itself, which is only visible to the actors. In 1999, Huyghe and fellow French artist Philippe Parreno turned this idea of the subjective performance of language into the body of a fictional character by purchasing the rights to a manga figure whom they dubbed \"Annlee\". They then invited other artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pierre Joseph, Mélik Ohanian, Joe Scanlan, and Rirkrit Tiravanija to produce various works utilizing the character Annlee, the sum of which became the traveling group exhibition No Ghost Just A Shell. After several exhibitions, they transferred the character\\'s copyright to the Annlee Association—a legal entity owned by Annlee, thus ensuring her simultaneous freedom and death.\\n\\n\\n=== Fiction, memory, and place ===\\nHuyghe\\'s two-channel video The Third Memory (1999), commissioned by The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago and later exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, takes as its starting point Sidney Lumet\\'s 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon, starring Al Pacino in the role of the bank robber John Wojtowicz. Huyghe\\'s video reconstructs the set of Lumet\\'s film, but he allows Wojtowicz himself, now a few dozen years older and out of jail, to tell the story of the robbery. Huyghe juxtaposes images from the reconstruction with footage from Dog Day Afternoon, demonstrating that Wojtowicz\\'s memory has been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. Streamside Day Follies (2003) was commissioned by the DIA Art Foundation, New York, and involved the integrated relationship between three locales: a fictionalized community in the Hudson Valley that is launching an equally fictional neighborhood festival; a film verité that captures the proceedings of the fledgling festival; and DIA\\'s former Manhattan exhibition space. The exhibition entailed the regular creation of a fourth space in which the fictional community, the film, and the gallery would converge. Huyghe accomplished this by designing four walls suspended from motorized tracks that were programmed to intermittently organized themselves into a darkened enclosure in which the Streamside Day Follies film would screen. When the film was finished, the walls would disperse. A Journey that Wasn\\'t (2005) was commissioned by the Public Art Fund and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and entailed similar intersections of a fictional place, a film, and live convergence. As a film work, A Journey that Wasn\\'t juxtaposes a sailing expedition from Tierra del Fuego in search of an uncharted island off the coast of Antarctica, with the recording (and re-recording) of its symphonic score at the Wollman ice rink in Central Park. The symphonic score was composed by Joshua Cody and featured guitar soloist Elliott Sharp.\\nThe Host and the Cloud (2010) is a feature-length film that was shot entirely within the dormant building that had housed the National Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions, Paris. The rambling, melancholy, somewhat sci-fi narrative is structured around the celebrations of Halloween, Valentine\\'s Day, and May Day. The film\\'s premier at Marian Goodman Gallery, New York, was accompanied by several of Huyghe\\'s Zoodram sculptures, elaborate aquariums featuring exotic sea creatures that are not unlike the captive human ecosystem depicted in The Host and the Cloud. For dOCUMENTA(13) (2012) Pierre Huyghe created Untilled (2011–2012), a compost site within a baroque garden, a non hierarchical association that included a sculpture of a reclining nude with a head obscured by a swarming beehive, aphrodisiac and psychotropic plants, a dog with a pink leg, and an uprooted oak tree from Joseph Beuys’ 7,000 Oaks, among other elements. Untilled was ranked third in The Guardian\\'s Best Art of the 21st Century list, with critic Adrian Searle calling it a \"wondrous work\" and \"an elegy for a dying world\".\\n\\n\\n=== Anthropomorphism ===\\nHuman Mask (2014) is a film set in post-disaster Fukushima that depicts the listless activity of a trained monkey-servant dressed in the mask of a young woman.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nStech, Fabian (2006).

              "  'Laura Phillips \"Laurie\" Anderson (born June 5, 1947) is an American avant-garde artist, musician and filmmaker whose work spans performance art, pop music, and multimedia projects. Initially trained in violin and sculpting, Anderson pursued a variety of performance art projects in New York during the 1970s,  focusing particularly on language, technology, and visual imagery. She achieved unexpected commercial success when her song \"O Superman\" reached number two on the UK singles chart in 1981.\\nAnderson\\'s debut album Big Science was released in 1982 and has since been followed by a number of studio and live albums. She starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave. Anderson\\'s creative output has also included theatrical and documentary works, voice acting, art installations, and a CD-ROM. She is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several musical devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nLaura Phillips Anderson was born in Glen Ellyn, Illinois, on June 5, 1947, the daughter of Mary Louise (née Rowland) and Arthur T. Anderson She had seven siblings, and on weekends she studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago and played with the Chicago Youth Symphony.\\nShe graduated from Glenbard West High School. She attended Mills College in California, and after moving to New York in 1966, graduated in 1969 from Barnard College with a B.A. magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, studying art history. In 1972, she obtained an M.F.A. in sculpture from Columbia University.\\nHer first performance-art piece — a symphony played on automobile horns — was performed in 1969. In 1970, she drew the underground comix Baloney Moccasins, which was published by George DiCaprio. In the early 1970s, she worked as an art instructor, as an art critic for magazines such as Artforum, and illustrated children\\'s books—the first of which was titled The Package, a mystery story in pictures alone.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1970s ===\\n\\nAnderson performed in New York during the 1970s.  One of her most-cited performances, Duets on Ice, which she conducted in New York and other cities around the world, involved her playing the violin along with a recording while wearing ice skates with the blades frozen into a block of ice; the performance ended only when the ice had melted away. Two early pieces, \"New York Social Life\" and \"Time to Go\", are included in the 1977 compilation New Music for Electronic and Recorded Media, along with works by Pauline Oliveros and others. Two other pieces were included on Airwaves, a collection of audio pieces by various artists. She also recorded a lecture for Vision, a set of artist\\'s lectures released by Crown Point Press as a set of six LPs.\\nMany of Anderson\\'s earliest recordings remain unreleased or were issued only in limited quantities, such as her first single, \"It\\'s Not the Bullet that Kills You (It\\'s the Hole)\". That song, along with \"New York Social Life\" and about a dozen others, was originally recorded for use in an art installation that consisted of a jukebox that played the different Anderson compositions, at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York City. Among the musicians on these early recordings are Peter Gordon on saxophone, Scott Johnson on guitar, Ken Deifik on harmonica, and Joe Kos on drums. Photographs and descriptions of many of these early performances were included in Anderson\\'s retrospective book Stories from the Nerve Bible.\\nDuring the late 1970s, Anderson made a number of additional recordings that were either released privately or included on compilations of avant-garde music, most notably releases by the Giorno Poetry Systems label run by New York poet John Giorno, an early intimate of Andy Warhol. In 1978, she performed at the Nova Convention, a major conference involving many counter-culture figures and rising avant-garde musical stars, including William S. Burroughs, Philip Glass, Frank Zappa, Timothy Leary, Malcolm Goldstein, John Cage, and Allen Ginsberg. She also worked with comedian Andy Kaufman in the late 1970s.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nIn 1980, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1982, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts—Film. In 1987, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate in the fine arts from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.\\nAnderson became widely known outside the art world in 1981 with the single \"O Superman\", originally released in a limited quantity by B. George\\'s One Ten Records, which ultimately reached number two on the British charts. The sudden influx of orders from the UK (prompted partly by British station BBC Radio 1 playlisting the record) led to Anderson signing a seven-album deal with Warner Bros. Records, which re-released the single.\\n\"O Superman\" was part of a larger stage work titled United States and was included on the album Big Science. Prior to the release of Big Science, Anderson returned to Giorno Poetry Systems to record the album You\\'re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With; Anderson recorded one side of the double-LP set, with William S. Burroughs and John Giorno recording a side each, and the fourth side featured a separate groove for each artist. This was followed by the back-to-back releases of her albums Mister Heartbreak and United States Live, the latter of which was a five-LP (and, later, four-CD) recording of her two-evening stage show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She also appeared in a television special produced by Nam June Paik broadcast on New Year\\'s Day 1984, titled \"Good Morning, Mr. Orwell\".\\n\\nShe next starred in and directed the 1986 concert film Home of the Brave and also composed the soundtracks for the Spalding Gray films Swimming to Cambodia and Monster in a Box.  During this time, she also contributed music to Robert Wilson\\'s Alcestis at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also hosted the PBS series Alive from Off Center during 1987, after having produced the short film What You Mean We? for the series the year before. What You Mean We? introduced a new character played by Anderson: \"The Clone\", a digitally altered masculine counterpart to Anderson who later \"co-hosted\" with her when she did her presenting stint on Alive from Off Center. Elements of The Clone were later incorporated into the titular \"puppet\" of her later work, Puppet Motel. In that year, she also appeared on Peter Gabriel\\'s album So, in the song \"This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\".\\nRelease of Anderson\\'s first post-Home of the Brave album, 1989\\'s Strange Angels, was delayed for more than a year in order for Anderson to take singing lessons. This was due to the album being more musically inclined (in terms of singing) than her previous works. The single \"Babydoll\" was a moderate hit on the Modern Rock Charts in 1989.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nIn 1991, she was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. In the same year, Anderson appeared in The Human Face, a feature arts documentary directed by artist-filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson for BBC television. Anderson was the presenter in this documentary on the history of the face in art and science. Her face was transformed using latex masks and digital special effects as she introduced ideas about the relationship between physiognomy and perception. Her varied career in the early 1990s included voice-acting in the animated film The Rugrats Movie.  In 1994, she created a CD-ROM titled Puppet Motel, which was followed by Bright Red, co-produced by Brian Eno, and another spoken-word album, The Ugly One with the Jewels. This was followed by an appearance on the 1997 charity single \"Perfect Day\".\\nIn 1996, Anderson performed with Diego Frenkel (La Portuária) and Aterciopelados for the AIDS benefit album Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin produced by the Red Hot Organization.\\nAn interval of more than half a decade followed before her next album release. During this time, she wrote a supplemental article on the cultural character of New York City for the Encyclopædia Britannica and created a number of multimedia presentations, most notably one inspired by Moby-Dick (Songs and Stories from Moby Dick, 1999–2000). One of the central themes in Anderson\\'s work is exploring the effects of technology on human relationships and communication.\\nStarting in the 1990s, Anderson and Lou Reed, whom she had met in 1992, collaborated on a number of recordings together. Reed contributed to the tracks \"In Our Sleep\" from Anderson\\'s Bright Red, \"One Beautiful Evening\" from Anderson\\'s Life on a String, and \"My Right Eye\" and \"Only an Expert\" from Anderson\\'s Homeland, which Reed also co-produced. Anderson contributed to the tracks \"Call on Me\" from Reed\\'s collaborative project The Raven, \"Rouge\" and \"Rock Minuet\" from Reed\\'s Ecstasy, and \"Hang On to Your Emotions\" from Reed\\'s Set the Twilight Reeling.\\nIn fall 1998, Artist Space, New York presented an exhibit of Anderson’s work from 1970s to 1980s, along with her 1990s work, Whirlwind.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\n\\nLife on a String appeared in 2001, by which time she signed a new contract with another Warner Music label, Nonesuch Records. Life on a String was a mixture of new works (including one song recalling the death of her father) and works from the Moby Dick presentation. In 2001, she recorded the audiobook version of Don DeLillo\\'s novel The Body Artist. Anderson went on tour performing a selection of her best-known musical pieces in 2001. One of these performances was recorded in New York City a week after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and included a performance of \"O Superman\". This concert was released in early 2002 as the double CD Live in New York.\\nIn 2003, Anderson produced albums with French musicians La Jarry and Hector Zazou and also performed with them. Zazou\\'s album Strong Currents (2003), which brought together a number of well-known soloists, features her alongside Melanie Gabriel, Irene Grandi and Jane Birkin, among others. She became NASA\\'s first artist-in-residence in the same year, which inspired her performance piece The End of the Moon. She was part of the team that created the opening ceremony for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens and later that year, she collaborated with choreographer Trisha Brown and filmmaker Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo on the acclaimed multimedia project O Zlozony/O Composite for the Paris Opera Ballet. The ballet premiered at the Opera Garnier in Paris in December 2004. She mounted a succession of themed shows and composed a piece for Expo 2005 in Japan. In 2005, Anderson visited Russia\\'s space program—the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre and mission control—with The Arts Catalyst and took part in The Arts Catalyst\\'s Space Soon event at the Roundhouse to reflect on her experiences. \\n\\nIn 2005, her exhibition The Waters Reglitterized opened at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York City. According to the press release by Sean Kelly, the work is a diary of dreams and their literal recreation as works of art. This work, created in the process of re-experiencing or re-working her dreams while awake, uses the language of dreams to investigate the dream itself. The resulting pieces include drawings, prints, and high-definition video. The installation ran until October 22, 2005.\\nIn 2006, Anderson was awarded a Residency at the American Academy in Rome. She narrated Ric Burns\\' Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film, which was first televised in September 2006 as part of the PBS American Masters series. She contributed a song to Plague Songs, a collection of songs related to the 10 Biblical plagues. Anderson also performed in Came So Far for Beauty, the Leonard Cohen tribute event held in the Point Theatre, Dublin, Ireland, on October 4–5, 2006. In November 2006, she published a book of drawings based on her dreams, titled Night Life.\\nMaterial from Homeland was performed at small work-in-progress shows in New York throughout May 2007, most notably at the Highline Ballroom on May 17–18, supported by a four-piece band with spontaneous lighting and video visuals mixed live throughout the performances by Willie Williams and Mark Coniglio, respectively. A European tour of the Homeland work in progress then took place, including performances on September 28–29, 2007, at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin; on October 17–19 at the Melbourne International Arts Festival; in Russia at the Moscow Dom Muzyky concert hall on April 26, 2008. The work was performed across the Atlantic in Toronto, Canada, on June 14, 2008, with husband Lou Reed, making the \"Lost Art of Conversation\" a duet with vocals and guitar, with his ambling style contrasting with Anderson\\'s tightly wound performance. Anderson\\'s Homeland Tour performed at several locations across the United States as well, such as at the Ferst Center for the Arts, Atlanta, Georgia; The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City; and Harris Theater for Music and Dance in Millennium Park, Chicago, Illinois, co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\n\\nIn February 2010, Laurie Anderson premiered a new theatrical work, titled Delusion, at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games.  This piece was commissioned by the Vancouver 2010 Cultural Olympiad and the Barbican Centre, London. Anderson was honored with the Women\\'s Project Theater Woman of Achievement Award in March 2010. In May/June 2010, Anderson curated the Vivid Live festival in Sydney, Australia, together with Lou Reed. Her new album Homeland was released on June 22. She performed \"Only an Expert\" on July 15, 2010, on the Late Show with David Letterman, and her song \"Gravity\\'s Angel\" was featured on the Fox TV show So You Think You Can Dance the same day. She appears as a guest musician on several tracks from experimental jazz musician Colin Stetson\\'s 2011 album New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges.\\nAnderson developed a theatrical work titled \"Another Day in America\". The first public showings of this work-in-progress took place in Calgary, Alberta, in January 2012 as part of Theatre Junction Grand\\'s 2011–12 season and One Yellow Rabbit\\'s annual arts festival, the High Performance Rodeo. Anderson was named the Inaugural Distinguished Artist-In-Residence at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in May 2012. In March 2013, an exhibition of Anderson\\'s work entitled Laurie Anderson: Language of the Future, selected works 1971-2013 at the Samstag Museum was part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts in Adelaide, South Australia. Anderson performed her Duets on Ice outside the Samstag on opening night.\\nAnderson received the Honorary Doctor of Arts from the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture in 2013. In June/July 2013, Anderson performed \"The Language of the Future\" and guest curated at the River to River Festival in New York City. In November 2013, she was the featured Guest of Honor at the B3 Biennale of the Moving Image in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2018, Anderson contributed vocals to a re-recording of the David Bowie song \"Shining Star (Makin\\' My Love)\", originally from Bowie\\'s 1987 album Never Let Me Down. She was asked to join the production by producer Mario J. McNulty, who knew that Anderson and Bowie had been friends.\\nOn February 10, 2019, at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, held in Los Angeles, Anderson and Kronos Quartet\\'s Landfall won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance. It was Anderson\\'s first collaboration with Kronos Quartet and her first Grammy award, and was the second Grammy for Kronos. Inspired by her experience of Hurricane Sandy, Nonesuch Records said, \"Landfall juxtaposes lush electronics and traditional strings by Kronos with Anderson\\'s powerful descriptions of loss, from water-logged pianos to disappearing animal species to Dutch karaoke bars.\"\\n\\nChalkroom is a virtual reality work by Laurie Anderson and Taiwanese artist Hsin-Chien Huang in which the reader flies through an enormous structure made of words, drawings, and stories. To the Moon, a collaboration with Hsin-Chien Huang, premiered at the Manchester International Festival on July 12, 2019. A 15-minute virtual reality artwork, To the Moon allows audience members to explore a moon that features donkey rides and rubbish from Earth in a non-narrative structure. Alongside, a film shows the development of the new work.\\n\\n\\n=== 2020s ===\\n\\nLaurie Anderson was appointed the 2021 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University and presented a series of six lectures titled Spending the War Without You: Virtual Backgrounds over the course of the spring and fall semesters.\\nIn 2021, Anderson created a show on the second floor of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., titled \"The Weather\" and described by The New York Times as \"a sort of nonretrospective retrospective of one of America\\'s major, and majorly confounding, modern artists\".\\nDuring the summer of 2023, Laurie Anderson created \"Looking into a Mirror Sideways\", an exhibit that highlights various different styles of her art techniques. In this particular art show, \"everything that she sees and experiences feeds into the things that she makes\". This exhibit opened at the Moderna Museet, located in Stockholm, Sweden. Since opening, this artwork has been Anderson’s biggest solo show in Europe.\\nWhile in Europe, Anderson teamed up with Sexmob, a jazz band that resides in New York. Sexmob and Anderson toured Europe where they performed multiple versions of her songs, but adding a twist to them all. This tour was seen as \"an attempt at defying gravity, resisting the pull, [and] reverting the downward fall\".\\nIn 2024, Anderson withdrew from a guest professorship at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen, Germany, after university officials objected to her support of a \"Letter Against Apartheid\" organised by Palestinian artists, calling for \"an immediate and unconditional cessation of Israeli violence against Palestinians\".\\n\\n\\n== Inventions ==\\nAnderson has invented several experimental musical instruments that she has used in her recordings and performances. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she collaborated with Interval Research to develop an instrument she called a \"talking stick\", a six-foot-long (1.8 m) baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds.\\n\\n\\n=== Tape-bow violin ===\\nThe tape-bow violin is an instrument created by Laurie Anderson in 1977. It uses recorded magnetic tape in place of the traditional horsehair in the bow, and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. Anderson has updated and modified this device over the years. She can be seen using a later generation of this device in her film Home of the Brave during the Late Show segment in which she manipulates a sentence recorded by William S. Burroughs. This version of the violin used MIDI-based audio samples, triggered by contact with the bow.\\n\\n\\n=== Talking stick ===\\nThe talking stick is a six-foot-long baton-like MIDI controller. It was used in the Moby-Dick tour in 1999–2000. She described it in program notes as follows:\\n\\nThe Talking Stick is a new instrument that I designed in collaboration with a team from Interval Research and Bob Bielecki. It is a wireless instrument that can access and replicate any sound. It works on the principle of granular synthesis. This is the technique of breaking sound into tiny segments, called grains, and then playing them back in different ways. The computer rearranges the sound fragments into continuous strings or random clusters that are played back in overlapping sequences to create new textures. The grains are very short, a few hundredths of a second. Granular synthesis can sound smooth or choppy depending on the size of the grain and the rate at which they\\'re played. The grains are like film frames. If you slow them down enough, you begin to hear them separately.\\n\\n\\n=== Voice filters ===\\nA recurring motif in Anderson\\'s work is the use of an electric pitch-shifting voice filter that deepens her voice into a masculine register, a technique that Anderson has referred to as \"audio drag\". Anderson has long used the resulting character in her work as a \"voice of authority\" or conscience, although she later decided that the voice had lost much of its authority and instead began using the voice to provide historical or sociopolitical commentary, as it is used on \"Another Day in America\", a piece from her 2010 album Homeland.\\nFor much of Anderson\\'s career, the voice was nameless or called the Voice of Authority, although as early as 2009 it was dubbed Fenway Bergamot at Lou Reed\\'s suggestion. The cover of Homeland depicts Anderson in character as Bergamot, with streaks of black makeup to give her a moustache and thick, masculine eyebrows.\\nIn \"The Cultural Ambassador\", a piece on her album The Ugly One with the Jewels, Anderson explained some of her perspective on the character:\\n\\n(Anderson:) I was carrying a lot of electronics so I had to keep unpacking everything and plugging it in and demonstrating how it all worked, and I guess I did seem a little fishy—a lot of this stuff wakes up displaying LED program readouts that have names like Atom Smasher, and so it took a while to convince them that they weren\\'t some kind of portable espionage system. So I\\'ve done quite a few of these sort of impromptu new music concerts for small groups of detectives and customs agents and I\\'d have to keep setting all this stuff up and they\\'d listen for a while and they\\'d say: So um, what\\'s this? And I\\'d pull out something like(Bergamot:) this filter, and say, now this is what I like to think of as the voice of authority. And it would take me a while to tell them how I used it for songs that were, you know, about various forms of control, and they would say, now why would you want to talk like that? And I\\'d look around at the SWAT teams, and the undercover agents, and the dogs, and the radio in the corner, tuned to the Super Bowl coverage of the war. And I\\'d say, take a wild guess.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nShe moved to New York in 1966 and now lives in Tribeca. Anderson met singer-songwriter Lou Reed in 1992, and she was married to him from April 2008 until his death in 2013.\\nAnderson is a long-time student of Buddhism and meditation. She first learned meditation on a retreat with the Insight Meditation Society in 1977. She has since become a student of Tibetan Buddhist teacher Mingyur Rinpoche.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Studio albums ===\\n\\n\\n=== Spoken word albums ===\\nThe Ugly One with the Jewels (1995)\\nHeart of a Dog (Soundtrack) (2015)\\n\\n\\n=== Live albums ===\\nUnited States Live (boxed set) (1984) US No. 192\\nLive in New York (2002)\\n\\n\\n=== Compilation albums ===\\nTalk Normal: The Laurie Anderson Anthology (2000)\\n\\n\\n=== Audio book ===\\nThe Body Artist by Don DeLillo (2001)\\n\\n\\n=== Collaborations ===\\nAirwaves (1977 ~ One Ten Records); various artists compilation including three tracks by Anderson\\nYou\\'re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With with William S.

Over the years she has performed on recordings by other musicians such as Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, and Jean Michel Jarre. She also contributed lyrics to the Philip Glass album Songs from Liquid Days, and contributed a spoken-word piece to a tribute album in honor of John Cage.\\n\\n\\n== Music videos ==\\n\\nFormal music videos have been produced for:\\n\\n\"O Superman\"\\n\"Sharkey\\'s Day\"\\n\"This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)\"\\n\"Language Is a Virus\" (from Home of the Brave)\\n\"Beautiful Red Dress\"\\nIn addition, in lieu of making another music video for her Strange Angels album, Anderson taped a series of one- to two-minute \"Personal Service Announcements\" in which she spoke about issues such as the U.S. national debt and the arts scene.

              "  'Danelle Bergstrom (born 1957) is an Australian visual artist known for landscapes and portraits of significant Australians and International figures.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nBergstrom was born in Sydney. She attended Hunters Hill High School and studied art at the Julian Ashton Art School (1973-1979) and earned a Bachelor\\'s of Art Education at Alexander Mackie CAE. Her sister is Antarctic ecologist Dr Dana Bergstrom. Bergstrom began her career in the 1980s as a high school art teacher. She moved into tertiary education as Head of Department in a visual design college in the 1990s. She began exhibiting works in the 1980s, in major art prizes and solo shows by the 1990s.\\nBergstrom has two works in the collection of the Australian National Portrait Gallery, one of Australian aviator Nancy Bird Walton entitled Pioneer, and another work entitled Vivisector of the Australian playwright David Williamson.\\nBetween 2007 and 2017 Bergstrom completed 24 public portrait commissions, including portraits of all six Chief Justices of the Northern Territory Supreme Court as part of the court\\'s centenary celebration. These are exhibited in the main hall of the Supreme Court in Darwin. Many of her commissioned portraits are found in the collections of Australian courthouses, universities, museums and private collections internationally.\\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Bergstrom\\'s notable portraits included Sir Tim Smit, President Tarja Halonen of Finland, Chancellor Ulrika Wolf-Knutts.\\nIn 2023, Bathurst Regional Art Gallery presented a major career survey exhibition, entitled \\'Afterglow\\', presenting key works from the last 25 years of the artist’s practice.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and prizes ==\\nBetween 1995 and 2016, Bergstrom was a finalist nine times of the most prestigious portraiture art prize in Australia, the Archibald Prize, awarded Highly Commended in 2004 and the Packing Room Prize twice in 1995 and 2007.\\nBergstrom has been a finalist at the Portia Geach Memorial Portrait Prize at the SH Irvin Gallery fifteen times between the years 1993 and 2015, winning the People Choice Award five times.\\n\\n\\n== Portraits ==\\nBergstrom has painted portraits of many notable people. She often uses more than one canvas in her portraits to create a time sequence or capture different aspects of her subject. She described her tryptic of Marget Olley saying: \"Using three images in one work became important in expressing time and movement in the final concept: our conversations together.

              "  'Joan Snyder (born April 16, 1940) is an American painter from New York. She is a MacArthur Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellow (1974).\\nSnyder first gained public attention in the early 1970s with her gestural and elegant \"stroke paintings,\" which used the grid to deconstruct and retell the story of abstract painting. By the late seventies, Snyder had abandoned the formality of the grid. She began more explicitly incorporating symbols and text, as the paintings took on a more complex materiality. These early works were included in the 1973 and 1981 Whitney Biennials and the 1975 Corcoran Biennial.\\nOften referred to as an autobiographical or confessional artist, Snyder\\'s paintings are narratives of both personal and communal experiences. Through a fiercely individual approach and persistent experimentation with technique and materials, Snyder has extended the expressive potential of abstract painting, inspiring generations of emerging artists.\\nSnyder currently lives and works in Brooklyn and Woodstock, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nJoan Snyder was born on April 16, 1940, in Highland Park, New Jersey.  She received her BA in Sociology, from Douglass College in 1962 and her MFA from Rutgers University in 1966.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1969, Snyder married photographer Larry Fink. She gave birth to their daughter, Molly, in 1979. They were divorced in 1985. Her grandson Elijah was born in 2012.\\nIn 2011, Snyder married her partner of 28 years, Margaret Cammer,  a retired New York State Acting Supreme Court Judge and the former NY Deputy Administrative Judge of The New York City Civil Court.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nWhile living on a New Jersey farm in 1962, Snyder worked in a studio on the Raritan River in New Brunswick, creating some of her earliest paintings of farm and landscape scenes, as well as expressionist portraits. In the mid to late 60\\'s she was working explicitly with the idea of female sensibility, using materials in her paintings such as lentil seeds, flocking, thread, glitter and gauze. Snyder describes her processes involving non-art materials as a type of ritual act for the painting. Snyder\\'s ideas often take form in her paintings through other means other than paint such as music, poetry and words to further push the intent of her pieces. These works eventually led to Snyder\\'s seminal stroke paintings in the late 60\\'s and early \\'70\\'s.  Snyder worked alongside artists such as Mary Heilmann, Jennifer Bartlett and Harriet Korman during the 1960s, all of whom were attempting to bring more process into their art making.\\n\\n\\n== Stroke paintings ==\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, Snyder began to explore paint as subject, reconstructing abstract painting through gestural strokes on canvas over a gridded background. These paintings, more commonly known as her \\'stroke\\' paintings, were included in the 1973 and 1981 Whitney Biennials as well as the Corcoran Biennial in 1975.\\nFollowing the stroke paintings in the mid 70s, Snyder\\'s work once again revisited female sensibility and the work more vigorously explored materiality. By the late 70s she abandoned the formality of the grid and began to more explicitly incorporate symbols and text in her paintings.\\n\\n\\n== The feminist movement ==\\nIn 1971, Snyder founded the Mary H. Dana Women Artist Series, \"the oldest continuous running exhibition space in the United States dedicated to making visible the work of emerging and established contemporary women artists.\"\\nShe was a founding member of Heresies, a Feminist Publication On Art and Politics, alongside artists and critics including Ida Applebroog, Joyce Kozloff, Lucy Lippard, Nina Yankowitz, Joan Braderman, Sue Heinemann and Miriam Schapiro, among many others.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nSnyder is the recipient of a 1974 National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, a 1983 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, a 2007 MacArthur Fellowship, and a 2016 Arts & Letters Award in Art from the American Academy of Arts & Letters.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nSnyder\\'s work can be found in many public collections including:\\n\\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL\\nBrooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY\\nDallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TX\\nGuggenheim Museum, New York, NY\\nHarvard Art Museums, Cambridge, MA\\nHigh Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA\\nThe Jewish Museum, New York, NY\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY\\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA\\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY\\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\\nNational Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC\\nNeuberger Museum, State University of New York at Purchase, NY\\nThe Phillips Collection, Washington, DC\\nRose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham MA\\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA\\nSmith College Museum of Art, Northampton, MA\\nSpeed Art Museum, Louisville, KY\\nTang Museum, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY\\nTate Modern, London, England\\nUniversity of Arizona Museum of Art, Tucson, AZ\\nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, VA\\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY\\nWichita Art Museum, Wichita, KS\\nZimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nJoan Snyder Website\\nJoan Snyder at ArtCyclopedia\\nJoan Snyder at Artnet\\nInterview with Phong Bui\\nOral history interview with Joan Snyder, 2010 February 25-26, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution',\n",
              "  'Wim Delvoye (born 1965 in Wervik, West Flanders) is a Belgian neo-conceptual artist widely recognized for combining in his inventive and often shocking projects philosophical ideas, innovative use of materials, and a passion for craftsmanship. He blurs the boundaries between traditional art and the digital realm of contemporary artistic practices, creating aerodynamic, mathematically precise, and intricate sculptures that take the art and design to new levels of invention, while offering a perceptive and playful commentary on contemporary society. As the critic Robert Enright wrote in the art magazine Border Crossings, \"Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created\". Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Ghent (Belgium). \\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nDelvoye was raised in Wervik, a small town in West Flanders, Belgium. He did not have a religious upbringing but has been influenced by the Roman Catholic architecture that surrounded him. In a conversation with Michaël Amy of The New York Times, Delvoye stated, \"I have vivid memories of crowds marching behind a single statue as well as of people kneeling in front of painted and carved altarpieces… Although I was barely aware of the ideas lurking behind these types of images, I soon understood that paintings and sculptures were of great importance\".\\nGrowing up, Delvoye attended exhibitions with his parents, and his love of drawing eventually led him to art school, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Ghent). Delvoye has said that the pessimistic expectations for Belgian art students freed him, essentially making him realize that he \"had nothing to lose\". Shortly thereafter, Delvoye began painting over wallpaper and carpets, coloring in the existing patterns and defying the tendency towards free expression vibrant in the art world at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nDelvoye’s artistic exploration encompasses various aspects of art history, drawing inspiration both from Gothic cathedrals and 19th-century sculptures and the works by Bosch, Brueghel, and Warhol. Simultaneously, he unveils the beauty in everyday objects. Employing a baroque approach that oscillates between homage and irreverence, Delvoye appropriates and distorts motifs that captivate his imagination.\\nDelvoye considers himself an originator of concepts—he is attracted initially to the theory behind pieces, instead of the act of creating art itself. After 1990, specialists directed by Delvoye have executed most of his work. \\nIn the late 80s, Delvoye applied Dutch ornamental traditions (i.e. Delft china patterns and coats of arms) to mundane objects like shovels, gas cylinders, and ironing boards. \\nIn 1992, Delvoye received international recognition with the presentation of his Mosaic at Documenta IX, a symmetrical display of glazed tiles featuring photographs of his own excrement. The organizer of Documenta IX, Jan Hoet claimed, \"The strength of Wim Delvoye lies in his ability to engineer conflict by combining the fine arts and folk art, and playing seriousness against irony\". \\nIn the 1990s, Delvoye embarked on a daring experiment with tattoo art, specifically by tattooing the skin of pigs. He exhibited live pigs and dried skins of pigs, both covered in tattoos drawn from the domain of bikers and punk rockers: skulls, daggers, snakes, hearts, and Harley Davidson logos. In 2004, he extended this medium by exhibiting stuffed pigs and by expanding his tattoo vernacular to include Louis Vuitton patterns and images of Disney princesses. By adorning pigskin with these iconic images, the artist raises thought-provoking questions about the commercial value of brands and challenges the conventional expectations of consumer society.\\nAs of the 2000s Delvoye radicalized the critical function of art, exploring the boundaries of commodity art, setting up his Cloaca-project. The machine that simulates the human digestive system, from the process of feeding with various mix of food to the production of the realistic wastes, Cloaca is based on real scientific and technical expertise. It is composed of successive receptacles containing acids, digestive juices, bacteria and enzymes, maintained at a temperature of 37.2°C. Marked by a logo that appears to be a mocking cross between the Mr.Clean and the Coca-Cola logo, Cloaca acts not as a metaphor, but as a concretization of the mechanisms of the modern economy. Its feeding is a demonstrative waste of product that reflects the commercialized mass market loaded with an added value. As an artwork that creates new artwork, it paradoxically gains a new added commercial value that unveils the possibility for endless market manipulation.\\nWith the body of Gothic works that evolved since the early 2000s Delvoye walks a thin line between exploring artistic styles of the past and monumentality – by highlighting the medieval Gothic, interpreting it with contemporary themes and industrial techniques, he is aiming to create a new form of contemporary architecture. The works made of a laser cut corten steel plates reproduce neo-Gothic tracery. The ornaments on the works are not so much used as decorative quotations but as patterns of value and permanence in the modern era.\\n\\n\\n== Cloaca ==\\n\\nDelvoye is perhaps best known for his digestive machine, Cloaca, which he unveiled at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, after eight years of consultation with experts in fields ranging from plumbing to gastroenterology. As a comment on the Belgians\\' love of fine dining, Cloaca is a large installation that turns food into feces, allowing Delvoye to explore the digestive process. In his large mechanism, food begins at a long, transparent bowl (mouth), travels through a number of machine-like assembly stations, and ends in hard matter which is separated from liquid through a cylinder. Delvoye collects and sells the realistically smelling output, suspended in small jars of resin at his Ghent studio. When asked about his inspiration, Delvoye stated that everything in modern life is pointless. The most useless object he could create was a machine that serves no purpose at all, besides the reduction of food to waste. Cloaca has appeared in many incarnations, including Cloaca Original, Cloaca – New & Improved, Cloaca Turbo, Cloaca Quattro, Cloaca N° 5, and Personal Cloaca. Delvoye also sold specially printed toilet paper as a souvenir of the exhibit. In 2016, 5 rolls from the 2007 Mudam Luxembourg exhibit were offered for re-sale for US$300 through an online vendor.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissioned Cloaca for MONA ===\\nPreviously, Delvoye claimed that he would never sell a Cloaca machine to a museum as he could never trust that the curator would maintain the installation properly. However, after two years of discussion with David Walsh, Delvoye agreed to construct a custom Cloaca built specifically for the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania. The new installation is suspended from the museum ceiling in a room custom-built for it.\\n\\n\\n== Art Farm ==\\nThough Delvoye started tattooing pig skins taken from slaughterhouses in the United States in 1992, he began to tattoo live pigs in 1997. Delvoye was interested in the idea that \"the pig would literally grow in value,\" both in a physical and economic sense. He ultimately moved the operation to an Art Farm in China in 2004. The pigs have been inked with a diverse array of designs, including the trivial, such as skulls and crosses, to Louis Vuitton designs, to designs dictated by the pig\\'s anatomy\". In an interview with ArtAsiaPacific\\'s Paul Laster, Delvoye described the process of tattooing a live pig, \"we sedate it, shave it and apply Vaseline to its skin\".\\n\\n\\n== Gothic works ==\\nDelvoye is additionally well known for his “gothic” style work. In 2001, Delvoye, with the help of a radiologist, had several of his friends paint themselves with small amounts of barium, and perform explicit sexual acts in medical X-ray clinics. He then used the X-ray scans to fill gothic window frames instead of classic stained glass. Delvoye suggests that radiography reduces the body to a machine. When he was not an active participant, Delvoye observed from a computer screen in another room, allowing the subjects enough distance to perform normally, although Delvoye has described the whole operation as \"very medical, very antiseptic\". Delvoye also creates oversized laser-cut steel sculptures of objects typically found in construction (like a cement truck), customized in seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque style. These structures juxtapose \"medieval craftsmanship with Gothic filigree\". Delvoye brings together the heavy, brute force of contemporary machinery and the delicate craftsmanship associated with Gothic architecture.\\nIn a 2013 show in New York City, Delvoye showed intricate laser-cut works combining architectural and figurative references with shapes such as a Möbius band or a Rorschach inkblot.\\n\\n\\n== Selected public collections ==\\nSMAK, Ghent, Belgium\\nFondation Cartier, Paris, France \\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, Netherlands \\nGuggenheim Museum, New York, USA \\nMUDAM, Luxembourg \\nMuHKA, Antwerp, Belgium \\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, USA \\nMusée du Louvre, Paris, France \\nCentre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France \\nMONA, Tasmania \\nThe Margulies Collection, Miami, USA \\nSalama Bint Hamdan al Nahyan Foundation, Abu Dhabi, UAE \\nUffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy\\n\\n\\n== Solo Exhibitions ==\\nWim Delvoye at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, 07 Mar 2016 — 13 May 2016, TMoCA, Tehran, Iran. \\nWim Delvoye, 02 July 2016 — 08  Jan 2017, MUDAM, Luxemburg.  \\nWim Delvoye, 14 Jun 2017 — 01 Jan 2018, Museum Tinguely, Basel, Switzerland. \\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nWim Delvoye\\'s website\\nWim Delvoye at Sperone Westwater, New York\\nWim Delvoye at ARNDT Berlin\\nWim Delvoye on Artnet\\n\"Cloaca\" exhibition in the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (2002)\\n\"Cloaca\" – An Interview with Josefina Ayerza\\nArtist\\'s page at Gary Tatintsian Gallery website\\nCatalogue Gary Tatintsian Gallery',\n",
              "  'Richard  William Hamilton  (24 February 1922 – 13 September 2011) was an English painter and collage artist. His 1955 exhibition Man, Machine and Motion (Hatton Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne) and his 1956 collage Just what is it that makes today\\'s homes so different, so appealing?, produced for the This Is Tomorrow exhibition of the Independent Group in London, are considered by critics and historians to be among the earliest works of pop art. A major retrospective of his work was at Tate Modern in 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nHamilton was born in Pimlico, London on  24 February 1922. Despite having left school with no formal qualifications, he managed to gain employment as an apprentice working at an electrical components firm, where he discovered an ability for draughtsmanship and began to do painting at evening classes at Saint Martin\\'s School of Art and at the Westminster School of Art. In 1938, he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Arts.\\nAfter spending World War II working as a technical draftsman, he re-enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools but was expelled in 1946 on grounds of \"not profiting from the instruction\". Loss of his student status forced Hamilton to carry out National Service. After two years at the Slade School of Art, University College London, Hamilton began exhibiting his work at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), where he also produced posters and leaflets. He taught at the Central School of Art and Design from  1952 until 1966.\\n\\n\\n== 1950s–1960s ==\\nHamilton\\'s early work was much influenced by D\\'Arcy Wentworth Thompson\\'s 1917 text On Growth and Form. In 1951, Hamilton staged an exhibition called Growth and Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. A pioneering form of installation art, it featured scientific models, diagrams and photographs presented as a unified artwork. In 1952, at the first Independent Group meeting, held at the ICA, Hamilton was introduced to Eduardo Paolozzi\\'s seminal presentation of collages produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s that are now considered to be the first standard bearers of Pop Art. Also in 1952, he was introduced to the Green Box notes of Marcel Duchamp through Roland Penrose, whom Hamilton had met at the ICA. At the ICA, Hamilton was responsible for the design and installation of a number of exhibitions including one on James Joyce and The Wonder and the Horror of the Human Head that was curated by Penrose. It was also through Penrose that Hamilton met Victor Pasmore who gave him a teaching post in the Fine Art Department of Durham University at Newcastle upon Tyne, which lasted until 1966. Among the students Hamilton tutored at Newcastle in this period were Rita Donagh, Mark Lancaster, Tim Head, Roxy Music founder Bryan Ferry and Ferry\\'s visual collaborator Nicholas de Ville. Hamilton\\'s influence can be found in the visual styling and approach of Roxy Music.  He described Ferry as \"his greatest creation\". Ferry repaid the compliment, naming him in 2010 as the living person he most admired, saying \"he greatly influenced my ways of seeing art and the world\".\\nHamilton gave a 1959 lecture, \"Glorious Technicolor, Breathtaking Cinemascope and Stereophonic Sound\", a phrase taken from a Cole Porter lyric in the 1957 musical Silk Stockings. In that lecture, which sported a pop soundtrack and the demonstration of an early Polaroid camera, Hamilton deconstructed the technology of cinema to explain how it helped to create Hollywood’s allure. He further developed that theme in the early 1960s with a series of paintings inspired by film stills and publicity shots.\\nThe post at the ICA also afforded Hamilton the time to further his research on Duchamp, which resulted in the 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp\\'s Green Box, which comprised Duchamp\\'s original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton\\'s 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in the Fine Art Department at King\\'s College, Durham (now Newcastle University). Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton\\'s contribution to the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. Just what is it that makes today\\'s homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This Is Tomorrow, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. Just what is it that makes today\\'s homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged as one of the first pieces of pop art. Hamilton\\'s written definition of what \"pop\" is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton\\'s definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: \"Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business\", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.\\nThe success of This Is Tomorrow secured Hamilton further teaching assignments in particular at the Royal College of Art from 1957 to 1961, where he promoted David Hockney and Peter Blake. During this period Hamilton was also very active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and produced a work parodying the then leader of the Labour Party Hugh Gaitskell for rejecting a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In the early 1960s he received a grant from the Arts Council to investigate the condition of the Kurt Schwitters Merzbau in Cumbria. The research eventually resulted in Hamilton organising the preservation of the work by relocating it to the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle University Fine Art Department.\\nIn his works, Hamilton frequently incorporated the materials of consumer society. Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing? (1956) used American magazines, brought back from the United States by John McHale and Magda Cordell.\\nHamilton also incorporated pieces of plastic directly into his collages.  In Pin-up (1961), a mixed-media work exploring the female nude, sculpted plastic was used for the breasts of the nude figure. $he (1959–1961) incorporated a plastic holographic eye, given to Hamilton by Herbert Ohl.\\n The use of plastics has created significant challenges in conserving Hamilton\\'s works.  As early as 1964, when Pin-up and $he were loaned for a solo show of Hamilton\\'s works at the Hanover Gallery in London, they were found to be cracked, with plastic lifting off the supporting surfaces.  Hamilton experimented with materials, including plywood, acrylic glass, and plasticizers, and worked closely with conservators to repair his works and develop better techniques for incorporating and conserving plastics in artworks.\\nIn 1962 his first wife Terry was killed in a car accident. In part to recover from her loss, in 1963 Hamilton travelled for the first time to the United States for a retrospective of the works of Marcel Duchamp at the Pasadena Art Museum, where, as well as meeting other leading pop artists, he was befriended by Duchamp. Arising from this Hamilton curated the first British retrospective of Duchamp\\'s work, and his familiarity with The Green Box enabled Hamilton to make copies of The Large Glass and other glass works too fragile to travel. The exhibition was shown at the Tate Gallery in 1966.\\nIn 1968, Hamilton appeared in a Brian De Palma film titled Greetings where Hamilton portrays a pop artist showing a \"Blow Up\" image. The film was Robert De Niro\\'s first motion picture, and the first film in the United States to appeal an X rating.\\n\\nFrom the mid-1960s, Hamilton was represented by Robert Fraser and even produced a series of prints, Swingeing London, based on Fraser\\'s arrest, along with Mick Jagger, for possession of drugs. This association with the 1960s pop music scene continued as Hamilton became friends with Paul McCartney resulting in him producing the cover design and poster collage for the Beatles\\' White Album.\\nIn 1969, Hamilton appeared in a documentary by filmmaker James Scott, in which he discussed the Swingeing London series and his preoccupation with mass media through a selection of his own work.\\n\\n\\n== 1970s–2011 ==\\nDuring the 1970s, Richard Hamilton enjoyed international acclaim with a number of major exhibitions being organised of his work. Hamilton had found a new companion in painter Rita Donagh. Together they set about converting North End, a farm in the Oxfordshire countryside, into a home and studios. \"By 1970, always fascinated by new technology, Hamilton was redirecting advances in product design into fine art, with the backing of xartcollection, Zurich, a young company that pioneered the production of multiples with the aim of bringing art to a wider audience.\" Hamilton realised a series of projects that blurred the boundaries between artwork and product design including a painting that incorporated a state-of-the-art radio receiver and the casing of a Dataindustrier AB computer. During the 1980s Hamilton again voyaged into industrial design and designed two computer exteriors: OHIO computer prototype (for a Swedish firm named Isotron, 1984) and DIAB DS-101 (for Dataindustrier AB, 1986). As part of a television project, 1987 BBC series Painting with Light  Hamilton was introduced to the Quantel Paintbox and subsequently purchased one for his studio to produce and modify his work.\\nFrom the late 1970s Hamilton’s activity was concentrated largely on investigations of printmaking processes, often in unusual and complex combinations. In 1977–78 Hamilton undertook a series of collaborations with the artist Dieter Roth that also blurred the definitions of the artist as sole author of their work.\\nIn 1992, Richard Hamilton was commissioned by the BBC to recreate his famous art piece, Just What Is It That Makes Today\\'s Homes So Different, So Appealing? but only this time, as to what he felt the average household would be like during the 1990s.  Instead of the male body builder, he used an accountant working at a desk.  Instead of the female icon, he used a world class female body builder.\\nIn 1981 Hamilton began work on a trilogy of paintings based on the conflict in Northern Ireland after watching a television documentary about the \"Blanket\" protest organized by IRA prisoners in Long Kesh Prison, officially known as The Maze. The citizen (1981–1983) shows IRA prisoner Hugh Rooney portrayed as Jesus, with long flowing hair and a beard. Republican prisoners had refused to wear prison uniforms, claiming that they were political prisoners. Prison officers refused to let \"the blanket protesters\" use the toilets unless they wore prison uniforms. The republican prisoners refused, and instead smeared the excrement on the wall of their cells. Hamilton explained (in the catalogue to his Tate Gallery exhibition, 1992), that he saw the image of \"the blanket man as a public relations contrivance of enormous efficacy. It had the moral conviction of a religious icon and the persuasiveness of the advertising man\\'s dream soap commercial - yet it was a present reality\".  The subject (1988–89) shows an Orangeman, a member of an order dedicated to preserve Unionism in Northern Ireland. The state (1993) shows a British soldier on a \"foot\" patrol on a street. The citizen was shown as part of \"A Cellular Maze\", a 1983 joint exhibition with Donagh.\\nFrom the late 1940s Richard Hamilton was engaged with a project to produce a suite of illustrations for James Joyce\\'s Ulysses.  In 2002, the British Museum staged an exhibition of Hamilton\\'s illustrations of James Joyce\\'s Ulysses, entitled Imaging Ulysses. A book of Hamilton\\'s illustrations was published simultaneously, with text by Stephen Coppel. In the book, Hamilton explained that the idea of illustrating this complex, experimental novel occurred to him when he was doing his National Service in 1947. His first preliminary sketches were made while at the Slade School of Art, and he continued to refine and re-work the images over the next 50 years. Hamilton felt his re-working of the illustrations in many different media had produced a visual effect analogous to Joyce\\'s verbal techniques. The Ulysses illustrations were subsequently exhibited at the Irish Museum of Modern Art (in Dublin) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (in Rotterdam). The British Museum exhibition coincided with both the 80th anniversary of the publication of Joyce\\'s novel, and Richard Hamilton\\'s 80th birthday.\\nHamilton died on 13 September 2011, at the age of 89. His work Le chef d’oeuvre inconnu – a painting in three parts, unfinished at his death, comprises a trio of large inkjet prints composed from Photoshop images to visualize the moment of crisis in Balzac’s novel The Unknown Masterpiece.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nThe first exhibition of Hamilton\\'s paintings was shown at the Hanover Gallery, London, in 1955. In 1993 Hamilton represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale and was awarded the Golden Lion. Major retrospective exhibitions have been organized by the Tate Gallery, London, 1970 and 1992, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1973, MACBA, Barcelona, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, 2003, and the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, 1974. Some of the group exhibitions Hamilton participated in include: Documenta 4, Kassel, 1968; São Paulo Art Biennial, 1989; Documenta X, Kassel 1997; Gwangju Biennale, 2004; and Shanghai Biennale, 2006. In 2010, the Serpentine Gallery presented Hamilton’s ‘Modern Moral Matters’, an exhibition focusing on his political and protest works which were shown previously in 2008 at Inverleith House, Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. For the season 2001/2002 in the Vienna State Opera Richard Hamilton designed the large scale picture (176 sqm) \"Retard en Fer – Delay in Iron\" as part of the exhibition series \"Safety Curtain\", conceived by museum in progress. Just the week prior to his death the artist was working with the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, to prepare a major museum retrospective of his oeuvre that had already been scheduled to open first at Tate Modern, London, on 13 February 2014, travelling later to Madrid where it will open on 24 June 2014.\\nIn 2011 Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane showed a joint retrospective exhibition of both Hamilton\\'s and Rita Donagh\\'s work called \"Civil Rights etc.\" That same year, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts showcased Hamilton\\'s work in Richard Hamilton: Pop Art Pioneer, 1922-2011. The National Gallery’s \"Richard Hamilton: The Late Works\" opened in 2012. A major retrospective at Tate Modern in 2014 was \"the first retrospective to encompass the full scope of Hamilton’s work, from his early exhibition designs of the 1950s to his final paintings of 2011. [The] exhibition explores his relationship to design, painting, photography and television, as well as his engagement and collaborations with other artists\".\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nThe Tate Gallery has a comprehensive collection of Hamilton\\'s work from across his career. In 1996, the Kunstmuseum Winterthur received a substantial gift of Hamilton\\'s prints, making the museum the largest repository of the artist\\'s prints in the world.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nHamilton was awarded the William and Noma Copley Foundation Award, 1960; the John Moores Painting Prize, 1969; the Talens Prize International, 1970; the Leone d’Oro for his exhibition in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, 1993; the Arnold Bode Prize at Documenta X, Kassel, 1997; and the Max Beckmann Prize for Painting of the City of Frankfurt, 2006. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 2000. He was presented with a special award by The Bogside Artists of Derry at the Royal College of Art in 2010. The School of Arts building at Oxford Brookes University is named in his honour.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nHamilton has been represented by The Robert Fraser Gallery. The Alan Cristea Gallery in London is the distributor of Hamilton\\'s prints.  His auction record is £440,000, set at Sotheby\\'s, London, in February 2006, for Fashion Plate, Cosmetic Study X (1969) For a 2014 retrospective at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, the government-owned museum insured 246 works of Hamilton for 115.6 million euros ($157 million) against loss or damage, according to an order published as law by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nLucy R.

              "  'Carolee Schneemann (October 12, 1939 – March 6, 2019) was an American visual experimental artist, known for her multi-media works on the body, narrative, sexuality and gender. She received a B.A. in poetry and philosophy from Bard College and a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Illinois. Originally a painter in the Abstract Expressionist tradition, Schneeman was uninterested in the masculine heroism of New York painters of the time and turned to performance-based work, primarily characterized by research into visual traditions, taboos, and the body of the individual in relation to social bodies. Although renowned for her work in performance and other media, Schneemann began her career as a painter, saying: \"I\\'m a painter. I\\'m still a painter and I will die a painter. Everything that I have developed has to do with extending visual principles off the canvas.\" Her works have been shown at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the London National Film Theatre, and many other venues.\\n\\nSchneemann taught at several universities, including the California Institute of the Arts, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hunter College, Rutgers University, and SUNY New Paltz. She also published widely, producing works such as Cézanne, She Was a Great Painter (1976) and More than Meat Joy: Performance Works and Selected Writings (1979). Her works have been associated with a variety of art classifications, including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, performance art, the Beat Generation, and happenings.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nCarolee Schneemann was born Carol Lee Schneiman and raised in Fox Chase, Pennsylvania. As a child, her friends described her in retrospect as \"a mad pantheist\", due to her relationship with, and respect for, nature. As a young adult, Schneemann often visited the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where she cited her earliest connections between art and sexuality to her drawings from ages four and five, which she drew on her father\\'s prescription tablets. Her family was generally supportive of her naturalness and freeness with her body. Schneemann attributed her father\\'s support to the fact that he was a rural physician who had to often deal with the body in various states of health.\\nSchneemann was awarded a full scholarship to New York\\'s Bard College. She was the first woman from her family to attend college, but her father discouraged her from an art education. While at Bard, Schneemann began to realize the differences between male and female perceptions of each other\\'s bodies while serving as a nude model for her boyfriend\\'s portraits and while painting nude self-portraits. While on leave from Bard and on a separate scholarship to Columbia University, she met musician James Tenney, who was attending The Juilliard School.\\nHer first experience with experimental film was through Stan Brakhage, Schneemann\\'s and Tenney\\'s mutual friend. After graduating from Bard in 1962, Schneemann attended the University of Illinois for her graduate degree.\\nSchneemann\\'s image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.\\n\\n\\n=== Early work ===\\nSchneemann began her art career as a painter in the late 1950s. Her painting began to adopt some of the characteristics of Neo-Dada art, as she used box structures coupled with expressionist brushwork. These constructs share the heavily textural characteristics in the work of artists such as Robert Rauschenberg. She described the atmosphere in the art community at this time as misogynistic and said that female artists of the time were not aware of their bodies. These works integrated the influence of artists such as post-impressionist painter Paul Cézanne and the issues in painting brought up by the abstract expressionists. Schneemann focused on expressiveness rather than accessibility or stylishness. But she still called herself a formalist, unlike other feminist artists who wanted to distance themselves from male-oriented art history. She is considered a \"first-generation feminist artist\", a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Rachel Rosenthal, and Judy Chicago. They were part of the feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s that developed feminist writing and art.  Schneemann became involved with the art movement of happenings when she organized A Journey through a Disrupted Landscape, inviting people to \"crawl, climb, negotiate rocks, climb, walk, go through mud\". Soon thereafter she met Allan Kaprow, the primary figure of happenings, in addition to artists Red Grooms and Jim Dine. Influenced by figures such as Simone de Beauvoir, Antonin Artaud, Maya Deren, Wilhelm Reich, and Kaprow, Schneemann found herself drawn away from painting.\\nIn 1962, Schneemann moved with Tenney from their residence in Illinois to New York City, when Tenney obtained a job with Bell Laboratories as an experimental composer. Through one of Tenney\\'s colleagues at Bell, Billy Klüver, Schneemann met figures such as Claes Oldenburg, Merce Cunningham, John Cage, and Robert Rauschenberg, which got her involved with the Judson Memorial Church\\'s art program. There, she participated in works such as Oldenburg\\'s Store Days (1962), and Robert Morris\\'s Site (1964), where she played a living version of Édouard Manet\\'s Olympia. She contributed to Oldenburg\\'s happening, filmed by Stan VanDerBeek in upstate New York, Birth of the American Flag (1965). Around this time she began to self-represent her nude body in works, feeling that it needed to be reclaimed from the status of a cultural possession. Schneemann got to personally know many New York musicians and composers in the 1960s, including George Brecht, Malcolm Goldstein, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and Steve Reich. She was also highly interested in the abstract expressionists of the time, such as Willem de Kooning. But despite her numerous connections in the art world, New York galleries and museums were not interested in Schneemann\\'s painting-constructions. Oldenburg suggested that there would have been more interest in Europe. The first support for Schneemann\\'s work came from poets such as Robert Kelly, David Antin, and Paul Blackburn, who published some of her writings.\\nProduction on Schneemann\\'s work Eye Body began in 1963. Schneemann created a \"loft environment\" filled with broken mirrors, motorized umbrellas, and rhythmic color units. To become part the art herself, she covered herself in various materials, including grease, chalk, and plastic. She created 36 \"transformative-actions\"—photographs of herself in her constructed environment by Icelandic artist Erró. Among these images is a frontal nude featuring two garden snakes crawling on Schneemann\\'s torso. This image drew particular attention both for its \"archaic eroticism\" and her visible clitoris. Schneemann said that at the time she did not know about the symbolism of the serpent in ancient cultures in figures such as the Minoan Snake Goddess and, in fact, learned of it years later. Upon its presentation to the public in 1963, art critics found the piece lewd and pornographic. Artist Valie Export cites Eye Body for the way in which Schneemann portrays \"how random fragments of her memory and personal elements of her environment are superimposed on her perception.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\nThe 1964 piece Meat Joy revolved around eight partially nude figures dancing and playing with various objects and substances including wet paint, sausage, raw fish, scraps of paper, and raw chickens. It was first performed at the Festival de la Libre Expression in Paris and later filmed and photographed as performed by her Kinetic Theater group at Judson Memorial Church. She described the piece as an \"erotic rite\" and an indulgent Dionysian \"celebration of flesh as material.\" Meat Joy is like a happening in that they both use improvisation and focus on conception rather than execution. Though her work of the 1960s was more performance-based, she continued to build assemblages such as the Joseph Cornell-influenced Native Beauties (1962–64), Music Box Music (1964), and Pharaoh\\'s Daughter (1966). Her Letter to Lou Andreas Salome (1965) expressed Schneemann\\'s philosophical interests by combining scrawlings of Nietzsche and Tolstoy with a Rauschenberg-like form. Schneeman later said of the piece: “Sensuality was always confused with pornography. The old patriarchal morality of proper behaviour and improper behaviour had no threshold for the pleasures of physical contact that were not explicitly about sex.”\\nIn 1964, Schneemann began production of her 30-minute film Fuses, finishing it in 1967. Fuses portrayed her and her then-boyfriend James Tenney (who also created the sound collages for Schneemann\\'s Viet Flakes, 1965, and Snows, 1970) having sex as recorded by a 16 mm Bolex camera, as her cat, Kitch, observed nearby. Schneemann then altered the film by staining, burning, and directly drawing on the celluloid itself, mixing the concepts of painting and collage. The segments were edited together at varying speeds and superimposed with photographs of nature, which she juxtaposed against her and Tenney\\'s bodies and sexual actions. Fuses was motivated by Schneemann\\'s desire to know whether a woman\\'s depiction of her own sexual acts was different from pornography and classical art as well as a reaction to Stan Brakhage\\'s Loving (1957), Cat\\'s Cradle (1959) and Window Water Baby Moving (1959). Schneemann herself appeared in some Brakhage films, including Cat\\'s Cradle, in which she wore an apron at Brakhage\\'s insistence. Despite her friendship with Brakhage, she later called the experience of being in Cat\\'s Cradle \"frightening,\" remarking that \"whenever I collaborated, went into a male friend\\'s film, I always thought I would be able to hold my presence, maintain an authenticity. It was soon gone, lost in their celluloid dominance—a terrifying experience—experiences of true dissolution.\" She showed Fuses to her contemporaries as she worked on it in 1965 and 1966, receiving mostly positive feedback. But many critics described it as self-indulgent, \"narcissistic exhibitionism\". There were especially strong reactions to the film\\'s cunnilingus scene. While Fuses is viewed as a \"proto-feminist\" film, Schneemann felt that feminist film historians largely neglected it. The film lacked the fetishism and objectification of the female body seen in much male-oriented pornography. Two years after its completion, it won a Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Selection prize. Pop artist Andy Warhol, with whom Schneemann was acquainted, having spent time at The Factory, drolly remarked that Schneemann should have taken the film to Hollywood. Fuses became the first film in Schneemann\\'s Autobiographical Trilogy. Though her works of the 1960s shared many of the ideas of the concurrent Fluxus artists, she remained independent of any specific movement. They formed the groundwork for the feminist art movement of the late 1960s and 1970s.\\n\\nSchneemann began work on her next film, Plumb Line, in 1968. It opens with a still shot of a man\\'s face with a plumb line in front of it before the entire image begins to burn.  Various images including Schneemann and the man appear in different quadrants of the frame while a disorienting soundtrack of music, sirens, and cat noises, among other things, plays in the background. The sound and visuals grow more intense as the film progresses, with Schneemann narrating about a period of physical and emotional illness. The film ends with Schneemann attacking a series of projected images and a repetition of its opening segment. During a showing of Plumb Line at a women\\'s film festival, it was booed for the image of the man at the beginning of the film.\\nFrom 1973 to 1976, in her ongoing piece Up to and Including Her Limits, a naked Schneemann is suspended from a tree surgeon\\'s harness attached from the ceiling above a canvas. Using the motions of her body to make marks with a crayon, the artist maps time processes as a video monitor records her movement. She manually lowers and raises the rope on which she is suspended to reach all corners of the canvas. In this work, Schneemann addresses the male-dominated art world of Abstract Expressionism and Action painting, specifically work by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Schneemann arrived at the museum when it opened, with the cleaners, guards, secretaries, maintenance crew, and remained until it closed. Through this practice she explored the political and personal implications of the museum space by enabling the place of art creation and art presentation to become one. Schneemann intended to do away with performance, a fixed audience, rehearsals, improvisation, sequences, conscious intention, technical cues, and a central metaphor or theme in order to explore what was left.:\\u200a165\\u200a In 1984, she completed the final video, a compilation of video footage from six performances: the Berkeley Museum, 1974; London Filmmaker\\'s Cooperative, 1974; Artists Space, NY, 1974; Anthology Film Archives, NY, 1974; The Kitchen, NY, 1976; and the Studio Galerie, Berlin, 1976.\\nIn 1975, Schneemann performed Interior Scroll in East Hampton, New York, and at the Telluride Film Festiva. This was a notable Fluxus-influenced piece featuring her use of text and body. In her performance, Schneemann entered wrapped in a sheet, under which she wore an apron. She disrobed and then got on a table where she outlined her body with mud. Several times, she would take \"action poses\", similar to those in figure drawing classes. Concurrently, she read from her book Cézanne, She Was a Great Painter. Then she dropped the book and slowly extracted from her vagina a scroll from which she read. Schneeman\\'s speech described a parody version of an encounter where she received criticism on her films for their \"persistence of feelings\" and \"personal clutter\". Art Historian David Hopkins suggests that this performance was a comment on \"internalized criticism\" and possibly \"feminist interest\" in female writing.\\nSchneemann\\'s feminist scroll speech, according to performance theorist Jeanie Forte, made it seem as if Schneemann\\'s \"vagina itself is reporting [...] sexism\". Art critic Robert C. Morgan wrote that it is necessary to acknowledge the period during which Interior Scroll was produced in order to understand it. He argues that by placing the source of artistic creativity at the female genitals, Schneemann changes the masculine overtones of minimalist art and conceptual art into a feminist exploration of her body. Interior Scroll, along with Judy Chicago\\'s Dinner Party, helped pioneer many of the ideas later popularized by the off-broadway show The Vagina Monologues. In 1978, Schneemann finished the last film, Kitch\\'s Last Meal, in what was later called her \"Autobiographical Trilogy\".\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s–2010s ===\\n\\nSchneemann said that in the 1980s her work was sometimes considered by various feminist groups to be an insufficient response to many feminist issues of the time. Her 1994 piece Mortal Coils commemorated 15 friends and colleagues who had died over two years, including Hannah Wilke, John Cage, and Charlotte Moorman. The piece consisted of rotating mechanisms from which hung coiled ropes while slides of the commemorated artists were shown on the walls.\\nFrom 1981 to 1988, Schneemann\\'s piece Infinity Kisses was displayed at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The wall installation, consisting of 140 self-shot images, depicted Schneemann kissing her cat at various angles.\\nIn December 2001, she unveiled Terminal Velocity, which consisted of a group of photographs of people falling to their deaths from the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 attacks. In this and another of Schneemann\\'s works that used the same images, Dark Pond, Schneemann sought to \"personalize\" the attacks\\' victims by digitally enhancing and enlarging the figures in the images, isolating them from their surroundings.\\nSchneemann continued to produce art later in life, including the 2007 installation Devour, which featured videos of recent wars contrasted with everyday images of United States daily life on dual screens.\\nShe was interviewed for the 2010 film !Women Art Revolution.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s−2020s ===\\nIn 2020, Schneemann\\'s work was included in a major group show at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida. My Body, My Rules investigated the artistic practices of 23 female-identified artists in the 21st century, including Louise Bourgeois, Ida Applebroog, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Ana Mendieta, Wanguechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas, and Francesca Woodman.\\n\\n\\n== Themes ==\\nOne of Schneemann\\'s work\\'s primary focuses was the separation between eroticism and the politics of gender. Her cat Kitch, which was featured in works such as Fuses (1967) and Kitch\\'s Last Meal (1978), was a major figure in her work for almost 20 years. She used Kitch as an \"objective\" observer to her and Tenney\\'s sexual activities, saying that she was unaffected by human mores. One of her later cats, Vesper, was featured in the photographic series Infinity Kisses (1986).  In a wall-size collection of 140 photos, Schneemann documented her daily kisses with Vesper and \"the artist at life\". With numerous works foregrounding the centrality of feline companions in Schneemann\\'s life, scholars now locate her work as significant for new accounts of human-animal relations.\\nShe listed as an aesthetic influence on herself and James Tenney the poet Charles Olson, especially the collage Maximus at Gloucester but also in general, \"in relationship to his concern for deep imagery, sustained metaphor, and also that he had been researching Tenney’s ancestors\", despite his occasional sexist comments.\\n\\n\\n=== Painting ===\\nSchneemann considered her photographic and body pieces based in painting despite appearing otherwise on the surface.  She called herself a \"painter who has left the canvas to activate actual space and lived time.\" She cited her studies with painter Paul Brach as teaching her to \"understand the stroke as an event in time\" and to think of her performers as \"colors in three dimensions.\" Schneemann took the ideas in her figurative abstract paintings of the 1950s, where she cut and destroyed layers of paint from their surfaces, and transferred them to her photographic work Eye Body. Art history professor Kristine Stiles asserts that Schneemann\\'s entire oeuvre is devoted to exploring the concepts of figure-ground, relationality (both through use of her body), and similitude (through the use of cats and trees). Stiles says that the issues of sex and politics in Schneemann\\'s work merely dictate how the art is shaped, rather than the formal concepts found behind it. For example, Schneemann relates the colors and movement featured in Fuses to brush strokes in painting. Her 1976 piece Up to and Including Her Limits, too, invokes the gestural brush strokes of the abstract expressionists with Scheemann swinging from ropes and scribbling with crayons onto a variety of surfaces.\\n\\n\\n== Feminism and the body ==\\nSchneemann acknowledged that she was often called a feminist icon and that she is an influential figure to female artists, but noted that she reached out to male artists as well. Though she was noted for being a feminist figure, her works explore issues in art and rely heavily on her broad knowledge of art history. Though works such as Eye Body were meant to explore the processes of painting and assemblage, rather than address feminist topics, they still possess a strong female presence.\\nIn Schneemann\\'s earlier work, she is seen as addressing issues of patriarchal hierarchies in the 1950s American gallery space. She addressed these issues through various performance pieces that sought to create agency for the female body as both sensual and sexual, while simultaneously breaking gallery space taboos against nude performance.\\nUnlike much other feminist art, Schneemann\\'s revolves around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann\\'s work resists the \"political correctness\" of some branches of feminism as well as ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis. He also asserts that Schneemann\\'s work is difficult to classify and analyze because it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. In her 1976 book Cézanne, She Was A Great Painter, Schneemann wrote that she used nudity to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that \"the life of the body is more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit.\" She also wrote, \"In some sense I made a gift of my body to other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves.\" According to Kristine Stiles, Schneemann read several books exploring the body\\'s relationship with \"sexuality, culture, and freedom\", such as The Theater and Its Double by Antonin Artaud, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, and The Sexual Revolution by Wilhelm Reich. These may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wish to gain equality. She preferred her term \"art istorical\" (without the h), so as to reject the \"his\" in history.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\nMuch of Schneemann\\'s work was performance-based, so photographs, video documentation, sketches, and artist\\'s notes are often used to examine her work. It was not until the 1990s that her work began to be recognized as a central part of the contemporary feminist art canon. The first prominent exhibition of her work was the modest 1996 retrospective Up To and Including Her Limits, named for her 1973 work of the same title. It was held at New York City\\'s New Museum of Contemporary Art and organized by senior curator Dan Cameron.  Previously, these works were dismissed as narcissism or otherwise overly sexualized forms of expression.\\nCritic Jan Avgikos wrote in 1997, \"Prior to Schneemann, the female body in art was mute and functioned almost exclusively as a mirror of masculine desire.\" Critics have also noted that the reaction to Schneemann\\'s work has changed since its original performance. Nancy Princenthal notes that modern viewers of Meat Joy are still squeamish about it; however, now the reaction is also due to the biting of raw chicken or to the men hauling women over their shoulders.\\nSchneemann\\'s work from the late 1950s continues to influence later artists such as Matthew Barney and others, especially women artists. Carolee\\'s Magazine, printed by the Artist\\'s Institute in New York City, highlights Schneemann\\'s visual legacy through side-by-side comparisons with newer artists.

              "  'Edward Joseph Ruscha IV (, roo-SHAY; born December 16, 1937) is an American artist associated with the pop art movement. He has worked in the media of painting, printmaking, drawing, photography, and film. He is also noted for creating several artist\\'s books. Ruscha lives and works in Culver City, California.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nRuscha was born into a Roman Catholic family in Omaha, Nebraska, with an older sister, Shelby, and a younger brother, Paul. Edward Ruscha, Sr. was an auditor for Hartford Insurance Company. Ruscha\\'s mother was supportive of her son\\'s early signs of artistic skill and interests. Young Ruscha was attracted to cartooning and would sustain this interest throughout his adolescent years. Though born in Nebraska, Ruscha lived some 15 years in Oklahoma City before moving to Los Angeles in 1956 where he studied at the Chouinard Art Institute (now known as the California Institute of the Arts) under Robert Irwin and Emerson Woelffer from 1956 through 1960. While at Chouinard, Ruscha edited and produced the journal Orb (1959–60) together with Joe Goode, Emerson Woelffer, Stephan von Huene, Jerry McMillan, and others. As a result, Orb became one of the U.S.\\' first recorded alternative newspapers.\\nIn 1961, Ruscha spent seven months traveling through Europe. After graduation, Ruscha took a job as a layout artist for the Carson-Roberts advertising agency in Los Angeles.\\nBy the early 1960s he was well known for his paintings, collages, and photographs, and for his association with the Ferus Gallery group, which also included artists Robert Irwin, John Altoon, John McCracken, Larry Bell, Ken Price, and Edward Kienholz. He worked as layout designer for Artforum magazine under the pseudonym “Eddie Russia” from 1965 to 1969 and taught at UCLA as a visiting professor for printing and drawing in 1969. He is also a lifelong friend of guitarist Mason Williams.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nRuscha achieved recognition for paintings incorporating words and phrases and for his many photographic books, all influenced by the deadpan irreverence of the Pop Art movement. His textual, flat paintings have been linked with both the Pop Art movement and the beat generation.\\n\\n\\n=== Early influences ===\\nWhile in school in 1957, Ruscha chanced upon then unknown Jasper Johns’ Target with Four Faces in the magazine Print and was greatly moved. Ruscha has credited this artist\\'s work as a source of inspiration for his change of interest from graphic arts to painting. He was also impacted by John McLaughlin\\'s paintings, the work of H.C. Westermann, Arthur Dove’s 1925 painting Goin’ Fishin’, Alvin Lustig\\'s cover illustrations for New Directions Press, and much of Marcel Duchamp’s work. In a 1961 tour of Europe, Ruscha came upon more works by Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, R. A. Bertelli’s Head of Mussolini, and Ophelia by Sir John Everett Millais. Some critics are quick to see the influence of Edward Hopper\\'s Gas (1940) in Ruscha\\'s 1963 oil painting, Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas. In any case, \"Art has to be something that makes you scratch your head,\" Ruscha said.\\n\\n\\n=== Southern California ===\\n\\nAlthough Ruscha denies this in interviews, the vernacular of Los Angeles and Southern California landscapes contributes to the themes and styles central to much of Ruscha\\'s paintings, drawings, and books. Examples of this include the publication Every Building on the Sunset Strip (1966), a book of continuous photographs of a two and one half mile stretch of the 24 mile boulevard. In 1973, following the model of Every Building on the Sunset Strip, he photographed the entire length of Hollywood Boulevard with a motorized camera. Also, paintings like Standard Station (1966), Large Trademark (1962), and Hollywood (1982) exemplify Ruscha\\'s kinship with the Southern California visual language. Two of these paintings, Standard and Large Trademark were emulated out of car parts in 2008 by Brazilian photographer Vik Muniz as a commentary on Los Angeles and its car culture.\\nHis work is also strongly influenced by the Hollywood film industry: the mountain in his Mountain Series is a play on the Paramount Pictures logo; Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights (1962) depicts the 20th Century Fox logo, while the dimensions of this work are reminiscent of a movie screen; in his painting The End (1991) these two words, which comprised the final shot in all black-and-white films, are surrounded by scratches and streaks reminiscent of damaged celluloid. Also, the proportions of the Hollywood print seems to mimic the Cinemascope screen (however, to make the word \"Hollywood\", Ruscha transposed the letters of the sign from their actual location on the slope of the Santa Monica Mountains to the crest of the ridge).\\nRuscha completed Large Trademark with Eight Spotlights in 1961, one year after graduating from college. Among his first paintings (SU (1958–1960), Sweetwater (1959)) this is the most widely known, and exemplifies Ruscha\\'s interests in popular culture, word depictions, and commercial graphics that would continue to inform his work throughout his career. Large Trademark was quickly followed by Standard Station (1963) and Wonder Bread (1962). In Norm’s, La Cienega, on Fire (1964), Burning Gas Station (1965–66), and Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Fire (1965–68), Ruscha brought flames into play. In 1966, Ruscha reproduced Standard Station in a silkscreen print using a split-fountain printing technique, introducing a gradation of tone in the background of the print, with variations following in 1969 (Mocha Standard, Cheese Mold Standard with Olive, and Double Standard).\\nIn 1985, Ruscha begins a series of \"City Lights\" paintings, where grids of bright spots on dark grounds suggest aerial views of the city at night. More recently, his \"Metro Plots\" series chart the various routes that transverse the city of Los Angeles by rendering schematized street maps and blow-ups of its neighborhood sections, such as in Alvarado to Doheny (1998). The paintings are grey and vary in their degrees of light and dark, therefore appearing as they were done by pencil in the stippling technique. A 2003 portfolio of prints called Los Francisco San Angeles shows street intersections from San Francisco and LA juxtaposed one over the other.\\n\\n\\n=== Word paintings ===\\nAs with Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, his East Coast counterparts, Ruscha\\'s artistic training was rooted in commercial art. His interest in words and typography ultimately provided the primary subject of his paintings, prints and photographs. The very first of Ruscha\\'s word paintings were created as oil paintings on paper in Paris in 1961. He began to isolate monosyllables — ACE, BOSS, HONK, OOF — without additional imagery against solid backgrounds.\\nSince 1964, Ruscha has been experimenting regularly with painting and drawing words and phrases, often oddly comic and satirical sayings alluding to popular culture and life in LA. When asked where he got his inspiration for his paintings, Ruscha responded, “Well, they just occur to me; sometimes people say them and I write down and then I paint them. Sometimes I use a dictionary.” From 1966 to 1969, Ruscha painted his “liquid word” paintings: Words such as Adios (1967), Steel (1967–9) and Desire (1969) were written as if with liquid spilled, dribbled or sprayed over a flat monochromatic surface. His gunpowder and graphite drawings (made during a period of self-imposed exile from painting from 1967 to 1970) feature single words depicted in a trompe l’oeil technique, as if the words are formed from ribbons of curling paper. Experimenting with humorous sounds and rhyming word plays, Ruscha made a portfolio of seven mixed-media lithographs with the rhyming words, News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues, News (1970).\\nIn the 1970s, Ruscha, with Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer, among others, began using entire phrases in their works, thereby making it a distinctive characteristic of the post-Pop Art generation. During the mid-1970s, he made a series of drawings in pastel using pithy phrases against a field of color. He also congreagated with artists including George Condo. In the early 1980s he produced a series of paintings of words over sunsets, night skies and wheat fields. In the photo-realist painting Brave Men Run In My Family (1988), part of the artist\\'s \"Dysfuntional Family\" series, Ruscha runs the text over the silhouetted image of a great, listing tall ship; the piece was a collaboration with fellow Los Angeles artist Nancy Reese (she did the painting, he the lettering). In a series of insidious small abstract paintings from 1994 to 1995, words forming threats are rendered as blank widths of contrasting color like Morse code. Later, words appeared on a photorealist mountain-range series which Ruscha started producing in 1998. For these acrylic-on-canvas works, Ruscha pulled his mountain images either from photographs, commercial logos, or from his imagination.\\nFrom 1980, Ruscha started using an all-caps typeface of his own invention named ”Boy Scout Utility Modern” in which curved letter forms are squared-off (as in the Hollywood Sign) This simple font is radically different from the style he used in works such as Honk (1962). Beginning in the mid-1980s, in many of his paintings black or white ‘blanks’ or ‘censor strips’ are included, to suggest where the ‘missing’ words would have been placed. The ‘blanks’ would also feature in his series of Silhouette, Cityscapes or ‘censored’ word works, often made in bleach on canvas, rayon or linen.\\n\\n\\n=== Surrealism ===\\nPaintings like Angry Because It’s Plaster, Not Milk (1965) and Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish (1965) are exemplary works from Ruscha\\'s group of paintings from the mid-1960s that take the strict idea of literal representation into the realm of the absurd. This body of work is characterized by what the artist termed “bouncing objects, floating things,” such as a radically oversized red bird and glass hovering in front of a simple background in the work and have a strong affinity to Surrealism, a recurring theme in the artist\\'s career.  The fish plays a prominent role throughout the series and appears in nearly half of the paintings. Another frequent element is Ruscha\\'s continuous depiction of a graphite pencil – broken, splintered, melted, transformed.\\n\\n\\n=== Odd media ===\\n\\nIn his drawings, prints, and paintings throughout the 1970s, Ruscha experimented with a range of materials including gunpowder, vinyl, blood, red wine, fruit and vegetable juices, axle grease, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, bolognese sauce, cherry pie, coffee, caviar, daffodils, tulips, raw eggs and grass stains. Stains, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in edible substances such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like A Blvd. Called Sunset (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colorings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio Insects (1972) consists of six screen prints – three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine\\'s title in a salad of squashed foods. Ruscha\\'s Fruit Metrecal Hollywood (1971) is an example of the artist\\'s use of unusual materials, this silkscreen of the \"Hollywood\" sign is rendered in apricot and grape jam and the diet drink Metrecal on paper.\\n\\n\\n=== Motifs in light ===\\nNotably different from many of Ruscha\\'s works of the same period, most obviously in its exclusion of text, his series of Miracle pastel drawings from in the mid-1970s show bright beams of light burst forth from skies with dark clouds. An overall glow is created by the black pastel not being completely opaque, allowing the paper to shine through. In the 1980s, a more subtle motif began to appear, again in a series of drawings, some incorporating dried vegetable pigments: a mysterious patch of light cast by an unseen window that serves as background for phrases such as WONDER SICKNESS (1984) and 99% DEVIL, 1% ANGEL (1983). By the 1990s, Ruscha was creating larger paintings of light projected into empty rooms, some with ironic titles such as An Exhibition of Gasoline Powered Engines (1993).\\n\\n\\n=== Commissioned works ===\\nRuscha\\'s first major public commissions include a monumental mural at the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego (1966) and a seventy-panel, 360-degree work for the Great Hall of Denver Public Library in Colorado (1995). Created as part of a public-art commission, The Back of Hollywood (1976–77) was made from a large sheet of sateen on a billboard and situated opposite the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, designed to be read in the rear-view mirror of a moving car. In 1985 Ruscha was commissioned to design a series of fifty murals, WORDS WITHOUT THOUGHTS NEVER TO HEAVEN GO (a quotation from Hamlet), for the rotunda of Miami–Dade Public Library (now the Miami Art Museum) in Florida, designed by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee.\\nIn 1989, Ruscha decorated a pool for his brother Paul at his house in Studio City, Los Angeles, with a supersized luggage label: on a black tiled background are the words Name, Address and Phone, complete with dotted lines.\\nIn 1998, Ruscha was commissioned to produce a nearly thirty-foot high vertical painting entitled PICTURE WITHOUT WORDS, for the lobby of the Harold M. Williams Auditorium of the Getty Center. He produced another site-specific piece, three 13-by-23-foot panels proclaiming Words In Their Best Order, for the offices of Gannett Company publishers in Tysons Corner, Virginia, in 2002. The artist was later asked by the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum to create two large-scale paintings that flank his A Particular Kind of Heaven (1983), which is in the museum\\'s collection, to form a spectacular, monumental triptych. For his first public commission in New York in 2014, Ruscha created the hand-painted mural Honey, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today for a temporary installation at the High Line.\\nIn 2008, Ruscha was among four text-based artists that were invited by the Whitechapel Gallery to write scripts to be performed by leading actors; Ruscha\\'s contribution was Public Notice (2007). To celebrate the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA)\\'s 75th anniversary, Ruscha was one of the artists invited to collaborate with the museum on a limited-edition of artist-designed T-shirts. Ruscha is regularly commissioned with works for private persons, among them James Frey (Public Stoning, 2007), Lauren Hutton (Boy Meets Girl, 1987), and Stella McCartney (Stella, 2001). In 1987, collector Frederick Weisman had Ruscha paint the exterior of his private plane, a Lockheed JetStar. The summer 2012 campaign of L.A.-based fashion label Band of Outsiders featured Polaroid shots of Ruscha. In 2020, Ruscha produced the cover art and typography of Paul McCartney\\'s album McCartney III. In 2022, he teamed up with (RED) and Gagosian Gallery to create a limited-edition silk twill scarf—featuring his drawing Science Is Truth Found (1986)—to help provide more equitable access to COVID-19 relief. In 2023 he created the cover art for the Beatles single \"Now and Then.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\n\\nBetween 1962 and 1978, Ruscha produced sixteen small artist\\'s books:\\n\\nTwentysix Gasoline Stations, 1963\\nVarious Small Fires, 1964\\nSome Los Angeles Apartments, 1965\\nEvery Building on the Sunset Strip, 1966\\nThirtyfour Parking Lots, 1967\\nRoyal Road Test, 1967 (with Mason Williams and Patrick Blackwell)\\nBusiness Cards, 1968 (with Billy Al Bengston)\\nNine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass, 1968\\nCrackers, 1969 (with Mason Williams)\\nReal Estate Opportunities, 1970\\nBabycakes with Weights, 1970\\nA Few Palm Trees, 1971\\nRecords, 1971\\nDutch Details, 1971\\nColored People, 1972\\nHard Light, 1978 (with Lawrence Weiner)\\nLater book projects include:\\n\\nCountry Cityscapes, 2001\\nME and THE, 2002\\nEd Ruscha and Photography, 2004 (with Sylvia Wolf)\\nOH / NO, 2008\\nDirty Baby, 2010 (with Nels Cline and David Breskin)\\nIn 1968, Ruscha created the cover design for the catalogue accompanying a Billy Al Bengston exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. For the “Documenta 5\" catalogue in 1972, he designed an orange vinyl cover, featuring a “5” made up of scurrying black ants. In 1978, he designed the catalogue \"Stella Since 1970\" for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Leave Any Information at the Signal, a volume of Ruscha\\'s writings, was published by MIT Press in 2002. In 2010, Gagosian Gallery and Steidl published Ruscha\\'s version of Jack Kerouac\\'s novel On the Road in an edition of 350.\\nRuscha\\'s artist books have proved to be deeply influential, beginning with Bruce Nauman’s Burning Small Fires (1968), for which Nauman burned Ruscha\\'s Various Small Fires and Milk (1964) and photographed the process. More than forty years later, photographer Charles Johnstone relocated Ruscha\\'s Twentysix Gasoline Stations in Cuba, producing the portfolio Twentysix Havana Gasoline Stations (2008). A recent homage is One Swimming Pool (2013) by Dutch artist Elisabeth Tonnard, who re-photographed one of the photographs from Ruscha\\'s Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass (1968) and enlarged it to the size of a small swimming pool, consisting of 3164 pages the same size as the pages in Ruscha\\'s original book. The pages of this ‘pool on a shelf’ can be detached to create the life-size installation.\\n\\n\\n=== Photography ===\\nPhotography has played a crucial role throughout Ruscha\\'s career, beginning with images he made during a trip to Europe with his mother and brother in 1961, and most memorably as the imagery for more than a dozen books that present precisely what their titles describe. His photographs are straightforward, even deadpan, in their depiction of subjects that are not generally thought of as having aesthetic qualities. His \"Products\" pictures, for example, feature boxes of Sunmaid raisins and Oxydol detergent and a can of Sherwin Williams turpentine in relatively formal still lifes. Mostly devoid of human presence, these photographs emphasize the essential form of the structure and its placement within the built environment. Ruscha\\'s photographic editions are most often based on his conceptual art-books of same or similar name. Ruscha re-worked the negatives of six of the images from his book Every Building on Sunset Strip. The artist then cut and painted directly on the negatives, resulting in photographs that have the appearance of a faded black-and-white film. The Tropical Fish series (1974–75) represents the first instance where the photographic image has been directly used in his graphic work, where Ruscha had Gemini G.E.L.\\'s house photographer Malcolm Lubliner make photographs of a range of common domestic objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Films and documentaries ===\\nIn the 1970s, Ruscha also made a series of largely unknown short movies, such as Premium (1971) and Miracle (1975). With the assistance of a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship, Ruscha arranged in Premium a scenario which he first projected in his photo-book Crackers from 1969 and subsequently transformed into a film which features Larry Bell, Leon Bing, Rudi Gernreich, and Tommy Smothers. Miracle contains the essence of the artist\\'s same-named painting, inasmuch as the story is told of a strange day in the life of an auto mechanic, who is magically transformed as he rebuilds the carburetor on a 1965 Ford Mustang. The movie features Jim Ganzer and  Michelle Phillips. In 1984, he accepted a small role in the film Choose Me directed by his friend Alan Rudolph, and in 2010, he starred in Doug Aitken\\'s film Sleepwalkers. Artist Tom Sachs\\' 2018 short film Paradox Bullets stars Ruscha in the role of a hiker lost in the desert and guided only by the voice of Werner Herzog.\\nRuscha was featured in Michael Blackwood\\'s film documentary American Art in the Sixties. He appeared in L.A. Suggested by the Art of Edward Ruscha, a 1981 documentary by Gary Conklin shot at the artist\\'s studio and desert home. Interviews with Ruscha are included in the documentaries Dennis Hopper: The Decisive Moments (2002), Sketches of Frank Gehry (2005), The Cool School (2008), Iconoclasts (2008), and How to Make a Book with Steidl (2010), among others.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Birth of \"Pop Art\" ===\\nIn 1962 Ruscha\\'s work was included, along with Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Dowd, Phillip Hefferton, Joe Goode, Jim Dine, and Wayne Thiebaud, in the historically important and ground-breaking \"New Painting of Common Objects,\" curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. This exhibition is historically considered one of the first \"Pop Art\" exhibitions in America.\\nRuscha had his first solo exhibition in 1963 at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1966, Ruscha was included in \"Los Angeles Now\" at the Robert Fraser Gallery in London, his first European exhibition. In 1968, he had his first European solo show in Cologne, Germany, at Galerie Rudolf Zwirner. Ruscha joined the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1970 and had his first solo exhibition there in 1973.\\n\\n\\n=== Retrospectives ===\\nIn 1970 Ruscha represented the United States at the Venice Biennale as part of a survey of American printmaking with an on-site workshop. He constructed Chocolate Room, a visual and sensory experience where the visitor saw 360 pieces of paper permeated with chocolate and hung like shingles on the gallery walls. The pavilion in Venice smelled like a chocolate factory. For the Venice Biennale in 1976, Ruscha created an installation entitled Vanishing Cream, consisting of letters written in Vaseline petroleum jelly on a black wall. Ruscha was the United States representative at the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005, showing the site- and occasion-specific a painting cycle Course of Empire. He was interviewed about the pavilion and its curation by Linda Norden and Donna De Salvo in Sarah Thornton\\'s Seven Days in the Art World.\\nHe has been the subject of numerous museum retrospectives, beginning in 1983 with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (traveling to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Vancouver Art Gallery, the San Antonio Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1989, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 2000, and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in 2001. In 2004, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney mounted a selection of the artist\\'s photographs, paintings, books and drawings that traveled to the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo, Rome and to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.\\nIn 1998, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles organized a retrospective solely devoted to Ruscha\\'s works on paper. In 2004, The Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited a second Ruscha drawing retrospective, which traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and then to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nIn 1999, the Walker Art Center mounted Edward Ruscha: Editions 1959-1999, a major retrospective of the artist\\'s prints, books, and graphic works, which number well over 300. The show travelled to the LACMA in 2000. Ruscha coauthored the catalogue raisonné with Walker curator Siri Engberg. In July 2012, Reading Ed Ruscha opened at the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria.\\nIn 2006, an exhibition of Ruscha\\'s photographs was organized for the Jeu de Paume in Paris, the Kunsthaus Zürich, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.\\nIn October 2009, London\\'s Hayward Gallery featured the first retrospective to focus exclusively on Ruscha\\'s canvases. Entitled \"Ed Ruscha: Fifty Years of Painting,\" the exhibition sheds light on his influences, such as comics, graphic design, and hitchhiking. The exhibition travelled to Haus der Kunst, Munich, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm. “Ed Ruscha: Road Tested,” opened at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas in January 2011. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles prepared an exhibition with Ruscha inspired by Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, which opened in mid-2011 (traveled to Denver Art Museum, Colorado in December 2011 and Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, Florida in May 2012).\\nIn 2016, there was a large 99 piece exhibit of Ruscha\\'s paintings and prints in San Francisco\\'s M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. The exhibit, \"Ed Ruscha and the Great American West,\" focuses primarily on how the artist drew inspiration from the American West. In 1956, Ruscha drove from his home in Oklahoma to Los Angeles where he hoped to attend art school. While driving in a 1950 Ford sedan, the 18 year old artist drew inspiration from dilapidated gas stations, billboards, and telephone poles cross the great expanse of the land. This inspiration from the American West across Route 66 stuck with Ruscha his whole life. The artists paintings of the West reflect both symbolic and ironic renditions of how we imagine the West.\\nIn 2018, The Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas presented \"Ed Ruscha: Archaeology and Romance,\" featuring more than 150 objects drawn from the Ransom Center\\'s Edward Ruscha Papers and Art Collection.\\nFrom September 2023 to January 2024, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City exhibited the retrospective “ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN” featuring over 200 works across mediums, including The Chocolate Room. \\n\\n\\n=== Curating ===\\nIn 2003, Ed Ruscha curated \"Emerson Woelffer: A Solo Flight\", a survey of the work of the late Los Angeles-based Abstract Expressionist, for the inaugural exhibition of the Gallery at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater). In 2012, Ruscha was invited to curate “The Ancients Stole All Our Great Ideas” at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, the first exhibition in a series for which internationally renowned artists were invited to work with the national art and natural history collections.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nIn 2000, the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, a branch of Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, acquired Ruscha\\'s complete graphic archive of 325 prints and 800 working proofs. The museum bought the archive and negotiated for impressions of future prints for $10 million, with funds provided by San Francisco philanthropist Phyllis Wattis. Another major collection of Ruscha\\'s prints was compiled by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2003, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles acquired the Chocolate Room, then worth about $1.5 million. In 2004, the Whitney Museum acquired more than 300 photographs through a purchase and gift from the artist, making it the principal repository of Ruscha\\'s photographic oevre. The gift, purchased from Larry Gagosian, includes vintage photographs that Ruscha took on a seven-month European tour in 1961. In 2005, Leonard A. Lauder purchased The Old Tool & Die Building (2004) and The Old Trade School Building (2005) for the Whitney, both of which were part of \"The Course of Empire: Paintings by Ed Ruscha\" at the Venice Biennale. Ruscha is represented by 33 of his works in the permanent collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art owns 25 Ruscha paintings, works on paper, and photographs; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden has 21 Ruschas in its permanent collection; and the Art Institute of Chicago has more than 40 works by the artist in their collection. Ruscha also has small collections of books and lithographs in the Utah Museum of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City, Utah and in Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art in Montsoreau, France.\\nRuscha\\'s private collectors have in the past included Leonardo DiCaprio, Owen Wilson and Jay-Z.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2001: Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters as a member of the Department of Art, after having previously received its Hassam, Speicher, Betts, and Symons Purchase Fund Award in 1992\\'.\\n2001: Honorary doctorate degree from California College of the Arts\\n2002: amfAR’s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS\\n2004: Honorary Royal Academician of London’s Royal Academy of Arts\\n2006: The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh)\\n2008: Aspen Award for Art\\n2008: Honorary doctorate degree from Rhode Island School of Design\\n2009: National Arts Award for Artistic Excellence\\n2009: Honorary doctorate degree from San Francisco Art Institute\\n2013: Named in Time\\'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world\\n2013: Honored on the occasion of the Whitney Museum of American Art\\'s annual gala event\\n2019: J.

The muralist Kent Twitchell painted an 11,000-square-foot mural in Downtown Los Angeles to honor Ruscha entitled the Ed Ruscha Monument between 1978 and 1987. The mural was preserved until 2006 when it was illegally painted over. The band Talking Heads Ruscha\\'s eponymous 1974 painting for their \"Sand in the Vaseline\" compilation album. The band Various Cruelties, based around Liam O\\'Donnell, was named after Ruscha\\'s painting of the same name of 1974.\\nBetween 2006 and 2012, Ruscha served on the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) in Los Angeles where he had previously been included in eight special exhibits. In 2012, he was the honoree of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s Art + Film gala; in a speech, the museums\\'s director Michal Govan paid tribute to the artist, quoting the novelist J. G. Ballard: “Ed Ruscha has the coolest gaze in American art.” Ruscha was elected to a three-year term on the board of trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2013. From 2015 until 2019, Ruscha also served on the board of Desert X; he resigned over the board\\'s decision to collaborate on an exhibition in Saudi Arabia.\\nIn 2009, Ruscha\\'s I Think I’ll... (1983) from the collection of the National Gallery was installed at the White House. In 2010, during British prime minister David Cameron\\'s first visit to Washington, President Barack Obama presented him with a signed two-color lithograph by Ruscha, Column With Speed Lines (2003), chosen for its red, white and blue colors. Obama gave Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott a similar lithograph during his visit to the White House in 2014. Ruscha\\'s Screaming in Spanish (2013) was installed in the entry hall of the residence of the United States Ambassador to Spain in Madrid.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nAs early as 2002, the oil on canvas word painting Talk About Space (1963), a takeoff on the American billboard in which a single word is the subject, was expected to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million from a private European collection. It was eventually sold for $3.5 million at Christie\\'s in New York, a record for the artist. In 2008, Eli Broad acquired Ruscha\\'s \"liquid word\" painting Desire (1969) for $2.4 million at Sotheby\\'s, which back then was 40 percent under the $4 million low estimate. A navy blue canvas with the word Smash in yellow, which Ruscha painted in 1963, was purchased by Larry Gagosian for $30.4 million at a 2014 Christie\\'s auction in New York. His word painting Hurting the Word Radio #2 (1964) sold by L.A. collectors Joan and Jack Quinn to an anonymous bidder at Christie\\'s for a record-shattering $52.5 million with fees in 2019.\\nAngry Because It’s Plaster, Not Milk from 1965, which had been shown at Ferus Gallery that year, was sold by Halsey Minor to Gagosian Gallery for $3.2 million at Phillips de Pury & Company, New York, in 2010. From the same series, Strange Catch for a Fresh Water Fish (1965) made $4.1 million at Christie\\'s New York in 2011.\\nRuscha\\'s classic prints, published as multiples, command up to $40,000 apiece.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nRuscha is married to the former Danica Knego (known as Danna). They met in 1965, wed in 1967, separated in 1972, filed for divorce in 1976, divorced in 1978, and remarried in 1987. The couple has two children, Edward \"Eddie\" Ruscha Jr., a son, and Sonny Bjornson, a daughter. In the late seventies, Ruscha bought land about ten miles from Pioneertown, California; he later built a house there.\\nDuring the time he and Danna were apart, Ruscha dated actresses Candy Clark, Samantha Eggar, Diane Keaton, Lauren Hutton, and Michelle Phillips.\\nAccording to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Ruscha donated $12,500 to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton in September 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nIn 2011, the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Getty Research Institute acquired over seventy photographs by Ruscha as well as his \"Streets of Los Angeles\" archive, including thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera. A portion of the material will go to the Getty as a promised gift from the artist. The \"Streets of Los Angeles\" archive acquired by the Getty Research Institute begins with the photographic and production material for Ruscha\\'s landmark 1966 book Every Building on the Sunset Strip, and includes the original camera-ready three-panel maquette used for the publication. This ongoing project subsequently evolved into a vast photographic archive that spans over four decades and documents many major Los Angeles thoroughfares, including Santa Monica Boulevard, Melrose Avenue, and Pacific Coast Highway, shot in 1974 and 1975, and more than 25 other Los Angeles streets that Ruscha photographed since 2007. In total, the archive comprises thousands of negatives, hundreds of photographic contact sheets, and related documents and ephemera.\\nIn 2013, the Harry Ransom Center acquired a Ruscha archive comprising five personal journals filled with preliminary sketches and notes; materials related to the making of his artist\\'s book On The Road (2010); notes, photographs, correspondence and contact sheets relating to the creation and publication of his many other artist\\'s books; and materials relating to his short films Miracle (1975) and Premium (1971); his portfolios; and several art commissions. Ruscha himself donated a substantial portion of the archive to the Ransom Center.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Sources ==\\nJohn Coplans, \"New Paintings of Common Objects\", Artforum, November, 1962.

              "  'Patrick Brill  (born 1963), better known by his pseudonym Bob and Roberta Smith, is a British contemporary artist, writer, author, musician, art education advocate, and keynote speaker. He is known for his \"slogan\" art, is an associate professor at the School of Art, Architecture and Design at London Metropolitan University and has curated public art projects such as Art U Need. He was curator for the 2006 Peace Camp and created the 2013 Art Party to promote contemporary art and advocacy. His works have been exhibited and are in collections in Europe and the United States.  Brill co-founded The Ken Ardley Playboys and hosts the Make Your Own Damn Music radio show.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nPatrick Brill is the son of landscape painter Frederick Brill (1920–1984), head of the Chelsea Art School from 1965 to 1979, and his wife, the artist Deirdre Borlase. He has a sister who is a psychiatric nurse, Roberta. He graduated from the University of Reading and received a scholarship during that time to The British School at Rome. He then obtained his Master of Arts at Goldsmiths College, London.\\nBrill is married to fellow artist and Goldsmiths College alumna, Jessica Voorsanger, also a contemporary artist and lecturer.\\nBrill was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the arts.\\n\\n\\n== Careers ==\\n\\n\\n=== Art ===\\n\\nBrill is commonly known as Bob and Roberta Smith in his artistic career. The pseudonym has been retained from the short lived period when he worked with his sister Roberta.\\nSmith paints slogans in a brightly coloured lettering style on banners and discarded boards of wood and exhibits them in galleries of contemporary art across the world. The slogans are usually humorous musing on art, politics, popular culture, Britain and the world in general and they often support his activist campaigns, such as his 2002 amnesty on bad art at Pierogi Gallery, New York.\\nNoted for sign painting, Smith also makes sculpture using cement, as in his 2005 Cement Soup Kitchen at Beaconsfield Gallery, London. A sculpture he proposed was shortlisted for the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, London.\\n\\n[Smith] grew attracted to postures of amateurism and failure. His more recent work has suggested an interest in the utopian impulse of art as an agent for social change, although this often seems hedged with doubt or irony\\nIn March 2005 he was commissioned to curate a series of five public art projects in the Thames Gateway housing estates of Essex. The projects were collectively named Art U Need and were documented in a diary-format book by Smith in 2007. Writing of a launch event in \"glittering Notting Hill Gate\" (i.e. in fashionable and central Kensington), Lynn Barber said of Smith: \"It was a startlingly unsuitable subject for such a glossy audience, but he held them spellbound. I see him as a sort of Ian Dury of the art world, someone who keeps on trucking, doing his own thing, making absolutely no concessions to fashion or marketability, but generally giving pleasure to everyone who comes across him.\"\\nA feature documentary about the work of Bob and Roberta Smith, Make Your Own Damn Art: the world of Bob and Roberta Smith, directed by John Rogers, premiered at the East End Film Festival in 2012.\\nIn 2013, he was on the Museum of the Year selection panel. He is on the Tate board as an artist member.\\nIn October 2021, Brill contributed to World Wildlife Fund\\'s campaign, Art For Your World.\\n\\n\\n=== Speaker, writer and advocate ===\\nHe has spoken as an advocate for art education and the arts and has been a keynote speaker at symposia and conferences. A recent example of his gift for merging art and politics was illustrated in the 2006 exhibition, \"Peace Camp.\" Smith took part in and curated the show held at The Brick Lane Gallery that explored artists\\' perceptions of peace. Gavin Turk, Wolfgang Tillmans, and more than 100 other artists were featured. He created a project, the Art Party, in 2013 to make contemporary art more accessible, demonstrate its ability to influence meaningful conversation and political thought. It was launched at the Pierogi Gallery in New York and at the Hales Gallery. An Arts Council sponsored a two-day conference at Crescent Arts in North Yorkshire that year. It brought more than 2000 people who attended discussions of art education in schools and lectures, listened to music and attended performances.\\nBrill writes for The Guardian.\\n\\n\\n=== Educator ===\\nBrill is an associate professor at the School of Art, Architecture and Design at London Metropolitan University, teaching undergraduate and post-graduate students. He leads the Master of Fine Arts programme, researches and co-leads with Oriana Fox of the Public Acts studio, and tutors in fine art.\\n\\n\\n=== Musician ===\\nBrill performs music, often with a group he co-founded, The Ken Ardley Playboys, who had their first 45 released by Billy Childish on his label Hangman Records. Brill hosts The Bob & Roberta Smith Radio Show called Make Your Own Damn Music on Resonance FM.\\n\\n\\n=== 2015 election ===\\nBrill stood in the Surrey Heath constituency in the 2015 general election, under his working name, Bob and Roberta Smith. He won the fewest votes in the constituency, receiving 273 votes (0.5%) and losing his deposit. The seat was won by incumbent MP Michael Gove.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nArts Council Collection, London\\nBritish Council, London\\nGoss Michael Foundation, Dallas, Texas\\nSammlung Fiede, Aschaffenburg, Germany\\nSouthampton City Museum & Art Gallery, Southampton, England\\nTate Collection, London\\nThe New Art Gallery Walsall, Walsall, UK\\n\\n\\n== Published works ==\\nAuthor\\nArt u need: my part in the public art revolution.

              "  'Wu Guanzhong (simplified Chinese: 吴冠中; traditional Chinese: 吳冠中; pinyin: Wú Guànzhōng; 29 August 1919 – 25 June 2010) was a contemporary Chinese painter widely recognized as a founder of modern Chinese painting. He is considered to be one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. Wu\\'s artworks display both Western and Eastern influences, such as the Western style of Fauvism and the Eastern style of Chinese calligraphy. Wu painted various aspects of China, including its architecture, plants, animals, people, as well as many of its landscapes and waterscapes, in a style reminiscent of the impressionist painters of the early 1900s. He was also a writer on contemporary Chinese art.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nWu was born in a village in Yixing, Jiangsu province, in 1919. His family wanted him to become a teacher, as his father had been. In 1935, Wu passed the entrance exam and studied electrical engineering at Zhejiang Industrial School (浙江公立工业专门学校, a technical school of Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou. While in engineering school, Wu met an art student named Zhu Dequn who was studying at the National Hangzhou Academy of Art.  During a trip to Zhu’s school, Wu got his first look at art and fell \"madly in love\" with it. Against his father’s wishes, in 1936 he transferred to the art academy, studying both Chinese and Western painting under Pan Tianshou (1897–1971), Fang Ganmin (1906–1984) and Li Chaoshi (1893-1971). \\nWu went through many trials and challenges during his years in college before he could master his craft. In 1937 the Sino-Japanese War began and the campus had to pick up and relocate in order to get out of the way of the invading Japanese army. During the constant movement during the war, Wu was able to see many different locations. He considered the adventures as a necessary journey to becoming a man and building his character. Wu benefitted greatly from the many teachers who taught him to paint and the rough journey to becoming a man.  \\nIn 1942 he graduated from Hangzhou National Academy of Art and tried to find a job. During the war jobs were hard to find and Wu took a part-time job as a substitute teacher. He later found a job as a watercolor and drawing teacher in the Architecture Department of Chongqing University.\\nAfter Wu graduated he continued to hone his craft and studied with some of his old colleagues from school, like Zhu Dequn, Li Lincan and Zheng Wei. Each of these friends continued their art careers and left their mark on the art scene.  \\nIn 1946 Wu applied for one of the two art study abroad spots and was the best applicant who applied; this was in part to his French language studies. 1947 traveled to Paris to study at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Beaux Arts on the government scholarship. Even though France was still recovering from World War II, Wu was completely enthralled with the art he saw there. He visited all of the city\\'s major museums within the first few days of his arrival. Wu was always a tremendous fan of French and European art. While in Europe, Wu realized that the many cultural and religious differences between Europe and China made it difficult for him to understand and appreciate some of the art. He took great interest in the modern art of France, especially Post-Impressionists such as van Gogh, Gauguin and Cézanne.  Wu loved van Gogh the most because of van Gogh’s passion for art and the internal torment he endured. He also identified with the hardships that Gauguin felt when he left Paris for a South Pacific island in order to find his own personal ideal. Wu\\'s trip to France helped him grasp the idea of form and the basic meaning of art. The study abroad trip also led to formalism becoming the basic underlying element of his art and studying in France helped him better understand formalism.\\nWu returned to China in the summer of 1950 to the excitement that was brought by the new People’s Republic of China government. The government assigned jobs to all of the returning students who came back after the new government took control. Everyone felt anxious and excited to contribute to the building of a new nation. Wu introduced aspects of Western art to his students at the Central Academy of Fine Art in Beijing, where he taught from 1950 to 1953. He was excited to be the first Chinese artist to return from France with knowledge and theoretical framework for French modernism. While teaching, many peers criticized him because of jealousy over his job and because he was the only painter practicing formalism. The Academy was known to have been dominated by social realism, and Wu was called \"a fortress of bourgeois formalism\". The issues became so bad he could no longer stay at the Central Academy and transferred. Between 1953 and 1964 he taught at Tsinghua University, and then Beijing Fine Arts Normal College. As a professor Wu was able to take many trips around the country and discover the expanse that was the new China.  Wu was full of ambition and energy and travelled to many locations where his peers wouldn’t go. He enjoyed the freedom of travel, which allowed him to paint or sketch wherever and whenever he wanted. This is when Wu made a transition to landscape since he travelled all over the country. He was later appointed a Professor at the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts, Beijing in 1964.\\nIn August 1966, at the outset of Mao Zedong\\'s Cultural Revolution, Wu was prohibited from painting and writing about art, and many of his early works were destroyed. In 1970, at the age of 51, he and his wife were separated and assigned to almost 3 years of hard labor in the countryside as part of the Communist Party\\'s vast re-education program.  Wu stated, “Life was only planting rice, carrying coal, criticizing one another, and fighting one another…The only thing that no one was allowed to do was paint.” \\nFollowing that period, he was only allowed to paint on Sundays (his day off from the fields) or on holidays.  He heard of artists being persecuted and even killed, so he burned his nude paintings since they would be severely criticized and frowned upon. Wu did not suffer too much physical harm, because he had destroyed many of his own paintings, but this caused him much emotional harm. Finally in 1972, he was allowed to return to Beijing to paint hotel murals and decorations.\\nDuring the 1970s, Wu changed his style based on what others were doing at the time. He started painting with oil and watercolor in a Western style until he returned to Beijing and saw other artists using watercolor in the traditional Chinese style. In 1975 a Chinese art association in Japan wanted some traditional Chinese ink paintings to exhibit. Once again Wu changed his style to match the specifications, and his work became a great hit. From here Wu moved on to another phase where he painted with oil and concentrated on the human body and the beauty of form. Wu also realized he could achieve the same beauty and form through landscape while using Chinese ink and color on paper.\\nIt was not until after Mao\\'s death in 1976 that Wu, like many of his peers, was able to return to his art-making. This opened up the door for artists to branch out international.  Unfortunately for most of the artists, there was an immense gap in artistic ideas between China and the rest of the world.  The only one who seemed able to bridge this artistic gap was Wu. With the newfound freedom, Wu was able to break away from the old constraints and get back to the formalism style he originally loved.  Along with being able to paint again, he was able to be more of a public figure in the art scene without fear of retribution.  He wrote an essay for a May 1979 issue of Meishu titled “The Beauty of Form in Painting”. He discussed his theory of formalism in the article as \\n“A vast number of workers in art now hope for the opening of European modern painting to them, to discuss the scientific nature of the beauty of form. It is the microscope and surgical knife of formal art as a means to enrich and develop heritage. Oil painting must be nationalized; Chinese painting must be modernized. It seems that only after we have seen the Japanese painter Higashiyama Kai’s explorations have we come to have a clear understanding about the problems of uniting the East and West.” \\nWu has written many other articles based on his version of form and how it applies to modernism.  He considered himself primarily a painter and not a theorist. He had the approach of going out and looking at nature to find something that piqued his interest. Then he would start with a preliminary sketch of what it was that he saw. Next he spent a great deal of time in the studio trying to figure out the best way to show the power of the form of the object. He would then paint quickly and impulsively with whatever European of Chinese brush felt right. Wu would go on painting for hours until he was too emotionally drained to continue.\\nHe had his first professional solo exhibition in 1979, and his career took off in the 1980s.  He has been the solo exhibitionist in over ten and been part of a joint exhibition in over ten others.\\nIn 1991 Wu was made an Officier de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture.\\nEarly in his career Guanzhong adopted the pen name Tu, which he used to sign his work.\\nWu died at the age of 90, during the night of June 25, 2010, in Beijing Hospital.\\n\\n\\n== Paintings ==\\n\\n\\n=== Twin Swallows ===\\nAmong many of Wu Guanzhong’s paintings, Twin Swallows was the most outstanding and representative of his search for a synthesis of Western elements into traditional Chinese painting. It is a painting that captures both the static form of traditional Jiangnan architecture and the motion of two swallows as they fly toward a tree. Geometric shapes, especially rectangles, dominate half of the painting. For example, the front walls of the houses are horizontally placed white rectangles with simple black and gray lines to depict the edges and rooftop of each building. Doorways were painted in the same minimalistic manner, yet the contrast between the darkness inside the building with the lighter door frame is prominent enough to create a sense of depth. Wu’s attention to perspective and depth in Twin Swallow is a factor that distinguishes himself from many other traditional guohua painters. Although the white walls in Twin Swallows may seem like the dominating elements in this painting, it is in fact the pair of swallows that reveals Wu’s intention behind this painting. In the 1950s, Wu returned from France to his homeland. It was also a time when Chinese art entered the phase of socialist realism. This artistic movement had encouraged many artists to create artwork in order to contribute to the Chinese society. Similarly, Wu felt obligated to pass on the knowledge that he had gained in France to the younger generations in China in order to promote the idea of a synthesis among Western and traditional Chinese art.\\n\\n\\n=== Lion Grove Garden ===\\nLion Grove Garden was painted in 1983. The subject of this painting, Lion Grove, is the largest rockery in Suzhou. Wu Guanzhong had successfully incorporated the use of lines, planes, and dots in this painting. The lines were used to express a sense of freedom, which was also what Chinese artists enjoyed after the Cultural Revolution. Unlike traditional guohua artists, Wu’s ink outlines no longer suggest the physical form of the rocks, but instead seem to suggest how Wu perceive this landscape. The forms of the rocks are shaped in diverse ways, some being round, uneven, and hollow. He paid careful attention to the ups and downs, concave and convex, caverns and peaks, and sizes of the rocks. Although the structure of the rockery is hardly identifiable in this painting, this sense of ambiguity further encourages viewers to use their imagination and look beyond what is presented in front of their eyes. About two-thirds of the paintings consist of sinuous lines and splashes of ink and colored dots, of green, yellow, purple and red, that reinforces the spontaneity and fluidity of the painting as each dot sparkles across the painting. Artistic element of planes, such as the rooftop of Suzhou-style pavilion, the bridge, and the cloister add a hint of realistic element. The foreground of this painting is a lightly shaded pale grey water where the fish reside. Although the foreground isn’t as eye-catching as the rockery, it grounds the complex elements in a stable dimension.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nMost of Wu’s early works were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  It is difficult to track down works from his early days.  Wu had an exhibit in 1942 when he was in school and it was hosted by the Sha Ping Youth Palace.\\nWu Guanzhong has had solo exhibitions in major art galleries and museums around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Taipei, Korea, France, England and the USA. His paintings were exhibited at the British Museum in 1992; Wu was the first living Chinese artist to have an exhibition there. One of his paintings, Seascape at Beidaihe (1977), was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of an exhibition of paintings from the collection of art dealer Robert H. Ellsworth [1].   His work may also be seen in the collection of the Hong Kong Museum of Art.\\nIn 2008, Wu donated 113 works to the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). This donation is the largest Wu Guanzhong donation to a public museum.  In 2010, Wu donated works to the Hong Kong Art Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Quotes by Wu Guanzhong ==\\n“Through painting landscapes I have grown to love my motherland even more and wish to be forever intoxicated in her embrace.” \\nThis particular quote gives us deeper insight to the deep appreciation for China and the land that Wu Guanzhong had.\\n“For people’s hearts to communicate, there must be genuine emotion to strike a chord. Whether the feelings and perceptions of modern Chinese can find resonance in the West depends on the emotions, if they are true or false. Intelligent viewers can discern what is real and what is false.” \\nHere, Wu Guanzhong explains that in order for people (such as those of the East and the West) to communicate there must be real emotions that can strike a chord with the other\\'s audience.\\n“Abstract beauty is the heart of the beauty of figurative art. It is a natural thing to which we all respond. As a child loves to play with a kaleidoscope, so everyone likes pure form and color.” \\nWu Guanzhong explains abstract beauty, which shows his appreciation for abstract art along with his traditional Chinese training.\\n\"So often there is conflict between them, and this is my greatest sorrow....Whatever I have written is to try to help our own people to understand and to get rid of their fear and suspicion of abstraction in Western art. So I can only start talking from a point of semi-abstract art, which is easier to understand. But even when I talked this away, recently there were lots of argument and objections.” \\nThis specific quote shows how difficult it was in China to integrate abstract Western art as a result of their fears and how this impedes Wu Guanzhong\\'s ability to freely discuss it.\\n“’Image’ exists in the objective world. Not all images are beautiful. The discerning power of the artists eye lies in its ability to recognize the beauty in images, to grasp the elements that constitute this beauty, and to bring this beauty out in his expression, thus creating a sense of sympathy in the audience!”\\nThis quote explains Wu Guanzhong\\'s belief that the audience should feel a sense of sympathy with the painting.\\n“In searching for all the marvelous peaks to make sketches, for thirty years during winter, summer, spring, and autumn, I carried on my back the heavy painting equipment and set foot in the river towns, mountain villages, thick forests, and snowy peaks – from the farthest corner of the Eastern Sea to the border towns of Tibet, from the ruins of ancient Greek Gaochang (in Xinjiang) to the isles of seagulls, I stayed in truck stops, courtyards of fishermen’s homes, factory buildings, and broken temples....In all of these I trained myself to develop endurance.” \\nWe see through this quote Wu Guanzhong\\'s struggles on his journey of becoming a landscape painter and how this resulted in him becoming stronger.\\nAll of the above quotes are from the same source\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nWu Guanzhong and his paintings at China Online Museum\\nDavid Barbosa, Once denounced, painter has China\\'s eye, The New York Times, 6 October 2005.',\n",
              "  'William Powhida (born 1976) is an American visual artist and former art critic. Powhida\\'s work is critical and addresses the contemporary art world.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nPowhida received his Master of Fine Arts in painting from Hunter College in January, 2002.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nTopics have included creating an \"enemies\" list as well as letters addressed to contemporary curators (such as Zach Feuer Gallery), collectors and critics, requesting recognition. His 2009 piece \"Relational Wall\" includes portraits sourced from Artforum\\'s \"Scene & Herd\". He also produces portraits drawn entirely from memory.\\n\\n\\n=== Early career ===\\n\\nIn 2004, Powhida began compiling lists of enemies, rendering portraits of each enemy in graphite and gouache with insults written beneath each face. Few were spared from these lists, and his father is no exception, who is identified by the word \"failure\" under his portrait. These early works, which were in an exhibition at Platform Gallery as well as galleries in Williamsburg, display the physical evidence of the artist\\'s toil, measured in sweat and coffee stains left on the paper.\\nHe followed up his initial enemy lists with a Seattle Enemies List specific to the Pacific Northwest, targeting Tacoma-based artist Dale Chihuly and the Northern spotted owl among others. The 2006 exhibition at Platform gallery debuted a drawing of over 300 small head studies entitled Everyone I\\'ve ever Met from Memory (That I Can Remember), which Brooklyn Rail critic James Kalm described as a \"meta-drawing\" demonstrating a level of ambition and commitment to carry out the kind of stoner idea many people have but most would not actually do. The exhibition also included hex drawings of then United States president George W. Bush and New York-based gallerist Zach Feuer and a fictitious Artforum Top 10 penned by himself.\\nThe New York magazine blog was featured in a New York magazine front cover, for Powhida\\'s show at the Schroeder Romero Gallery (now Schroeder Romero & Shredder) in 2007. The work from his solo exhibition This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero includes a nine-page handwritten feature that plays on a feature Ariel Levy wrote about Dash Snow for the magazine. By this time he had developed a trompe-l\\'œil technique, rendering pages from magazines as well as sheets of blue-lined notebook paper as if torn from real-world sources and taped to the wall. These sheets of notebook paper with lists titled \"Proposals\" and \"Reasons\" offer a comically distorted worldview that blurs the lines of fact and fiction in an ego-driven celebrity art culture.\\nIn a 2009 drawing called \"Post-Boom Odds\", Powhida placed speculative bets on which young artists will matter in 10 years.\\n\\n\\n=== How The New Museum Committed Suicide With Banality ===\\nPowhida produced a drawing called \"How the New Museum Committed Suicide with Banality\" for the November 2009 cover of the Brooklyn Rail. The drawing was released in an edition of 20 prints sold by two galleries that represent Powhida, New York’s Schroeder Romero & Shredder and LA’s Charlie James.\\nThe name of the drawing was taken from a post on James Wagner\\'s blog. The work features caricatures of individuals involved in the controversial New Museum exhibition, including Jeff Koons as Howdy Doody, which Edward Winkleman remarked is ironic considering how much Powhida\\'s work owes to Koons. New Museum trustee at the center of the controversy, Dakis Joannou, bought a print of Powhida’s drawing from his New York dealer for $1,500.\\nDavid W. Kiehl, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, said that drawings like this one, which accused the New Museum of cronyism, expose things that are undercover that people do not want to talk about.\\nPowhida later responded to criticism in an article published on the Art:21 blog.\\n\\n\\n=== Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville ===\\nAt Charlie James Gallery\\'s booth at the Pulse Art Fair, Powhida unveiled a 40 by 60 inch drawing he and artist Jade Townsend had produced called Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville, depicting an art world shantytown with artists, dealers, critics and curators gathering in food lines. The who\\'s who of the art world are assembled outside the convention center in which Art Basel Miami Beach is held, and which Powhida describes as \"the belly of the beast.\" In the bottom left corner, mega-collectors Marty Marguiles, Don Rubell, Charles Saatchi and Eli Broad place bets on a cockfight with miniature representations of Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons.\\nNew York magazine art critic Jerry Saltz described the drawing as \"a great big art world stink bomb\" and a much needed institutional critique. He suggested that a museum commission Powhida to produce a one-year-long project that would result in a fifteen feet high, twenty feet wide drawing of the art world as it is today.\\n\\n\\n=== #class ===\\n\\n#class was a month-long series of events at Winkleman Gallery in New York that took place between February 20 to March 20, 2010 organized by Powhida and artist Jennifer Dalton. #class invited guest artists, critics, academics, dealers, collectors and anyone else who would like to participate to examine the way art is made and seen in our culture and to identify and propose alternatives and/or reforms to the current market system.\\nPowhida has long collaborated with artist Jennifer Dalton, who worked with him to produce art world condolence cards for Art Basel in 2008 and co-directed a hypothetical, post-apocalyptic art gallery for Powhida\\'s exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nIn his review of Powhida\\'s 2009 exhibition The Writing Is on the Wall, Holland Cotter of the New York Times called Powhida an \"art world vigilante, virtuoso draftsman, compulsive calligrapher and fantasist autobiographer.\" Art critic Jerry Saltz called Powhida the second best thing to happen in 2009 in his assessment of art in New York that year, praising his drawing for the Brooklyn Rail as well as his spring exhibition at Schroeder Romero.\\nCritics have drawn comparisons between his art world diatribes and those of 18th and 19th century social critics and satirists William Hogarth, Honoré Daumier, Henri Meyer and Paul Iribe. Critics have also pointed out the site-specificity of his practice. For example, his 2009 exhibition at Charlie James Gallery drew on Los Angeles-based professional actors, voice talents, and film studios to produce his video \"Powhida (Trailer)\". Other works have investigated media portrayals of place when setting his works in New York, Seattle and Aspen, Colorado.\\nDamien Cave of the New York Times, who has called Powhida the \"gadfly of the art establishment,\" has pointed out that the artist\\'s own rising fame presents a problem for an artist who critiques the art market as feudal and celebrity obsessed. New York dealer-turned Museum of Contemporary Art director Jeffrey Deitch takes a similar stance, saying, \"The irony is that by exposing art celebrity culture, he\\'s becoming a celebrity himself... So hats off to him.\"\\nLeah Ollman of the Los Angeles Times has argued that there are two distinct voices in the artist\\'s work, both named William Powhida, Powhida the \"character\" and Powhida the \"author\". In a 2007 interview Powhida hinted at the idea, saying, \"I do a lot of writing, fiction.\"\\n\\n\\n== Lifestyle ==\\nIn the press release for This Is a Work of Fiction at Schroeder Romero, Powhida wrote, \"I can\\'t keep sitting around my studio getting drunk and yelling at my assistants forever.\" He arrived at the opening for that exhibition with a black eye and a cut. After viewing a set of Powhida\\'s drawings about a night of hard drinking and bar fights, art critic James Kalm, taking the drawings at face value, offered the artist some personal advice on sobriety. Other accounts have described a more socially-responsible artist who works as a teacher at a public high-school in Brooklyn.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nIn 2007, Powhida collaborated with Jeff Parker on the book Back of the Line published by Decode. Regina Hackett of the Post-Intelligencer compared his facility to the \"damning exactitude of a police sketch artist.\" During a reading of the book in Seattle, Powhida and Parker attempted to orchestrate an attack on one of his own works.\\n\\n\\n== Quote ==\\nPowhida has been quoted on NPR as noting that \"in one single auction, wealthy collectors bought almost a billion dollars in contemporary art at Christie\\'s in New York.\" He further  commented: \"If you had a 2 percent tax just on the auctions in New York you could probably double the NEA budget in two nights.\"\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nWilliam Powhida\\'s website\\nNew York Times Review for ABMB Hooverville\\nNew York Times Review for The Writing Is on the Wall\\nDavid Joselit\\'s review in Art Forum\\nreview by James Kalm in The Brooklyn Rail\\n[1] Schroeder Romero press release',\n",
              "  'Art & Language is an English conceptual artists\\' collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created around 1967. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art, and included many Americans.\\nFrom May 1969 the group published in England Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe Art & Language group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by Terry Atkinson (b. 1939), David Bainbridge (b. 1941), Michael Baldwin (b. 1945) and Harold Hurrell (b. 1940). The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created gallery art and presented these ideas in a journal as part of their discussions.\\nThe first issue of Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art (Volume 1, Number 1) was published in May, 1969.\\nIn 1972, the group created Index 01, consisting of 350 texts placed inside 8 filing cabinets. These texts were \"indexed according to their logical and ideological (in)compatibility\", to assert a \"critical inquiry into art practice as an art activity in itself\". The Art & Language group that exhibited in the international Documenta 5 exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of Art-Language. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by Art & Language members.\\n\\n\\n== Projects ==\\nIan Burn and Mel Ramsden co-founded The Society for Theoretical Art and Analysis in New York in the late 1960s. They joined Art & Language in 1970–71. During this time, Sarah Charlesworth and Christine Kozlov became affiliated with the group. New York Art & Language became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.\\n\\n \\nIn the early years of the 1970s, several artists joined the collective, including Ian Burn, Michael Corris, Charles Harrison, Preston Heller, Joseph Kosuth, Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith, and David Rushton. During this time the group produced numerous theoretical writings and art works.\\nDuring the mid-1970s the group was in conflict during a time when conceptual art had lost some of its \"critical bearing\" and was being institutionalized. The conflicts among the collective existed within the context of global socio-political turmoil and economic crisis as well as the \"revival of modernism.\"\\nBy the end of the decade, the only members who remained were Baldwin, Harrison and Ramsden, with the occasional participation of Mayo Thompson and the group Red Krayola with whom several recordings were made. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions.\\nIn 1986, Art & Language was nominated for the Turner Prize.\\n\\nArt & Language and the Jackson Pollock Bar collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the \"Art & Language & Luhmann\" symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium included speakers such as Catherine David, who prepared the Documenta X, and Peter Weibel, artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of an Art & Language text produced in playback by the Jackson Pollock Bar. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt.\\nAn archive of papers relating to \"New York Art & Language\" are held at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\n== Critical reception ==\\nIn 1999, Art & Language exhibited at PS1 MoMA in New York, with a major installation entitled The Artist Out of Work. This was a recollection of Art & Language\\'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, art critic Jerry Saltz wrote, \"A quarter century ago, \\'Art & Language\\' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant.\"\\nIn 2002, Beatriz Herráez, writing for Flash Art, described the Art & Language retrospective exhibition, Too Dark to Read, as \"declaration meant to ‘clarify’ the group’s practice\" as a method that is located in \"the discursive quality of its ideational system and never in isolated works.\"\\nAdrian Searle wrote in 2014: \"Art & Language is as much as anything a conversation from which work arises and goes off on its own tangent, referencing itself, dragging Art & Language’s compendious history with it as it goes. Their\\'s is an art that makes and unmakes itself, eats and regurgitates itself.\"\\n\\n\\n== Members and associates ==\\nMembers and associates include Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin, Kathryn Bigelow, Ian Burn, Sarah Charlesworth,Charles Harrison, Michael Corris,Preston Heller, Graham Howard, Harold Hurrell,Joseph Kosuth, Christine Kozlov, Nigel Lendon, Andrew Menard, Philip Pilkington, Neil Powell, Mel Ramsden, David Rushton, Terry Smith, and Mayo Thompson and Red Crayola.\\n\\n\\n== Public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nInterview with Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden about Art & Language (2011) MP3\\nArt & Language: Blurting in A & L online Hypertext version of a complete print work of 1973 by American members of Art & Language, with articles and a discussion forum.\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBailey, Robert.

She often spoke of Russell, Manitoba as being an inspiration for her later works. Karen Kilimnik studied at Temple University, Philadelphia.\\nHer installations reflected a young viewpoint of pop culture. An example of this work is her 1989 breakout The Hellfire Club Episode of the Avengers, which is composed of photocopied images, clothing, drawings, and other objects that reverentially embody the glamour, risk, and mod kitsch of the 1960s television show. The work exemplified the “scatter” style of her installations.\\nKilimnik\\'s paintings, characterised by loose brushwork, bold colors and \"thrift shop paint-by-numbers awkwardness\", are pastiches of the Old Masters and often incorporate portraits of celebrities.

              "  'Chéri Samba or Samba wa Mbimba N’zingo Nuni Masi Ndo Mbasi (born 30 December 1956) is a Congolese painter from the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is one of the best known contemporary African artists, with his works being included in the collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  A large number of his paintings are also found in The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi.  He has been invited to participate in the 2007 Venice Biennale. His paintings almost always include text in French and Lingala, commenting on life in Africa and the modern world. Samba lives in Kinshasa and Paris. \\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nOriginally, Samba\\'s name was David Samba, but in his country there was a ban on keeping/giving people a Christian first name, so he decided to change it to Samba wa Mbimba N’zingo Nuni Masi Ndo Mbasi. Later on, Samba adopted the name Chéri Samba, which he originally wanted to change to Dessinateur Samba, but didn\\'t because of his relationship with the public. His last name, Samba, has two meanings in the Kikongo language, referring to the act of prayer or the act of being judged.\\nSamba\\'s parents were associated with the Kongo culture, but Samba chooses to identify himself with the Kinshasa culture, which is the capital of his country. Samba claims that he was turned into a Catholic, while he attended school. He doesn\\'t reject or deny Christianity, which is the religion he grew up on, but he says he tries to resist any attempt to affix a confession label to his religion. After graduating from primary Catholic school, Samba went to high school. Samba maintained second in class, except for one year where he was first. In his third year, Samba quit. While in school, Samba was always drawing and remembered that his father did not like seeing him draw. Cherí Samba\\'s religion is Catholic with a Zairian twist, which influenced many of his paintings like Cherí Samba Beseeches the Cosmos.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nChéri Samba was born in Kinto M’Vuila, Democratic Republic of Congo, as the elder son of a family of 10 children. His father was a blacksmith and his mother a farmer. In 1972, at the age of 16 Samba left the village to find work as a sign painter in the capital of Kinshasa, where he encountered such artists as Moké and Bodo. This group of artists, including Samba\\'s younger brother Cheik Ledy, came to constitute one of the country\\'s most vibrant schools of popular painting.\\nIn 1975, Samba opened his own studio.  At the same time he also became an illustrator for the entertainment magazine Bilenge Info. Working both as a billboard painter and a comic-strip artist, he used the styles of both genres when he began making his paintings on sacking cloth.  He borrowed the use of \"word bubbles\" from comic-strip art, which allowed him to add not only narrative but also commentary to his compositions, thus giving him his signature style of combining painting with text. His work earned him some local fame. In 1979 Samba participated in the exhibition Moderne Kunst aus Afrika, organized in West Berlin. The exhibition was part of the program of the first festival Horizonte - Festival der Weltkulturen.\\nHe is the central figure in the 1982 documentary film Kin Kiesse, offering his thoughts on life in Kinshasa. According to the film\\'s director, Mwezé Ngangura, Samba was instrumental in the making of the film, convincing the French Ministry of Co-operation, France 2 and Congolese television that Ngangura could make a film on Kinshasa.\\nSamba\\'s breakthrough was the exhibition Les Magiciens de la Terre at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1989, which made him known internationally.\\nIn 2007, curator Robert Storr invited Samba to participate in the 52nd International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale, entitled \"Think with the Senses—Feel with the Mind. Art in the Present Tense\", and described by The Huffington Post as \"certainly  \\'the exhibition\\' of this new Century\".\\n\\n\\n== Philosophy ==\\nSamba\\'s pieces aims to emphasize poverty, stupidity about his culture, corruption, and chaos in his work. Samba says, “I appeal to people’s consciences…I paint reality even if it’s shocking, I put humor and color into it to attract people. In his piece, J\\'aime la couleur piece goes into race and self identity\". It explains how Samba believes that experience and process of sustaining and recreating a common identity across the African diaspora will show how to strengthen a community. He usually paints himself at the center of his visual social commentaries.\\n\\n\\n== Similar artists ==\\nHieronymus Bosch\\nWilliam Kentridge\\nCamille-Pierre Pambu Bodo, Bodo\\nMoké\\nAbdoulaye Konaté\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nAndré Magnin and Robert Storr, J\\'aime Cheri Samba, Paris: Fondation Cartier pour l\\'art contemporain; London/New York: Thames & Hudson, 2004, ISBN 978-0-500-97014-0.\\nFred Robarts, \"Chéri Samba: interview\", Time Out London, 28 March 2007.\\nWolfgang Bender [Ed.], Cheri Samba.

Dine\\'s work includes painting, drawing, printmaking (in many forms including lithographs, etchings, gravure, intaglio, woodcuts, letterpress and linocuts), sculpture and photography; his early works encompassed assemblage and happenings, while in recent years his poetry output, both in publications and readings, has increased.\\nDine has been associated with many art movements including Neo-Dada (use of collage and found objects), Abstract Expressionism (the gestural nature of his painting), and Pop Art (affixing everyday objects including tools, rope, articles of clothing and even a bathroom sink) to his canvases, yet he has avoided such classifications. At the core of his art, regardless of the medium of the specific work, lies an intense autobiographical reflection, a relentless exploration and criticism of self through a number of personal motifs including: the heart, the bathrobe, tools, antique sculpture, and the character of Pinocchio (among flora, skulls, birds and figurative self-portraits). Dine\\'s approach is all-encompassing: \"Dine\\'s art has a stream of consciousness quality to its evolution, and is based on all aspects of his life—what he is reading, objects he comes upon in souvenir shops around the world, a serious study of art from every time and place that he understands as being useful to his own practice.\"\\nDine has had more than 300 solo exhibitions, including retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1970), the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1978), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1984–85), Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids, Michigan (2011) and Museum Folkwang, Essen (2015–16). His work is in permanent collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Musée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Tate Gallery, London; Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, Tokyo; and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut.\\nDine\\'s distinctions include nomination to Academy of Arts and Letters in New York (1980), Commandeur de l\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003), the British Museum Medal (2015) following his donation of 234 prints to the museum in 2014, membership of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (2017), and Chevalier de l\\'Ordre de la Légion d\\'Honneur (2018).\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nDine\\'s first formal training took the form of night courses at the Art Academy of Cincinnati, in which he enrolled in 1952 at the age of 16, while attending Walnut Hills High School. It was a decision motivated both by his artistic calling and the lack of appropriate training at high school: \"I always knew I was always an artist and even though I tried to conform to high school life in those years, I found it difficult because I wanted to express myself artistically, and the school I went to had no facilities for that.\" In 1954, while still attending evening courses, Dine was inspired by a copy of Paul J. Sachs\\' Modern Prints and Drawings (1954), particularly by the German Expressionist woodcuts it reproduced, including work by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938), Emil Nolde (1867–1956) and Max Beckmann (1884–1950)—\"I was shocked by them\" — and began creating woodcuts in the basement of his maternal grandparents, with whom he was then living.\\nAfter high school Dine enrolled at the University of Cincinnati but was unsatisfied: \"They didn\\'t have an art school, they had a design school. I tried that for half a year. It was ridiculous […] All I wanted to do was paint.\" At the recommendation of a friend majoring in theatre at Ohio University in Athens, Dine enrolled there in 1955, where he recalls being \"blown away\", not by the facilities but because: \"I sensed a bucolic freedom in the foothills of the Appalachians where I could possibly develop and be an artist.\" Under printmaking teacher Donald Roberts (1923–2015) Dine experimented in lithography, etching, intaglio, dry paint and woodcuts. At Roberts\\' suggestion, Dine subsequently studied for six months with Ture Bengtz (1907–73) at the School of Fine Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, before returning to Ohio University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1957 (remaining for an additional year to make paintings and prints, with the permission of the faculty).\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\nIn 1958 Dine moved to New York, where he taught at the Rhodes School. In the same year he founded the Judson Gallery at the Judson Church in Greenwich Village with Claes Oldenburg and Marcus Ratliff, eventually meeting Allan Kaprow and Bob Whitman: together they became pioneers of happenings and performances, including Dine\\'s The Smiling Workman of 1959. Dine\\'s first exhibition was at the Reuben Gallery, where he also staged the elaborate performance Car Crash (1960), which he describes as \"a cacophony of sounds and words spoken by a great white Venus with animal grunts and howls by me.\" Another important early work was The House (1960), an environment incorporating found objects and street debris, installed at the Judson Gallery.\\nDine continued to include everyday items (including personal possessions) in his work, which linked him to Pop Art—an affinity strengthened by his inclusion in the influential 1962 exhibition \"New Painting of Common Objects\" at the Pasadena Art Museum, curated by Walter Hopps and later cited as the first institutional survey of American Pop Art, including works by Robert Dowd, Joe Goode, Phillip Hefferton, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Ruscha, Wayne Thiebaud and Andy Warhol. Dine has, however, consistently distanced himself from Pop Art: \"I\\'m not a Pop artist. I\\'m not part of the movement because I\\'m too subjective. Pop is concerned with exteriors. I\\'m concerned with interiors. When I use objects, I see them as a vocabulary of feelings. […] What I try to do in my work is explore myself in physical terms—to explain something in terms of my own sensibilities.\"\\n\\n\\n== Motifs ==\\n\\nSince the early 1960s Dine has refined a selection of motifs through which he has explored his self in myriad forms and media, and throughout the different locations/studios in which he has worked, including: London (1968–71); Putnam, Vermont (1971–85); Walla Walla, Washington (since 1983); Paris (since 2001); and Göttingen (since 2007), in a studio adjacent to the premises of Steidl, the printer and publisher of the majority of his books.\\n\\n\\n=== Bathrobes ===\\nDine first depicted bathrobes in 1964 while searching for a new form of self-portraiture at a time when \"it wasn\\'t cool to just make a self-portrait\"; he thus conceived an approach without representing his face. Dine subsequently saw an image of a bathrobe in an advertisement in the New York Times Magazine, and adopted it as a surrogate self-portrait, which he has since depicted in varying degrees of realism and expressionism.\\n\\n\\n=== Hearts ===\\nDine initially expressed this motif in the form of a large heart of stuffed red satin hung above the character of Puck in a 1965–66 production of William Shakespeare\\'s A Midsummer Night\\'s Dream at the Actors\\' Workshop in San Francisco, for which he designed the sets (his original introduction to the motif had been a series of red hearts on white backgrounds he had seen as a student). In time, the heart became for Dine \"a universal symbol that I could put paint onto\" and \"as good a structure geographically as any I could find in nature. It is a kind of landscape and within that landscape I could grow anything, and I think I did.\" The formal simplicity of the heart has made it a subject he could wholly claim as his own, an empty vessel for ongoing experimentation into which to project his changing self. The heart\\'s status as a universal symbol of love further mirrors Dine\\'s commitment to the creative act: \"…what I was in love with was the fact that I was put here to make these hearts—this art. There is a similar sense of love in this method, this act of making art…\"\\n\\n\\n=== Pinocchio ===\\n\"Trying to birth this puppet into life is a great story. It is the story of how you make art\"—Jim Dine. Dine\\'s fascination with the character of Pinocchio, the boy protagonist in Carlo Collodi\\'s The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883), dates to his childhood, when, at the age of six he viewed with his mother Walt Disney\\'s animated film Pinocchio (1940): \"It has haunted my heart forever!\" This formative experience deepened in 1964 when Dine discovered a detailed figure of Pinocchio while purchasing tools: \"It was hand painted, had a paper maché head, beautiful little clothes and articulated limbs. I took it home and I kept it on my shelf for 25 years. I did not do anything with it. I did not know what to do with it, but it was always with me. When I moved houses, I would take it and put it on the bookshelf or put it in a drawer and bring it out, essentially to play with it.\" Yet it was only in the 1990s that Dine represented Pinocchio in his art, first in a diptych; the next Pinocchios were shown at the 1997 Venice Biennale and an exhibition at Richard Gray Gallery, Chicago. Notable depictions since include the 41 color lithographs printed at Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris, in 2006; the book Pinocchio (Steidl, 2006), combining Collodi\\'s text and Dine\\'s illustrations; two monumental bronze sculptures of 9 meters\\' height: Walking to Borås (2008) in Borås, Sweden, and Busan Pinocchio (2013) in Busan, South Korea; and Pinocchio (Emotional) (2012), a twelve-foot bronze at the Cincinnati Art Museum. In recent years Dine\\'s self-identification with the character of Pinocchio has shifted to Gepetto, the gifted woodcarver who crafts the boy puppet.\\n\\n\\n=== Antique sculpture ===\\n\"I have this reverence for the ancient world. I mean Greco-Roman society. This always interested me and the product of it is interesting to me and the literature is interesting—the historic literature. I have this need to connect with the past in my way…\"—Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio, Dine\\'s fascination with antique sculpture dates to early in his life: \"I had always been interested as a child in \\'the antique,\\' because my mother took me to the art museum in Cincinnati, and they had a few beautiful pieces.\"\\nThe antique has thus been present since his early work, for example in Untitled (After Winged Victory) (1959), now held in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, a sculpture inspired by the Winged Victory of Samothrace (ca. 200 B.C.) and composed of a painted robe hung on a found lamp frame and held together with wire, which Dine describes as \"almost like outsider art\" and he first showed at the Ruben Gallery. He most frequently expresses the antique through the figure of the Venus de Milo (ca. 100 B.C.), a small plaster cast of which he bought in Paris; he initially included the cast in 1970s still-life paintings, \"But then I knocked the head off it and made it mine.\" Dine is also inspired by specific sculpture collections, for example that of the Glyptothek in Munich, which he visited in 1984, resulting in the 40 \"Glyptotek Drawings\" [sic] of 1987–88, made in preparation for a series of lithographs. Of the experience Dine recalls: \"The museum director let me come in at night and, therefore, it was a meditation on the pieces I was drawing because I was alone. I felt a link between the ages of history and me and a communication between these anonymous guys who had carved these things centuries before me. It was a way to join hands across the generations, and for me to feel that I did not just grow like a tumbleweed but that I came from somewhere. I belonged to a tradition and it gave me the history I needed.\"\\nAn important recent work that incorporates the antique is Dine\\'s Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets), an installation consisting of 8-foot wooden sculptures inspired by ancient Greek statues of dancing women arranged around a 7-foot self-portrait head of the artist, all installed in a room whose walls he has inscribed with a sprawling poem, \"with its Orphic themes of travel, loss, and the possibilities of art.\" Originally shown in 2008–09 at the Getty Villa, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, and echoing the 350–300 B.C. Sculptural Group of a Seated Poet and Sirens (2) with unjoined fragmentary curls (304) held in the Getty collection, Dine has since updated Poet Singing (The Flowering Sheets) as a permanent, site-specific installation housed in the purpose-built Jim Dine Pavilion, adjacent to the Kunsthaus Göttingen.\\n\\n\\n=== Tools ===\\n\"I never stopped being enchanted by these objects.\" — Jim Dine. As with Pinocchio and antique sculpture, tools are a motif inextricably linked to Dine\\'s childhood. His introduction to them came through his maternal grandfather, Morris Cohen, who ran The Save Supply Company hardware store in Cincinnati; Dine lived with Cohen for three years as a boy, and had daily contact with him until the age of 19. Dine recalls hammers, saws, drills, screwdrivers among various hardware paraphernalia; later, Dine worked in Cohen\\'s store on Saturdays.\\nDine was thus inaugurated both into the practical functions of tools and their aesthetic possibilities: \"I admired the beautiful enamel on the ceramic toilets and sinks. I admired the way different colors of conduit electric wire was in rolls next to each other, and the way it had been braided. In the paint department, the color charts looked to me like perfect, perfect jewel boxes.\" He recalls the sensual impact of \"very, very beautiful\" pristine white paint: \"I would play with it by sticking one of his screwdrivers in and breaking the skin and moving it around. It was like white taffy. It had a fabulous smell of linseed oil and turpentine.\" Accordingly, he finds them \"as mysterious and interesting an object as any other object. There\\'s no aristocracy here.\"\\nAs a motif that symbolizes raw materials being transformed into art — tools have unique status in Dine\\'s practice as \"artificial extensions of his hands, effectively allowing him to shape and form certain given conditions and objects more systematically,\" and as \"\\'primary objects\\' that create a connection with our human past and the hand.\" In Dine\\'s own words, the tool is fundamentally \"a metaphor for \\'work\\'\".\\nDine has integrated real tools into his art from his earliest works — for example, Big Black Work Wall (1961), a painting with tools attached, and The Wind and Tools (A Glossary of Terms) (2009), three wooden Venus statues wearing girdles belts of tools—as well as depicting them in media including paintings, drawings, photographs and prints. An extraordinary printing series involving tools is A History of Communism (2014), in which Dine printed tool motifs on top of lithographs made from stones found in an art academy in Berlin and showing four decades of students\\' work from the German Democratic Republic. By overlaying his own personal vocabulary of tools, Dine engages with the symbolic tools of communism — the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union, and the hammer and compass, ringed by rye, of the German Democratic Republic — and unsettles the assertion of any certain \"truth\", showing that \"history is never a coherent narrative—although it might be presented as such with an ulterior motive—but rather a fragmented, layered and multi-sited process.\"\\n\\n\\n== Selected teaching positions ==\\n1965 – guest lecturer at Yale University and artist-in-residence, Oberlin College, Ohio\\n1966 – teaching residency at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York\\n1993–95 – Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, Salzburg\\n1995–96 – Hochschule der Künste, Berlin\\n\\n\\n== Selected long-term collaborations ==\\n1962–76: gallerist Ileana Sonnabend, New York\\n1975–2008: printmaker Aldo Crommelynck, Paris\\n1978–2016: Pace Gallery, New York\\n1979–present: gallerist Alan Cristea, London\\n1983–2018: gallerist Richard Gray, Chicago\\n1983–present: Walla Walla Foundry, Walla Walla, Washington\\n1987–2003: printmaker Kurt Zein, Vienna\\n1991–2016: Spring Street Workshop, New York, with printers including Julia D\\'Amario, Ruth Lingen, Katherine Kuehn, Bill Hall\\n1998–present: printer and publisher Gerhard Steidl, Göttingen\\n2000–present: gallerist Daniel Templon, Paris-Brussels\\n2003–18: printmakers Atelier Michael Woolworth, Paris\\n2010–present: foundry Blue Mountain Fine Art, Baker City, Oregon\\n2016–present: printmakers Steindruck Chavanne Pechmann, Apetlon\\n2016–21: Gray Gallery, Chicago\\n\\n\\n== Selected permanent collections ==\\n\\nAllen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin\\nArt Institute of Chicago, Chicago\\nBowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, ME\\nBrooklyn Museum, Brooklyn\\nCincinnati Art Museum, Cincinnati\\nCleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland\\nFogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge\\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.\\nIndianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis\\nIsrael Museum, Jerusalem\\nLouisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humelbeak, Denmark\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis\\nMuseum Folkwang, Essen\\nMusée National d\\'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Chicago\\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York\\nNational Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\\nPalm Springs Art Museum, CA\\nSnite Museum of Art, University of Notre Dame\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Susan Hiller (March 7, 1940 – January 28, 2019) was a US-born, British conceptual artist who lived in London, United Kingdom. Her practice spanned a broad range of media including installation, video, photography, painting, sculpture, performance, artist\\'s books and writing. A key figure in British art across four decades, she was best known for her innovative large-scale multimedia installations, and for works that took as their subject matter aspects of culture that were overlooked, marginalised, or disregarded, including paranormal beliefs – an approach which she referred to as \"paraconceptualism\".\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nBorn in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1940, Susan Hiller was raised in and around Cleveland, Ohio. In 1950, her family moved to Coral Gables, Florida, where she attended Coral Gables Senior High School, graduating in 1957. She attended Smith College and received a B.A. in 1961. After spending a year in New York City studying photography, film, drawing and linguistics, Hiller went on to pursue post-graduate studies in anthropology at Tulane University in New Orleans with a National Science Foundation Fellowship, completing her Ph.D. in 1965.\\nAfter doing fieldwork in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize, with a grant from the Middle American Research Institute (1962–5), Hiller became critical of academic anthropology; she did not want her research to be part of the \"objectification of the contrariness of lived events [that was] destined to become another complicit thread woven into the fabric of \"evidence\" that would help anthropology become a science\". It was during a slide lecture on African art, that Hiller decided to become an artist. She felt art was \"above all, irrational, mysterious, numinous … [she] decided [she] would become not an anthropologist but an artist: [she] would relinquish factuality for fantasy\". This decision to begin an art practice was an effort, as the artist later recalled, to \"find a way to be inside all my activities.\"\\n\\n\\n== Career and practice ==\\nFollowing a period where she lived in France, Wales, Morocco and India, Hiller settled in London in the late 1960s, developing a practice that was innovative for its time and included a variety of media and performance-based work. She later cited minimalism, Fluxus, aspects of Surrealism and her study of anthropology as major influences on her work, as well as aspects of feminism. In the early 1970s, Hiller created participatory \"group investigations\" including Pray/Prayer (1969), Dream Mapping (1974) and Street Ceremonies (1973). These works originated in her conviction that \"art can function as a critique of existing culture and as a locus where futures not otherwise possible can begin to shape themselves.\"\\nHiller\\'s first exhibition was a group show at Gallery House in London in 1973 that she organised with her friends Barbara Ess and Carla Liss. There she presented two works, one under her own name and one using the pseudonym \"Ace Posible\" (a pun on \"es posible\", Spanish for \"make it possible\"): Transformer, 1973, a floor to ceiling grid structure with tissue paper covered with the artist\\'s marks, and Enquires, 1973, a slide show of facts collected from a British encyclopaedia that revealed the culturally partisan definitions in what was ostensibly an objective and equitable source of information. \\n\\nAfter the mid-1970s, Hiller continued her engagement with minimalism. For the artwork entitled 10 Months (1977–79), she took photographs of her pregnant body and kept a journal documenting the subjective aspects of her pregnancy. The final work comprises ten gridded blocks of twenty-eight black and white photographs, each block corresponding to a lunar month. The images are accompanied by excerpts from her journal entries for the same period. These components are installed on the wall in a stepped pattern that descends from left to right. Lisa Tickner observed,The sentimentality associated with images of pregnancy is set tartly on edge by the scrutiny of the woman/artist who is acted upon, but who also acts: who enjoys a precarious status as both the subject and the object of her work ... The echoes of landscape, the allusions to ripeness and fulfilment, are refused by the anxieties of the text, and by the methodical process of representation. The work was considered controversial when first exhibited in London. \\nOver the course of her career, Hiller became known for making use of everyday phenomena and cultural artefacts from our society that commonly were overlooked, denigrated, or marginalised Such cultural artefacts included postcards, dreams, Punch & Judy shows, reports of UFO sightings, reports of near-death experiences, horror movies, bedroom wallpapers, street signs, ceramics, and extinct languages. Using the techniques of collecting and cataloguing, presentation and display, she transformed these everyday pieces of ephemera into art works that offer a means of exploring the inherent contradictions in our collective cultural life, as well as the individual and collective unconscious and subconscious. As an artist, she was interested in the areas of our cultural collective experience that are concerned with devalued or irrational experiences: the subconscious, the supernatural, the surreal, the mystical and the paranormal. She engaged with such experiences and phenomena which defy logical or rational explanation through the rational scientific techniques of taxonomy, collection, organization, description and comparison. She did not, however, apply systems of judgment to the work, refraining from ever categorising the experiences as \"true\" or \"false\", \"fact\" or \"fiction\". \\nMany of her works explore the liminality of certain phenomena including the practice of automatic writing (Sisters of Menon, 1972/79; Homage to Gertrude Stein, 2010), near death experiences (Clinic, 2004) and collective experiences of unconscious, subconscious and paranormal activity (Dream Mapping, 1974; Belshazzar\\'s Feast, 1983–4; Dream Screens, 1996; PSI Girls, 1999; Witness, 2000). Borrowing strategies from Minimalism to apply a \"rational\" framework to these products of the unconscious, the artist mounted the work Sisters of Menon in four L-shaped frames that, when installed on the wall together with four individually framed pages of her own commentary, make a cruciform. Hiller also published Sisters of Menon as an artist\\'s book. She insisted on blurring the boundaries between cultural definitions of \"rational\" and \"irrational\", at the same time reinstating the validity of the unconscious as a source of knowledge or truth.\\nBeginning in the 1980s, Hiller incorporated the use of audio and visual technology as a means of investigating these phenomena, allowing the visitor to \"make visions from ambiguous aural and visual cues\".  \\n\\nHiller described her practice as \"paraconceptual\", a neologism that places her work between the conceptual and the paranormal. In describing Hiller\\'s work, art historian Alexandra Kokoli notes that Hiller\\'s work unearths the repressed permeability ... of ... unstable yet prized constructs, such as rationality and consciousness, aesthetic value and artistic canons. Hiller refers to this precarious positioning of her oeuvre as \\'paraconceptual,\\' just sideways of conceptualism and neighbouring the paranormal, a devalued site of culture where women and the feminine have been conversely privileged. In the hybrid field of \\'paraconceptualism,\\' neither conceptualism nor the paranormal are left intact ... as ... the prefix \\'para\\'- symbolizes the force of contamination through a proximity so great that it threatens the soundness of all boundaries.\\nHiller died in London on January 28, 2019, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 78.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\nConceptual Painting (1970–1984) - Existing canvas works by Hiller that were cut up and reassembled into painting \"blocks\", their surfaces transformed into volumes.\\nRelics (begun 1972) - Hiller burnt earlier works and exhibited the ashes in vials and other scientific containers, as an act not of destruction but of transubstantiation.

During the 1980s she lectured at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. British artists who were taught by Hiller include Sonia Boyce, Zarina Bhimji, Tacita Dean, Douglas Gordon, and Jane and Louise Wilson. \\nFollowing her departure from the Slade, Hiller served as Distinguished Visiting Professor of Fine Art at California State University, Long Beach in 1988; Visiting Arts Council Chair at UCLA, Los Angeles in 1991–92;,  Professor of Art at University of Ulster, Belfast 1991–98; and Baltic Professor of Fine Art at University of Newcastle 1999–2002.\\nHiller was well known for her writing and lecturing about art. To date, two collections of texts by Hiller have been published, \"Thinking About Art: Conversations with Susan Hiller\" and \"The Provisional Texture of Reality: Selected Talks and Texts 1977-2007\".\\nIn 1976, she co-authored with David Coxhead the art-historical book Dreams: Visions of the Night, about the representation of dreams and dreaming across a variety of cultures and artistic traditions.\\nIn 1991, she edited the cross-disciplinary volume The Myth of Primitivism, deriving from a series of seminars she had organised at the Slade. Bringing together newly commissioned essays by a variety of artists, art historians and anthropologists – including Rasheed Areen, Guy Brett, Lynne Cooke, Jimmie Durham, Edgar Heap of Birds, and Signe Howell – it explored the fusion of myth, history and geography which leads to ideas of primitivism, and looked at their construction, interpretation and consumption in Western culture.   \\nIn 2000, Hiller curated the Hayward Touring exhibition Dream Machines. Taking its title from the Dreamachine created by Brion Gysin and Ian Sommerville – who Hiller had got to know in the 1960s – the show reflected Hiller\\'s longstanding interest in artworks designed to induce reverie and explore altered states of consciousness. Gathering together historical and contemporary artworks, the exhibition was largely responsible for reigniting interest in the Dreamachine amongst a new generation of British artists after a period of relative neglect. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue with texts by Hiller and Jean Fisher.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHiller\\'s works are included in numerous international public and private collections including the Tate Gallery, London; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Pompidou, Paris; National Portrait Gallery, London; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; British Museum, London; Ludwig Museum, Cologne; Serralves Foundation, Porto; Colby College Museum of Art, Colby, Maine; Ella Fontanals Cisneros Foundation, Miami; Frac Bourgogne, Dijon; Henie–Onstad Kunstsenter, Oslo; Henry Moore Sculpture Collection, Leeds; Inhotim, Brumadhino, Brazil; Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Moderner Museet, Stockholm; National Gallery of Art South Australia, Adelaide; Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Providence, Rhode Island; Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Massachusetts; Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography; Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\\n\\n\\n== Art fellowships and awards ==\\n1968 Karolyl Foundation, Vence, France (residency)\\n1969 Ministère des Beaux Arts, Morocco (residency)\\n1975 Artist in Residence, University of Sussex, Brighton (GB)\\n1976 Gulbenkenian Foundation]Visual Artist\\'s Award  (GB)\\n1977 Gulbenkenian Foundation Visual Artist\\'s Award (GB)\\n1981 Greater London Arts Association Bursary (GB)\\n1982 Visual Arts Board Travelling Fellowship (Australia), National Foundation for the Arts Fellowship (USA)\\n1998 Guggenheim Fellowship in Visual Art Practice (USA)\\n2002 DAAD residency, Berlin, 2002–2003 (Germany)\\nKulturstifung des Bundes, Halle (Germany)\\nCouvent des Recollets residency, Paris\\n\\n\\n== Selected catalogues and monographs ==\\nSusan Hiller: Recent Works, essays by David Elliott, Susan Hiller, Caryn Faure Walker.

              "  'Dennis Oppenheim (September 6, 1938 – January 21, 2011) was an American conceptual artist, performance artist, earth artist, sculptor and photographer. Dennis Oppenheim\\'s early artistic practice is an epistemological questioning about the nature of art, the making of art and the definition of art: a meta-art that arose when strategies of the Minimalists were expanded to focus on site and context. As well as an aesthetic agenda, the work progressed from perceptions of the physical properties of the gallery to the social and political context, largely taking the form of permanent public sculpture in the last two decades of a highly prolific career, whose diversity could exasperate his critics.\\n\\n\\n== Biography and Education ==\\nOppenheim\\'s father was a Russian immigrant and his mother a native of California. Oppenheim was born in Electric City, Washington, while his father was working as an engineer  on the Grand Coulee Dam. Soon after, his family returned to their home in the San Francisco Bay area. Oppenheim attended Richmond High school.\\n\\nHe later attended the California College of Arts and Crafts, where he met his first wife, Karen Marie Cackett. Oppenheim and Cackett moved to Honolulu, where he taught at the University of Hawaii and they had their first child, Kristin, in 1959. In 1962  they had their second child, Erik. In 1964, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and an MFA from Stanford University in Palo Alto in 1965. He moved to New York in 1966 and taught art at a nursery school in Northport and a junior high school in Smithtown, Long Island, while working toward his first one-person New York show in 1968 when he was 30 years old. His third child, Chandra, was born to Phyllis Jalbert that year.\\nIn 1981 he married the sculptor Alice Aycock who remained a close friend. In 1998 he married Amy Plumb and they remained married.  Oppenheim occupied a live-work loft in Tribeca from 1967 until his death from cancer on January 21, 2011, aged 72.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\nConceptual works:\\nExecuted in New York, Paris and Amsterdam and documented in photography, the series Indentations (1968)  consisted of the removal of objects, exposing the impression of each object at that location. Viewing Stations (1967) were built as platforms for observing land vistas, suggesting an embodied notion of vision. The artist presents the base as the art itself, a viewer becomes an object to be looked at, a conceptual reversal.\\nEarthworks:\\nSocial systems were overlaid on natural systems in Oppenheim\\'s earthworks. In Annual Rings (1968) the schemata of lines depicting the annual growth of a tree was mapped by plowing snow on opposite sides of St. John\\'s River, the boundary of the US and Canada. The earthwork relates geo-political boundaries, time zones, growth of the tree and entropic decay in a seminal site-specific work.\\nBody – performance works:\\nOppenheim\\'s body art grew out of his awareness of his own body when executing earthworks. In these works, the artist\\'s body was both the subject and the object, providing the opportunity to work on a surface not exterior to the self, giving total control over the artwork. These body art actions were later assimilated into the canon of performance art. For Reading Position for Second Degree Burn (1970) Oppenheim lay on a beach for five hours with an open book on his chest, exposing himself to the sun. Oppenheim describes the piece as a corporeal enactment of painting, going on to state \"I could feel the act of becoming red.\".\\nGenetic works:\\nA series of works were made in collaboration with Oppenheim\\'s children, whom he saw as extensions of himself. In a diptych titled 2- Stage Transfer Drawing. (Advancing to a Future State)., he makes a drawing on a wall at the same time that his son attempts to replicate the drawing on his father\\'s back, a procedure reversed in 2- Stage Transfer Drawing. (Returning to a Past State). (1971) when he replicates the drawing on his son\\'s back. Recorded in still photography, film and videotape,  the performances were first exhibited as floor-to ceiling loop film projections. He also collaborated with his first wife in Forming Sounds (1972) and referred to his father, David Oppenheim, in the works Polarties (1972) and Identity Transfer (1970).\\nFilm / video installations:\\nOppenheim began to produce installation art in the early seventies. These works were often autobiographical. In Recall  (1974), a video monitor is an installation component, positioned in front of a pan of turpentine. The monitor shows a close up of Oppenheim\\'s mouth as he verbalizes a stream-of-consciousness monologue induced by the smell, on his experiences in art school in the fifties.\\nPost-performance- biographical works:\\nIn a series of eight works Oppenheim called \"post-performance,\" the artist spoke through his surrogate performance figures  about the end of the avant-garde, his own art-making, in dialogue as opposites or as in Theme for a Major Hit (1974) acted under motorized control to a rock song with his lyrics, \"It ain’t what you do, it’s what makes you do it,\" recorded by a band of Soho artists. Reflecting the underlying content of the post-modern, it is an \"analysis of its own origins\" with an \"awareness of its vulnerability.\"\\nMachineworks:\\nIn the early eighties, room size sculptural installations took the form of factories and machines to visualize the genesis of an artwork before it becomes form. Final Stroke- Project for a Glass Factory (1981) analogized thinking patterns as moving parts. Vacuum cleaners and powered heaters activated raw material through sieves, troughs, stacks and vents, as the stages of processing in the production of ideas. The machines became projection structures for fireworks, producing thought lines in the air, as in Newton Discovering Gravity (1984).\\nSculpture:\\nWhile he continues to use sound, light and motion in the sculptural work in the late eighties, the imagery includes ordinary objects in different scales or as a collision of objects. In several works, animals appear. A group of taxidermy deer produce flames from the tips of their antlers, in Digestion. Gypsum Gypsies. (1989).\\nPublic Sculpture:\\nOppenheim experimented with titled and cantilevered form in Device to Root Out Evil (1997). Included as part of the Venice Biennale, it uses hand blown Venetian glass on the country church\\'s roof and steeple.  In 1999,  a version using translucent corrugated fiberglass was installed as a permanent work in Palma de Mallorca. In the commissioned public work that followed,  Oppenheim integrated the function of the building or the site in the work itself. Jump and Twist (1999) is an industrial, anthropologic work in three parts;  on the plaza, through the facade of the building and suspended from the atrium\\'s ceiling as translucent rotating form. The public work Light Chamber (2011) at the Justice Center in Denver, is an open room with translucent walls derived from the petals of many flowers.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEngagement (sculpture)\\nRadiant Fountains, Houston, Texas\\nStill Dancing\\nFormula compound, Fattoria di Celle- Collezione Gori, Pistoia\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Flower Arrangement for Bruce Nauman, Multiples, Inc., New York, 1970.\\nGlusberg, Christian, Nine Days with Dennis Oppenheim, El Centro de Arte y Comunicación, Buenos Aires, 1971.\\nFels, Mathias, Dennis Oppenheim, 1967-1971, Paris, 1972.\\nPluchart, Francois, Dennis Oppenheim 1967-1971, Mathias Felds and Editions CEDIC, Paris, 1972.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Dennis Oppenheim, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 1974.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Indentations, Gallerie Yaki Kornblit, Amsterdam, 1974.\\nVan Tieghem, Jean-Pierre, Dennis Oppenheim, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, 1975.\\nOppenheim, Dennis, Dennis Oppenheim Proposals 1967-1974, Lebeer-Hossman, Brussels, 1975.\\nParent, Alain (ed.), Dennis Oppenheim: Retrospective - Works 1967-1977, Musee d’Art Contemporain, Montreal, 1978.\\nAmmann, Jean-Christophe, Dennis Oppenheim, Kunsthalle Basel, Basel, 1979.\\nWeyl, Dr. Martin, Dennis Oppenheim, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1979.\\nInstitute of Contemporary Art, Machineworks, Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, 1981.\\nTeicher, Hendel and Poser, Steven,  Dennis Oppenheim, Galerie Eric Franck, Geneva, 1981.\\nFox, Howard N., Metaphor, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 1982.\\nGuralnik, Nehema, Factories, Fireworks, 1979-1989, The Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984.\\nJoyaux, Alain G., Dennis Oppenheim: Accelerator for Evil Thoughts, Ball State University Art Gallery, Muncie, 1985.\\nCollins, Tricia and Milazzo, Richard, Dennis Oppenheim Recent Works, Liverpool Gallery, Brussels, 1990.\\nKolokotronis, Yannis and Reid, Calvin, Dennis Oppenheim Retrospective 1970-1990, Pierides Museum of Contemporary Art,  Athens, 1990.\\nG.

              "  'Enrique Martínez Celaya (born June 9, 1964) is a contemporary Cuban-born painter, sculptor, author and former physicist whose work has been exhibited and collected by major international institutions. He trained and worked as a laser physicist, completing all coursework for his doctorate, before devoting himself full-time to his artwork. He holds master\\'s degrees in physics and fine arts and has authored books on art and philosophy as well as scientific articles. He is currently a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College, and the Provost Professor of Humanities and Arts at USC.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nMartínez Celaya was born on June 9, 1964, in Havana, Cuba, and spent his early childhood in Nueva Paz and Los Palos, Cuba. His family relocated to Madrid, Spain in 1972. While there, he took up drawing at the age of eight. In 1975, the family relocated again, this time to Puerto Rico. He initiated his formal training as an apprentice to a painter at the age of 12 and developed his early interest in writing and philosophy.\\nIn 1982 he enrolled at Cornell University. He graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics and a minor in Electrical Engineering in 1986. He was selected as a Regent\\'s Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and earned a Master of Science degree with a specialization in Quantum Electronics While there, he patented several laser devices. He later enrolled in the M.F.A. program at the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated with highest honors in 1994.  After graduation, he attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nAbout his interest in literature, Martínez Celaya states, “Reading is a primary source for my work.\" I read philosophy and literature and that is the universe I see my work in, even though I\\'m a visual artist. ... Often when artists talk about writers, they\\'re talking about them as source of content. I\\'m reading them for a moral stance in the world.”\\nMartinez Celaya has created solo museum exhibitions for the Hispanic Society Museum & Library in New York City (2024), the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana, Cuba (2023), and the Marino Marini Museum in Florence, Italy (2023). He has also created projects for the Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California (2021), The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (2016), and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia (2012).\\nFrom 2007–2009, Martínez Celaya wrote a blog on his website with a selection of entries published as The Blog: Bad Time for Poetry (Whale & Star, 2010). Since 2012, the blog has continued in the form of journal entries on the artist\\'s personal website. The University of Nebraska Press published a twenty-year survey of his writings in 2011, entitled Collected Writings and Interviews, 1990-2010, which was more recently followed by a second volume, Collected Writings and Interviews, 2010-2017. Martínez Celaya published a selection of lecture notes from his popular workshops, entitled On Art and Mindfulness: Notes from the Anderson Ranch (Whale & Star, 2015), in collaboration with the Anderson Ranch Art Center in Snowmass, Colorado. Martínez Celaya founded Whale and Star in 1998, an imprint that specializes in art and its relationship to other intellectual and creative fields, especially literature, philosophy, and critical theory.\\n\\n\\n== Academic positions ==\\nMartínez Celaya is currently Provost Professor of Humanities and Arts at USC (2017–present) in Los Angeles and a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College (2014–present). He was the Roth Family Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Dartmouth (2016-2017). He was Visiting Presidential Professor in the history of art at University of Nebraska (2007–2010), and an associate professor of art at Pomona College and the Claremont Graduate University, (1993-2003).\\nIn 2010, Martínez Celaya inaugurated The Lecture Project, funded with assistance from the Knight Foundation. The original programming presented lectures from academics and art critics until late 2012.

              "  'Candida Höfer (born 4 February 1944) is a German photographer. She is a renowned photographer known for her exploration of public spaces and architecture. In her career she transitioned from portraiture to focusing on spaces like libraries and museums. She is a former student of Bernd and Hilla Becher. Like other Becher students, Höfer\\'s work is known for technical perfection and a strictly conceptual approach. Her work explores the ways in which institutional architecture shapes and directs human experience. Höfer\\'s technical approach is reflective of her goals as an artist.\\nFrom 1997 to 2000, she taught as professor at the Hochschule für Gestaltung, Karlsruhe. Höfer is the recipient of the 2018 Outstanding Contribution to Photography award, as part of the Sony World Photography Awards. She is based in Cologne.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCandida Höfer was born in 1944 in Eberswalde, Province of Brandenburg. Höfer is a daughter of the German journalist Werner Höfer. From 1964 to 1968 Höfer studied at the Kölner Werkschulen (Cologne Academy of Fine and Applied Arts). After graduation, she began working for newspapers as a portrait photographer, producing a series on Liverpudlian poets. From 1970 to 1972, she studied daguerreotypes while working as an assistant to Werner Bokelberg in Hamburg. She later attended the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1973 to 1982, where she studied film under Ole John and, from 1976, photography under Bernd Becher. Along with Thomas Ruff, she was one of the first of Becher\\'s students to use color, showing her work as slide projections. While at school, she conceived a film she shot jointly with Tony Morgan in the Düsseldorf ice cream parlour Da Forno in 1975.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nHöfer initially worked with black-and-white photography, such as with Flipper (1973), a large photo-collage consisting of 47 gelatin silver prints. The images all depict pinball machines in arcades and pubs, sometimes seen with players and sometimes by themselves. Shortly afterwards, she began working on her \\'Türken in Deutschland\\' (Turks in Germany) series (1973–1979), which follows Turkish migrant families in their new German homes. It was during this period that Höfer became interested in color, as she felt it suited her works better, and in interior spaces and their impact on the people who inhabit them and vice versa.\\nHöfer began taking color photographs of interiors of public buildings, such as offices, banks, and waiting rooms, in 1979. Her breakthrough to fame came with a series of photographs showing guest workers in Germany, after which she concentrated on the subjects Interiors, Rooms and Zoological Gardens. Höfer specializes in large-format photographs of empty interiors and social spaces that capture the \"psychology of social architecture\". Her photographs are taken from a classic straight-on frontal angle or seek a diagonal in the composition. She tends to shoot each actionless room from an elevated vantage point near one wall so that the far wall is centered within the resulting image. From her earliest creations, she has been interested in representing public spaces such as museums, libraries, national archives or opera houses devoid of all human presence. Höfer\\'s imagery has consistently focused on these depopulated interiors since the 1980s. Höfer groups her photographs into series that have institutional themes as well as geographical ones, but the formal similarity among her images is their dominant organizing principle.\\nIn her Zoologische Gärten series (1991), Höfer shifted her focus away from interiors to zoos in Germany, Spain, England, France and the Netherlands. Implementing her typically descriptive style, Höfer\\'s images again seek to deconstruct the role institutions play in defining the viewer\\'s gaze by documenting animals in their caged environments.\\nIn 2001, for Douze-Twelve, commissioned by the Musée des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle in Calais and later shown at Documenta 11, Höfer photographed all 12 casts of Auguste Rodin\\'s The Burghers of Calais in their installations in various museums and sculpture gardens. From 2004 to 2007, she traveled the world to photograph conceptual artist On Kawara\\'s iconic Date Paintings in the homes of private collectors. In 2005, Höfer embarked upon a project at the Musée du Louvre, documenting its various galleries, examining not only the sacred art they exhibit but also their individual design, arches, tiles and embellishments, with spectators and tourists entirely absent.\\n\\n\\n== Interpretation in Institutional Photography ==\\nCandida Höfer\\'s photography, particularly her Libraries series, extends beyond architectural documentation to provide a detailed examination of institutional culture. The works parallel Sharon Macdonald\\'s ethnographic study of the Science Museum in London. Höfer\\'s images, marked by the absence of human presence, enable viewers to focus on the undisturbed tranquility and vibrant colors of spaces such as the British Library and the Whitney Museum. This \"architecture of absence\" draws attention to the unseen labor and institutional decisions that shape visitor experiences. Her large-scale photographs capture the essence of library spaces, emphasizing architectural beauty, intricate interior details, and the interplay of light and shadow. Höfer\\'s precise use of symmetry and composition enhances the visual impact and documents the cultural and historical significance of these spaces. By highlighting architectural elements and institutional structures, her work reveals the complex interplay between architecture, institutional directives, and cultural representation. Höfer\\'s focus on textures and materials adds a tactile dimension, intending to encourage viewers to imagine the physical sensations of these grand spaces. Some readings of her work adopt a ethnographic and thematic organization enhancing an understanding of how institutional spaces are designed and experienced, exploring the social architecture and cultural narratives inherent within these environments.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nHöfer\\'s first solo exhibition was in 1975 at the Konrad Fischer Galerie in Düsseldorf. Since then, Höfer has had solo exhibitions in museums throughout Europe and the United States, including the Centro de Fotografía at the Universidad de Salamanca, the Galerie de l’École des Beaux-Arts in Valenciennes, the Kunsthalle Bremen, the Louvre, the Kunsthalle Nürnberg, the Kunsthaus Hamburg, the Museum of Contemporary Photography (MoCP)), the Museum Folkwang, and the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn She has also had an exhibition at the Portikus in Frankfurt am Main. She was apart of the \"German Photography: Documentation and Introspection\" at Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in 1990 as one of nine artists highlighted. In 2001 she was apart of \"Minimalismos: Un Signo de los Tiempos\" at Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía. She was included by Okwui Enwezor in Documenta 11 in Kassel in 2002. In 2003 the artist represented Germany with the late Martin Kippenberger in the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, which was curated by Julian Heynen. The first comprehensive North American survey of her work was shown under the title Architecture of Absence at Norton Museum of Art in 2006. That same year, she had a solo exhibition at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. She is currently represented by Sean Kelly Gallery and Kotaro Nukaga in Japan.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nThe highest price reached by one of her photographs was when Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra IV (2006) sold by £80,500 ($121,233) at Christie\\'s London, on 12 February 2015.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nHöfer lives and works in Cologne.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2018: Outstanding Contribution to Photography award, Sony World Photography Awards\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\nHöfer\\'s work is held in the following permanent public collections:\\n\\nJewish Museum, New York\\nSolomon R.

              "  'Graham Nicholls (born 30 July 1975) is a British author, installation artist and specialist on out of body experiences. He speaks widely on parapsychology, ethics and art at institutions ranging from the London Science Museum, The Society for Psychical Research to the Cambridge Union Society.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nGraham Nicholls was born in the Paddington district of central London into a working-class family. He states that during his early life he was surrounded by crime and social problems, but that the influence of literature, art, science and spiritual philosophies helped him to look beyond the limitations of this environment.\\n\\n\\n== Art career ==\\nSince the early 1990s Nicholls has developed artistic works that explore subjects such as sensory deprivation, hypnosis, and psi abilities. Nicholls had his first solo show at a gallery run by James Fuentes in New York City in July 1999 and in 2004 developed many of his psychological ideas into an interactive virtual reality installation called The Living Image. The installation was a collaboration between Graham Nicholls, 3D designer Roma Patel, and site-specific artist Trudi Entwistle at London\\'s Science Museum, much of which was based upon Nicholls\\'s life and locations from his childhood. The project was the subject of an academic study into the impact of virtual reality and installation art, the details of which were later published in two books dealing with scenography and performance. Technology and science, such as that used in The Living Image project, take a central role in his artistic output, his virtual web projects being considered internationally recognised by the Handbook of the economics of art and culture.\\n\\n\\n== Out-of-body experiences ==\\nNicholls claims to have had out of body experiences (OBEs) since the age of approximately twelve years old. These experiences led him to study many aspects of parapsychology. In 2009 Nicholls outlined his experiences and ideas relating to OBEs in an article that appeared in Kindred Spirit magazine. In the article he makes it clear that he believes mainstream science will eventually fully embrace psi, or psychical perceptions as natural, rather than supernatural or paranormal.\\nAs part of his inquiry into psi and human consciousness, in 2009 he began working on a series of telepathy experiments in a joint project with controversial scientist Rupert Sheldrake. The resulting data formed part of Rupert Sheldrake\\'s research as director of the Perrott-Warrick project, administered by Trinity College, Cambridge.\\n\\n\\n=== Veridical cases ===\\nNicholls also claims to have had several veridical out-of-body experiences. In his books, articles and in recent videos published he gives examples of his out-of-body experiences that have been witnessed and confirmed by others. The videos feature the witnesses describing what they saw and recorded in notes at the time of the OBEs supporting Nicholls version of events. He also outlines an example of a claimed objective OBE in his October 2011 article for the journal of The Institute of Noetic Sciences. Skeptics would generally dispute such claims as unreliable and impossible by current understandings of science.\\n\\n\\n=== Skepticism ===\\nIn the October 2012 issue of The Psychologist, the journal of the British Psychological Society, a review of Navigating the Out-of-Body Experience by Graham Nicholls, criticised him for failing \"to take into account psychometric properties (e.g. reliability and validity)\" in the questionnaire section of the book. The reviewer went on to state that the book \"does not meet the standards required by professional psychologists\".\\nWell known sceptic and critic of parapsychology James Randi also responded to an article about Nicholls that appeared in 2011 asking why those mentioned in the article, including Dean Radin, Rupert Sheldrake, Michael Persinger, and Graham Nicholls have not applied for the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge. Nicholls penned a response to Randi expressing doubts towards Randi\\'s honesty, scientific credibility, and the limits of a single test to explore issues such as the existence of OBEs.\\n\\n\\n== Activism ==\\nIn 2004 Nicholls founded an organisation called the Shahmai Network with a special focus on work towards relieving poverty, as well as human rights. The network were official members of the Make Poverty History campaign focused on campaigning for debt relief to countries in situations of extreme poverty, this culminated with protests aimed to influence the G8 conference, which took place in 2005.\\nBeyond poverty he is also interested in the various social justice issues. According to a 2012 book on polyamory, Nicholls supports LGBT issues, polyamory, and feminism. \\nIn 2009 he founded www.polyamory.org.uk, the United Kingdom\\'s first website about polyamory; at the time he was in a polyamorous triad with two female partners.\\nHe is also an outspoken supporter of animal rights and veganism; in a recent interview he states that he has been vegetarian since 1992 and went vegan in 2005. He also states that \"Veganism was the obvious next step in my ethical understanding and one that avoids supporting violent and exploitative practices.\"\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nAvenues of the Human Spirit (2011) ISBN 978-1-84694-464-2\\nNavigating the Out-of-Body Experience: Radical New Techniques (2012) ISBN 978-0-7387-2761-5\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nExtraordinary Out-of-Body Experience – A video detailing a witnessed OBE, 2013\\nInterview with AfterlifeTV – A video interview with Bob Olson, 2012\\nAvenues of the Human Spirit – Interview about Nicholls\\' first book, science and scepticism, 2011\\nOut-of-Body Experiences: In Search of the Truth – Article by Graham Nicholls for Noetic Now, the journal of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, 2011\\nSkeptical Investigations Archived 21 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine – A report on TAM London by Graham Nicholls, 2010',\n",
              "  'François Morellet (30 April 1926 – 10 May 2016) was a French contemporary abstract painter, sculptor, and light artist. His early work prefigured minimal art and conceptual art and he played a prominent role in the development of geometrical abstract art and post-conceptual art.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nMorellet began to make still-life paintings at the age of 14 as he studied Russian literature in Paris. After completing his studies, he returned to Cholet in 1948, where he continued to paint, now in the spirit of the COBRA movement. After this short period of figurative/representational work, Morellet turned to abstraction in 1950 after encountering the Concrete art of Max Bill. Morellet then adopted a pictorial language of simple geometric forms: lines, squares and triangles assembled into two-dimensional compositions.  \\nIn 1960, he was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel (GRAV), with fellow artists Francisco Sobrino, Horatio Garcia-Rossi, Hugo DeMarco, Julio Le Parc, Jean-Pierre Yvaral (the son of Victor Vasarely), Joël Stein, Vera Molnár and François Molnár (the last two left the group shortly after). Morellet began at this time to work with neon tube lighting.\\nFrom the 1960s on, Morellet worked in various materials (fabric, tape, neon, walls...) and in doing so investigated the use of the exhibition space in terms similar to artists of installation art and environmental art.  He gained an international reputation, especially in Germany and France, and he was commissioned to create work for public and private collections in Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.S. One of his works is part of the permanent collection of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany. In 2016/2017, the CILA staged a retrospective of Morellet\\'s Light Art, the last exhibition to be curated by the artist himself, shortly before his death in May 2016.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nMorellet\\'s abstract ideal was, he said, tempered by the charming nihilism of Marcel Duchamp. For him, a work of art referred only to itself. \\nHis titles are generally sophisticated, show some Duchampian word play, and describe the \"constraints\" or \"rules\" that he used to create them. Like other contemporary artists who use constraints and chance (or the aleatory) in their works, such as John Cage in music and the Oulipo group in literature, Morellet used rules and constraints established in advance to guide the creation of his works while also allowing chance to play a role in some of his compositions. This dialectic between the rigid rule-based procedure and chance situates his work within the Post-conceptual art category.\\nHis rigorous use of geometry tends to create emotionally neutral work, and also placed him close to Minimal art and Conceptual art in his aims. He shared a particular affinity to the American artists Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella and Sol LeWitt.\\n\\nSeries: Répartitions aléatoires (\"Chance divisions\") from the 1950s\\nRépartition de 16 formes identiques - painted after his visit to the Alhambra of Granada\\nSeries: Trames from the 1950s\\nSeries: Désintégrations architecturales (\"Architectural disintegrations\") from 1971\\nSeries: Géométrées from 1983\\nSeries: Défigurations from 1988\\nSeries: Déclinaisons de pi (\"Versions of pi\") from 1998\\n\\n\\tAlbum de 10 sérigraphies sur 10 ans (1952-1961), François Morellet, 1975, Musée Groninger\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nApril 10, 2016, the first François Morellet Prize (awarded to a personality for his writings on art) was awarded to Catherine Millet by Philippe Méaille.

              "  'Peter Howson OBE (born 27 March 1958) is a Scottish painter. He was a British official war artist in 1993 during the Bosnian War.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nPeter Howson was born in London of Scottish parents and moved with his family to Prestwick, Ayrshire, when he was four. His grandmother gave him a small set of oil paints when he was six. He was raised in a religious family and the first ever painting he did was a Crucifixion, when he was 6 years old. At school he was bullied but found solace in art, and was greatly inspired by his art teacher, Helen Lees, who offered him extra tuition. He trained at Glasgow School of Art but was surprised to fail the first year and forced to repeat. He hated the second year in which he was asked to paint still lifes and dropped out, joining the army in 1977. He trained in the army at Glencorse Barracks near Edinburgh. After less than a year in the army he re-enrolled in Glasgow School of Art in 1979 under a Hospitalfield Scholarship, but left again in 1981 without graduating.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nHis work has encompassed a number of themes. His early works are typified by very masculine working-class men, most famously in The Heroic Dosser (1987). Later, in 1993, he was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum of London, to be the official war artist for the Bosnian War. Here he produced some of his most shocking and controversial work detailing the atrocities which were taking place at the time, like Plum Grove (1994). One painting in particular, Croatian and Muslim, detailing a rape created controversy partly because of its explicit subject matter but also because Howson had painted it from the victims\\' accounts. He was the official war painter at the Kosovo War for the London Times. In 1996 the University of Strathclyde awarded him a Doctor of Letters.\\nIn 1999 he returned to Bosnia both to counter public opinion regarding his earlier comments and to purge his own personal demons encountered on his first visit. The second period affected him deeply, seeing many atrocities.\\n\\nIn more recent years his work has exhibited strong religious themes which some say is linked to the treatment of his alcoholism and drug addiction at the Castle Craig Hospital in Peebles in 2000, after which he converted to Christianity. An example of this is  Judas (2002) which \"...is a key work from the series of paintings conveying the artist\\'s decline into and recovery from alcohol and drug addiction and his new found faith in Christianity.\"\\nHis work has appeared in other media, with his widest exposure arguably for a British postage stamp he did in 1999 to celebrate engineering achievements for the millennium. In addition his work has been used on album covers by Live (Throwing Copper), The Beautiful South (Quench) and Jackie Leven (Fairytales for Hardmen). His work features in major collections including Ben Uri Gallery and Museum, Edinburgh City Art Centre, Glasgow Museums Resource Centre, Ferens Art Gallery, Guildhall Art Gallery, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, High Life Highland Exhibitions Unit, Huntarian Art Gallery, Jerwood Collection, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, National Galleries of Scotland, Nottingham City Museums and Galleries, Rozelle House Galleries, The Dick Institute, Fitzwilliam Museum, The Fleming Collection, Ingram Collection of Modern British Art and The Wilson.\\nHowson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in October 2009 as one of the Queen\\'s Birthday Honours. In November 2010, BBC Scotland aired a documentary named \"The Madness of Peter Howson\" which followed the final stages of the completion of a grand commission for show in the renovated St Andrew\\'s Cathedral and also dealt with Howson\\'s struggle with mental illness and Asperger\\'s syndrome.\\nIn September 2014, Howson suggested he would hand back his OBE, predominantly because of his dislike of British foreign policy but it is not clear if he ever did so.\\nThe film Prophecy, directed by Charlie Paul and produced by Lucy Paul, is an intimate exploration of a single oil painting and the first major film to reveal the motive and techniques behind each stroke of paint Peter Howson creates. With a remarkably acute focus, the film follows the creation of Howson\\'s painting Prophecy, its exhibition and sale, as it travels from the artist\\'s studio in Glasgow to New York, before returning to London to enter the collection of a private buyer.\\nIn May 2023 the Edinburgh City Art Centre gave Howson a major retrospective exhibition of over 100 of his paintings after four years of planning.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nMonographs\\n\\nBerkoff, Stephen, Peter Howson, Flowers (2005)\\nHeller, Robert, Peter Howson, Momentum (2003)\\nJackson, Allan, A Different Man, Mainstream Publishing (1997)\\nHeller, Robert, Peter Howson, Mainstream Publishing (1993)\\nExhibition Catalogues\\n\\nHarrowing of Hell, 24 October - 22 November 2008, Flowers East\\nChristos Aneste, 18 March - 7 May 2005, Flowers East\\nInspired by the Bible, 6–20 August 2004, New College, Edinburgh\\nThe Stations of the Cross, 11 April - 18 May 2003, Flowers East\\nThe Third Step, 13 April - 4 June 2002, Flowers East\\nThe Rake\\'s Progress, 12 January - 11 February 1996, Flowers East\\nBlind Leading the Blind, 9 November- 8 December 1991, Flowers East\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nPeter Howson profile, FlowersGallery.com\\nPeter Howson.net\\nPeter Howson website\\nGlasgow Print Studio (view Howson works on-line)\\nPeter Howson profile,  Asperger-Syndrome.me.uk\\nDonald Kuspit, Bipolar Paintings: PETER HOWSON, THE SCOTTISH BOSCH, artnet.com\\n41 artworks by or after Peter Howson at the Art UK site\\nPeter Howson at National Portrait Gallery, London (npg.org.uk)\\n\"HOWSON, Peter John\".

              "  'Lee Bul (Korean: 이불; 李昢; born 1964) is a South Korean artist who works in various mediums, including performance, sculpture, installation, architecture, printmaking, and media art. Lives and works in Seoul, Lee\\'s work has extended from the late 1980s to the present.\\nAs curators such as Stephanie Rosenthal and art historians such as Yeon Shim Chung have observed, Lee Bul\\'s artwork is shaped by both her social-political context and her personal experiences.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nLee Bul was born on January 25, 1964, in Yeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Raised by politically active parents while her country was under the rule of Park Chung Hee, Lee as a child witnessed a dramatically changing society from its margins, where she and her family repeatedly uprooted and relocated. After receiving B. F. A. in sculpture from Hongik University, Seoul, in 1987, Lee she was briefly involved in the Museum Group, alongside artists such as Choi Jeong Hwa. Although she has figured among \"New Generation\" artists (also called the \"3-8-6\" generation, with the 3 referring to a generation, born in the 1960s, who went to university in the 1980s), the art historian Yeon Shim Chung has argued that Lee\\'s artistic trajectory diverged at an early stage away from the oft-travelled artistic routes of her time.\\nAs Lee embarked on her own independent artistic practice, she pivoted sharply away from the cold, hard materials that founded her training in sculpture (namely, wood, stone, and metal). For her early performances in the 1990s, Yi Bul made sculptural creations made of fabric that connoted fleshy appendages and monstrously fantastical animals—and then wore them, and took to the streets of cities such as Seoul and Tokyo.\\nLee received an initial wave of wide recognition for her Majestic Splendor series (1991), which were installations of decomposing fish decorated with sequins within clear Mylar bags that explored themes of beauty, vulnerability, decay and dread. A prolific material of Korea\\'s textile industry, sequins connoted personal associations for Lee; her mother worked from home to craft bags and other accessories, which surrounded Lee throughout her childhood.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== I Need You (Monument) ===\\nFrom 1996 and 1999, Lee completed three mixed media installations that incorporate photographs of the artist with large scale inflatable forms. One of these installations, titled I Need You (Monument) (1996), features a swelling, phallic object with a photograph of an orientalize and lingerie-clad Lee on the front. Beneath the mass lies an array of pedals for viewers to further aerate the object. Notable is Lee\\'s juxtaposition of title and medium, which contrasts the vulnerability of inflatables with futile attempts to transcend history.\\n\\n\\n=== Majestic Splendor ===\\nA work that has been exhibited globally across multiple iterations, Lee first presented Majestic Splendor in 1991 in Seoul. Majestic Splendor features several real dead fish that are decorated with sequins, beads, and other small, sparkly items. They are placed in plastic bags and pinned to the wall of the gallery in a grid pattern. Over the course of the exhibition, the work emits a putrid odor. In 1997, during the Projects showing at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Majestic Splendor had to be removed because of its stench. After this Lee began using potassium permanganate, which is combustible, to help neutralize the smell.\\n\\n\\n=== Cyborg series ===\\nLee Bul\\'s Cyborg series (1997-2000) was first exhibited at the Artsonje Center in Seoul, Korea in 1998. Its techno-anthropomorphic bodies did not have a distinct biological gender, but seemed to possess female, hourglass shapes. A monster, titled Monster: Black (1998), a pile of excrement with multiple tentacles stands between them, which serves as a seven-foot tidal wave that towers over the sleek figures. Human and machine forms merge to give birth to a third. Female accentuated and idealized forms in ancient Greek culture, sexual charge of Japanese manga. Simultaneously well-proportioned, sensuous, and fragmented, the Cyborg works rose as symbols of human imperfection, despite the biological and cyber nature to transcend physical and mental limitations.  The cyborgs, W1-W4, for instance, are four white figures hang from the ceiling, casting ghostly shadows. The headless, one-armed and one-legged figures are provocatively sexualized, with waists, breasts and buttocks accentuated by the armor-like corsets that don them. Lee has stated, \"There\\'s a very strange, ambivalent mixture of nostalgia for an impossible purity... and a dread of uncontrollable and potentially destructive sexual energy and power sublimated into the forms of machines.”    Merging human and machine boundaries, the cyborg invokes the human experience induced by technological object and artist.\\nLee Bul\\'s cyborgs represent tropes for fear and fascination with \"the uncategorizable, the uncanny,” in her words.  Although her cyborgs stick to a coherent form in Amaryllis (1999), Supernova and Crysallis (2000), they have a disconnect from the viewer for their paradoxical characteristics: “male and female,” “glorious and sinister,” “familiar and alien,” “grotesque and strangely seductive.” \\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nIn 1998, Lee was selected as one of six shortlisted artists, including Huang Yong Ping, William Kentridge, Pipilotti Rist, Lorna Simpson and the eventual winner, Douglas Gordon, for the Hugo Boss Prize.\\nIn 2014, Lee won the Noon Award at Gwangju Biennale.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nLee has had solo exhibitions worldwide including Live Forever which toured the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York and The Power Plant in Toronto. She was selected as a finalist for the 1998 Hugo Boss Prize by the Guggenheim Museum, New York.\\nOther museums that have presented exhibitions of her work include Fondation Cartier, Paris; Domus Artium, Salamanca; Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; Japan Foundation, Tokyo; MAC, Musée d\\'Art Contemporain, Marseille; Le Consortium; Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia; Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland; and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\\nHer two-person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, was titled Projects 57, Bul Lee, Matsui Chie was held in 1996. Bul Lee and Matsui Chie were presented as avant-garde female artists who were using installation art to challenge social norms.\\nIn March 2010, the Hara Museum ARC unveiled a permanent installation by Lee Bul entitled A Fragmentary Anatomy of Every Setting Sun. In February 2012, Tokyo\\'s Mori Art Museum mounted a mid-career survey exhibition, the artist\\'s largest exhibition to date.\\nThe Southbank Centres newly reopened Hayward Gallery hosted a survey of Lee\\'s artists work beginning at the end of May 2018, her first in London; which explores the artist\\'s extensive investigation into the body and its relationship to architectural space. Occupying the entire gallery, this exhibition includes documentation of early performances, sculptural works from the iconic Monster, Cyborg and Anagram series and recent immersive installations, as well as a selection of the artist\\'s studio drawings.\\nIn November 2020, an exhibition of the artist\\'s work opened at St. Petersburg\\'s Manege Central Exhibition Hall, \\'marking a first-time encounter between Lee Bul\\'s works and those by artists of the Russian avant-garde that influenced them.\\'\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) in New York announced in November 2023 that four new sculptures by Lee will be installed at its façade. Titled The Facade Commission: Lee Bul, the commission represents Lee\\'s first major project in the United States since her 2002 solo exhibition at the New Museum.  The works will be on view from 12 September in 2024 to 27 May 2025.\\n\\n\\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\\n\\n*denotes a two-person show\\n\\n\\n== Recognition and awards ==\\n\\n\\n== Market ==\\nLee\\'s works have been broadly exposed in art fairs around the world.

              "  \"Susan Hauptman (1947–2015) was an American artist who worked exclusively on paper with charcoal, pastel, and later, other elements such as gold leaf, wire mesh, and thread. She is best known for her stark, enigmatic, often expressionless self-portraits in which she depicted herself with precise and candid detail. Critics described her works as strikingly androgynous and confrontational toward cultural notions of beauty, reality, femininity, and masculinity. Hauptman's exhibitions were held at several esteemed institutions, including the Norton Gallery of Art, West Palm Beach, FL; the Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Jeremy Stone Gallery. Her works at the Jeremy Stone Gallery further cemented her reputation for challenging traditional gender representations through art.\\nHer later still lifes were of porcelain figures and fruit-box-type labels, fanciful and often romantic. They are thought to be narrative.\\nSusan Hauptman's self is drawn both life-scale and larger-than-life. She draws close to a traditional definition of drawing, where the drawing fundamentals of value, tone, shading, composition and, to a lesser extent, line, are formal elements within each work, modulations of elemental light and shadow. These fundamentals are transformed by her— the artist as alchemist.  Her work transcends its materiality in and as drawing, offering us both the noun and verb of drawing, until we are presented with seemingly autonomous, illusionistic imaginative drawings, moments in an overarching narrative.\\n\\nHauptman's self-portraits offer complex folds, twists and turns in thinking through the inside out of representation, because it is difficult not to be seduced by the astonishing surfaces of the works into believing the illusion of likeness…,or taking for granted the mimetic imaging of the artist beyond the frame… the image and imagined.\\nHer subjective elements, her selves perform endlessly, they constitute the limits of sexual difference…objecthood as a paradox… real against seeming real.\\nHer work is in the collections of numerous of major galleries and museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC, the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Washington D.C., Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville, AR, the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Fl., Arkansas Art Center, Little Rock, AR,  Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, San Francisco, CA, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, CA; Oakland Museum, Oakland, CA, and the Yale University Art Gallery, Richard Brown Baker Collection, New Haven, CT.\\nShe held numerous teaching positions, including the Lamar Dodd Professorial Chair at the University of Georgia from 1997 to 2000.\\nShe was married to Leonard Post, whom she often drew.\\n\\n\\n== Gallery ==\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",

              "  'Neo Rauch (German: [ˈneːo ˈʁaʊx]; born 18 April 1960) is a German artist whose paintings mine the intersection of his personal history with the politics of industrial alienation. His work reflects the influence of socialist realism, and owes a debt to Surrealists Giorgio de Chirico and René Magritte, although Rauch hesitates to align himself with surrealism. He studied at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig, and he lives in Markkleeberg near Leipzig, Germany and works as the principal artist of the New Leipzig School. The artist is represented by Galerie EIGEN + ART Leipzig/Berlin and David Zwirner, New York.\\nRauch\\'s paintings suggest a narrative intent but, as art historian Charlotte Mullins explains, closer scrutiny immediately presents the viewer with enigmas: \"Architectural elements peter out; men in uniform from throughout history intimidate men and women from other centuries; great struggles occur but their reason is never apparent; styles change at a whim.\"\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nRauch\\'s parents died in a train accident when he was four weeks old. His father Hanno Rauch was 21, his mother Helga Wand 19 years old - at the time both of them studied art at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig (Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts). Neo Rauch grew up with his grandparents in Aschersleben and passed his Abitur exam at the Thomas-Müntzer-Oberschule (now Gymnasium Stephaneum). He studied painting at the Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst Leipzig and then was Masterstudent with Professor Arno Rink (1981–1986) and with Professor Bernhard Heisig (1986–1990). After the fall of the GDR Rauch worked from 1993 to 1998 as an assistant to Arno Rink and Sighard Gille at the Leipziger Akademie.\\nIn 2004, he was a selector for EASTinternational with Gerd Harry Lybke.\\nFrom August 2005 until February 2009, he was Professor at the Leipziger Hochschule für Grafik und Buchkunst. Together with Timm Rautert he was curator for the exhibit \"Man muss sich beeilen, wenn man noch etwas sehen will...\" (\"One has to hurry, if one still wants to see something...\") at Gut Selikum in Neuss.\\nRauch works with his spouse and artist Rosa Loy at a former cotton-mill, Leipziger Baumwollspinnerei, about which he says: \"It is the location of concentration and inspiration. Here the best ideas come to me.\" With an estimated fortune of €100 million, he was ranked one of the richest 1,001 individuals and families in Germany by the monthly business publication Manager Magazin in 2017.\\nRauch is the subject of the 2016 film Neo Rauch – Gefährten und Begleiter, directed by Nicola Graef.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\nIn 1991 Neo Rauch had his first solo exhibition in the Leipzig Galerie am Thomaskirchhof. In 1993, the Deputy Director of the Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Rolf Lauter, discovered the artist‘s work and, thanks to the support of the Jürgen Ponto-Stiftung, realized a first non-commercial presentation of his then latest works in the exhibition rooms of Dresdner Bank Frankfurt. In the catalog text, Lauter referred to Rauch‘s combinatorial principle of sampling, incorporating elements from art history, paraphrases of surrealism and metaphors of the banal everyday world. Rauch won the Vincent Award in 2002, which received a corresponding solo show at the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht, The Netherlands, that same year. In 2010, Rauch had his first museum retrospective, which was jointly held at the Museum der bildenden Künste in Leipzig, Germany, and the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany. In 2011, a selection of the works from this retrospective then traveled to the Zachęta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw, Poland. In 2007, the Galerie Rudolfinum in Prague held a retrospective entitled \"Neue Rollen,\" organized by the Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, of Rauch\\'s works covering 13 years.\\nOther solo exhibitions include the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, Montreal, Canada (2006); Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany (2006); Centro de Arte Contemporáneo Málaga, Málaga, Spain (2005); and the Albertina, Vienna, Austria (2004). His work was featured at the 2005 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and he had his first solo North American museum exhibition at the Saint Louis Art Museum in St. Louis, Missouri in 2003-2004.  In 2013, he got his first Belgian solo exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels (Belgium), called Neo Rauch. The Obsession of the Demiurge. Selected Works 1993-2012.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nIn painting \"Characteristic, suggestion and eternity\" are important marks of quality.\\n\\nI view the process of painting as an extraordinarily natural form of discovering the world, almost natural as breathing. Outwardly it is almost entirely without intention. It is predominantly limited to the process of a concentrated flow. I am deliberately neglecting to contemplate all of the catalytic influences that would have the power to undermine the innocence of this approach because I would like to express a degree of clarity in these lines by way of example. I view myself as a kind of peristaltic filtration system in the river of time ...\\nRauch is considered to be part of the New Leipzig School and his works are characterized by a style that depends on the Social Realism of communism. Especially American critics prefer to recognize in his contemporary style a post communist Surrealism. But more than anyone Rauch is recognized as an East-West painter. Rauch merges the modern myths of both the Warsaw Pact and the Western world. His figures are portrayed in a landscape in which an American Comic-Aestheticism meets the Social Realism of communism. In the art publication Texte zur Kunst (Texts about Art, number 55), he was defined as an example for a new German neo-conservatism.\\nIn the US, Roberta Smith, art critic for the New York Times, called attention to Rauch\\'s work in 2002 with an article about the \"painter who came in from the cold.\" In 2007, Rauch painted a series of works especially for a solo exhibition in the mezzanine of the modern art wing at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. This special exhibition was called \"Para.\" Rauch explains that he enjoys the associations the word \"para\" evokes in his own mind, and says that his works at \"Para\" have no particular intention, but that they could signify anything to anyone.\\n\\nWhen I first agreed to do the Met exhibition, I thought about a way of working that would be about the nature of a museum. But straight away I realized that I was much more interested in those \"visions from the Witches Circle\" in my studio than I was in coming up with things in a purely thematic way. Calling them \"visions\" reflects my personality—they precede inspiration and spring from the moment when internal images appear at the prompting of intellectual decisions. I have no choice but to accept everything that I discover in this way.\\n\\n\\n=== Para ===\\n\\nWorks for \"Para\":\\n\\nJagdzimmer (Hunter\\'s room), 2007\\nVater (Father), 2007\\nDie Fuge (The Fugue/The Gap), 2007\\nWarten auf die Barbaren (Waiting for the Barbarians), 2007\\nPara, 2007\\nParanoia, 2007\\nGoldgrube (Gold Mine), 2007\\nVorort (Suburb), 2007\\nDer nächste Zug (The Next Move/The Next Draw), 2007\\nDie Flamme (The Flame), 2007\\nThe works created for \"Para\" are characterized by three elements: a pre-communist civic-mindedness, communist Social Realism, and an idealized countryside. On the other hand, it\\'s a prefix which evokes associations like para-normal, para-dox or  para-noia. It may be read in a system connection, for example a picture like  Paranoia reflects the cognitions theory in a hermetic room.\\nLeipzig, Rauch\\'s city of birth, is known historically as a city of trade through its association with the Leipzig Trade Fair. This civic-mindedness of a trader\\'s city also expressed itself under communism where Leipzig was the center of popular resistance that led to Die Wende. Rauch uses characters and images of life of pre-communist civil society that was oppressed by communism in the GDR. The oppression of communism and the total control of civic life under the rule of communist ideology is one of the elements of Rauch\\'s work. The destructive powers of ideologies is perhaps the reason why Rauch refuses to interpret his own work as a powerful statement in favor of a cultural relativism that characterized the civic bourgeois thought that was destroyed.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nRauch most expensive painting at the art market was Platz ((Square)) (2000), who sold by £1,058,500 ($1,761,231) at Christie\\'s London, on 13 February 2014.\\n\\n\\n== Collections ==\\n\\nWork by the artist is held in public collections, including the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, The Netherlands; Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin, Germany; Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, California; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum der Bildenden Künste Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, Germany; Solomon R.

              "  'Wolfgang Tillmans (born 16 August 1968) is a German photographer. His diverse body of work is distinguished by observation of his surroundings and an ongoing investigation of the photographic medium’s foundations.\\nTillmans was the first photographer, and first non-British person, to be awarded the Turner Prize. He has been the subject of large-scale retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern and Moderna Museet. In 2023, Tillmans was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time. He lives in Berlin and London.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\n\\nTillmans was born in 1968 in Remscheid in the German area of Bergisches Land. At the age of 14 to 16, visits to museums in Düsseldorf and to the Museum Ludwig in Cologne acquainted him with the photo-based art of Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, which counts among his earliest influences. During his first visit to England as an exchange student in 1983, he discovered the British youth culture and the local fashion and music magazines of the time. Also in high school, he became friends with Alexandra Bircken and Lutz Hülle.\\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Tillmans lived in Hamburg; there, in 1988, he had his first solo exhibitions, at Café Gnosa, Fabrik-Foto-Forum, and Front. From 1990 through 1992, he studied at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design (now Arts University Bournemouth) in southern England. \\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nAfter his studies he moved to London and then to New York in 1994 for a year, where he met the German painter Jochen Klein. After moving back to England, Tillmans lived with Klein until Klein died of AIDS-related complications in 1997.\\nFrom 1995, Tillmans primarily lived and worked in London. During the summer of 1998, Tillmans participated in a month-long residency at the last active Shaker community in the world, in Sabbathday Lake, Maine. \\nSince 2007, Tillmans has divided his time between Berlin and London. In Berlin, his studio is located in an annex of a modernist building from the early 1930s, designed by the architect Max Taut.\\n\\n\\n=== Beginnings ===\\n\\nTillmans was initially known for his seemingly casual, sometimes snapshot-like portraits of friends (most notably, fashion designer Lutz Huelle and fellow artist Alexandra Bircken) and other youth in his immediate surroundings and scene. His photos – from the Europride in London (1992) or the Love Parade in Berlin (1992), for example – appeared in magazines such as i-D, Spex, Interview, SZ Magazin and Butt, and established his reputation as a prominent witness of a contemporary social movement. He was made co-editor of Spex in 1997. For the Index Magazine, he shot covers and assignments, including images of John Waters, Gilbert & George, and Udo Kier.\\nTillmans was considered the “documentarian of his generation, especially that of the London club and gay scenes” (though he has said \"It was never my intention to be seen as diaristic or autobiographical. I was not recording the world around me or my tribe or whatever. There is a big misunderstanding there that still persists to this day.\"). Half of his work is staged, with the artist choosing the clothes and the location, as well as setting his models up in their positions. The series of his friends Lutz and Alex, also published in i-D in 1992, are considered important photographic documents of the 1990s. In his early photographs of people, Tillmans portrayed freedom in a different way and he says: \"I wanted to somehow represent what was not being represented elsewhere.\" From 1992 to 1994 Tillmans lived and worked in London, moving to New York in 1994. During this time, he began to show more frequently, developing an exhibition style that consisted of nonhierarchical arrangements of unframed photographs pinned or taped onto the gallery’s walls. Color photographs are placed next to inkjet prints and next to postcards and magazine clippings of his own images, reaching almost to the ceiling and the floor. He views each exhibition as a site-specific installation, often addressing the exhibition space as a larger composition.\\n\\n\\n=== \"Pictures, in order to see the world\" ===\\nTillmans’ photographic practice subsequently developed to encompass a wide array of genres. His portraits, still lifes, sky photographs (e.g. the Concorde series), astrophotography, aerial shots and landscapes are motivated equally by aesthetic and political interests, especially related to homosexuality and gender identity. Tillmans says of his work: “I take pictures, in order to see the world.” He produces images for installations in three sizes, from small to very large, and either in signed, mounted prints, which must be protected in a frame, or as replaceable inkjet prints that can be attached directly to the wall (the latter generated by a certificate-authenticated optical disc). They are installed in meticulous wall installations, sometimes combined with photocopies, and magazine and newspaper clippings (for example, in the installation “Soldiers – The Nineties”); or presented in vitrines, arranged in extensive table-installations (“truth study center”). Operating on the basis of the fundamental equality of all motifs and supports, through this continual re-arranging, repositioning, questioning and reinforcement, Tillmans avoids ascribing any ‘conclusions’ to his work and thus subjects his photographic vision to a perpetual re-contextualization.\\nIn 2009, after Tillmans had been using an analog 50 mm Contax SLR camera almost exclusively for over two decades, he turned to digital photography. In 2012, he abandoned film altogether and became a full-time digital photographer. In an interview that year, he describes the corresponding change from using viewfinders to integrated camera monitors as \"completely turning on its head the psychology of photography, which has always been a dialogue between photographer, object and the imaginary image that one is envisioning, thinking, hoping for.\" According to Tillmans, the higher resolution of digital photographs correlates to \"a transformation in the whole world\"; he further explains: \"In recent years, everything has become HD, so I think it is inevitable that the overwhelming nature of this information density is reflected in my images. In this way, they again describe quite well my sense of perception today.\"\\nWolfgang has a passion and love for the streets and the clubs. Which this two inspire him in his work along with his work in the gay rights movement.(Jobey, 2010).\\n\\n\\n==== Grids ====\\nThe 56 photographs of equal dimensions that make up the Concorde Grid were taken in and around London as part of a commission for Tillmans’ exhibition at Chisenhale Gallery in 1997. Shot from a wide range of places, including private gardens, parks, railway tracks, and the perimeter fence around Heathrow airport, they record the daily passing of the airplane. Total Solar Eclipse Grid (1998), a set of which was included in his Turner Prize installation and is now in the permanent collection of the Tate, documents the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Each of the 21 photographs in the grid was taken during the eclipse of his immediate surroundings in a tropical locale, with varying degrees of light and detail. Snow/Ice Grid (1999) is a grid of images of trampled and melting ice and snow.\\n\\n\\n==== Abstractions ====\\n\\nTillmans exhibited his first abstract and damaged pictures as a Parkett edition in 1998. The edition, 60 unique works on color-negative photographic paper collected by the artist since he began colour printing in 1990, was a combination of true darkroom mistakes and years of darkroom experimentation that they inspired. The Silver works, which Tillmans has been creating since 1998, reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light, as well as mechanical and chemical processes. The name Silver arises from the dirt traces and silver salt stains that remain on the paper when the artist develops the photographs in a machine that is filled with water and has not been completely cleaned.\\nSince 2000, Tillmans has become increasingly interested in the chemical foundations of photographic material, as well as its haptic and spatial possibilities. The \"Conquistador\" series of photographs were the first of these interventions to be exhibited. Later works created directly in the darkroom without the use of a camera, and often largely accidental (e.g. \"Blushes,\" \"Mental Pictures,\" and \"Freischwimmer\"), present photography as a self-referential medium – one that could serve as an experimental ground for the creation of a new type of image structure. These “abstract” works now appear next to the figurative photographs. In \"Blushes,\" fine, thread-like lines, apparently drawn with light, swim over the surface of the photographic paper, and create delicate, fluid patterns.\\nTillmans further explores the bounds of photography as a medium in his “paper drop” series (2001–08). He started to make ‘paper drop’ images depicting photographic paper specifically exposed to coloured light in his darkroom in 2001. He creates extraordinary sculptural forms in photographic paper; then, by photographing them, returns them to the accustomed flatness of that medium. Photography’s step from ‘picture’ to ‘object’ is best demonstrated in the works from the “Lighter” Series (2005–08), in which the artist dropped the act of photographing and allowed the photographs - in their three-dimensional form – to only represent themselves, recalling his ongoing series \"Impossible Color\" (1996–present). These colourful photo-paper works are folded, creased or otherwise manipulated, allowing for a subtle play with the material surface and the resulting illusion of lines and contrast. Contained under plexiglas lids, they have a rather sculptural quality.\\n\\n\\n==== Photocopies ====\\n\\nTillman\\'s first exhibition in 1988 was composed exclusively of images that were created with the latest kind of monochrome laser copier. He regards these so-called Approach pictures (1987–1988) as his \"first work before [he] even owned a camera.\" Over the years, Tillmans has often returned to this medium. The ways that surface structure and image depth influence each other is shown in his large-format works whose original material is analogue photocopies (ongoing since 2006). Here he also references his earlier works from the end of the 1980s that he began in the course of experimenting with an old Canon photocopier.  The uncontrolled contrasts and pigment particles in the images from these old machines are clear only after drastic enlargement (framed ca. 260 x 180 cm). The resulting effects are distanced but also concrete – created through not only the materiality of the printing process but also the play and variation of scale. With the analogue photocopy – probably the most ephemeral form of image (re)production – a system of values for images is brought into a critical light.\\nCommissioned by Tate Modern, Tillmans was on-site throughout the development of the museum\\'s The Tanks galleries from 2012 until 2016, capturing each stage in a series of 176 shots. Turning his lens on building paraphernalia like scaffolding, walkie-talkies and sacks of cement, he manipulated his shots on an old photocopier that produces a single colour image after scanning a picture four times, ‘distorting and shifting the colours so that each one is a unique work’.\\n\\n\\n==== Table works (\"truth study center\") ====\\nIn 2005, at his major supporter Maureen Paley\\'s gallery, Tillmans showed his large-scale display-case installation Truth Study Center. Going even further than his wall-installations, Tillmans’ table works combine a diverse array of image formats and content. His own photographs are presented and arranged under glass next to extracts from books, newspapers, magazines, postcards, packaging and other found materials. The collage-like arrangements of the table displays produce an open-ness and potentiality in terms of aesthetics and content, while raising a critical question about the interpretive possibilities of the visible in a global information-society. With that, claims of absolute (in particular, religious) truth are caricatured, as if Tillmans would like to put them to a kind of test (“truth study center”). The works draw attention to the exercise of power behind the ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism, Catholicism, and capitalism.\\n\\n\\n=== Videos ===\\nIn 1987, Tillmans began making videos, and he has exhibited them since 2002. In most, the camera barely moves, the sound is direct, and the only cuts occur when the camera is turned on and off. Lights (Body) (2000–2002), a video installation featuring static shots of the light effects inside an empty dance club, with the bass pulse of the ‘Hacker Remix\\' of ‘Don\\'t be Light\\' by Air, is the first work by the photographer using the medium of film. The only indications of people on the crowded dance floor are the subtle vibrations and occasionally visible particles of dust. In 2002, Tillmans filmed a video clip for the pop band Pet Shop Boys’ single \"Home and Dry,\" composed almost entirely of shots documenting the mice living in the London Underground system. The film Kopierer (2010) depicts an open color laser copy machine, the CLC 1100, in the act of copying documents over a period of ten minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nIn 2001, Tillmans was awarded first prize in the competition for the design of the AIDS memorial for the City of Munich, whereupon the memorial was erected after his designs at the Sendlinger Tor.\\nIn 2015, Tillmans was commissioned with creating the official portrait of retiring British Museum director Neil MacGregor, which was subsequently acquired by the museum as the first photograph portrait in a tradition stretching back 250 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Music and art collaboration ===\\nIn 2011, Tillmans collaborated with The Opiates by offering a range of photographs to accompany their Hollywood Under the Knife album  and Rainy Days and Remixes EP.\\nA fan of the 1980s experimental synthpop group Colourbox, Tillmans curated an exhibition dedicated to the group, Music of the Band (1982 - 1987), at his Between Bridges gallery in 2014, and also selected the track list and provided original artwork for a tie-in compilation of the same name. The exhibition was the first to be held in the gallery\\'s dedicated Playback Room, where visitors can listen to Tillmans\\' music selections on high-end speakers.\\nIn 2016, Tillmans\\' track \"Device Control\" was included on American singer and rapper Frank Ocean\\'s video album Endless. After Ocean met with Tillmans to discuss the use of his photography for Ocean\\'s studio album Blonde, Tillmans sent Ocean two of his tracks after piquing his interest. Ocean later asked if he could sample the track, to which Tillmans agreed. Although Ocean was initially planning to only sample \"Device Control\", it was released in its entirety as an opening and ending of the video album.\\n\\n\\n=== Between Bridges ===\\nBetween Bridges is a non-profit exhibition space maintained by Tillmans in Berlin.\\nBetween April 2006 and late 2011, Tillmans maintained the exhibition space in the ground floor of his Bethnal Green studio, a former umbrella factory named Moarain House, at 223 Cambridge Heath Road, London. The project\\'s name is taken from a 1999 photograph by the artist, and also refers to the studio\\'s physical location between two rail bridges. The space opened with a show of works by the New York artist and activist David Wojnarowicz. In the small gallery Tillmans developed a program of exhibitions with political art from other artists who he believed had not been given the attention they deserved, specifically in London. Exhibitions were held of work by Jenny Holzer, Wolfgang Breuer, David Wojnarowicz, Corita Kent, Charlotte Posenenske, Isa Genzken, the films of Len Lye, and photographs from the Center for Land Use Interpretation.\\nFrom 2014 to 2019, Between Bridges was based at a former artist studio and gallery in Tiergarten, Berlin. In 2022, it relocated to a six-story corner building Tillmans designed and built in the Kreuzberg district.\\n\\n\\n== Tillmans\\' Experience with AIDS ==\\nTillmans contracted HIV at the age of 26 from his boyfriend Jochen Klein, a German painter and his collaborator on art during most of his life. Klein died from AIDS in 1997. Tillmans stated in his interview with the  SHOWStudio\\'s Lou Stoppard that after experiencing this he feels like life is fragile, and should not take advantage of it.\\nIn the interview with SHOWStudio\\'s Lou Stoppard, Tillmans talks about how some of his artwork has reflected how he felt about HIV and AIDS:\\n\\nTillmans\\' 2014 photograph, \"17 Years\\' Supply\", depicts a giant cardboard box filled with bottles of HIV drugs—some marked with Tillmans\\' own name. His work, as a whole, has also largely spoken to the LGBTQ experience: 2014\\'s \"Arms and Legs\" is an erotic close-up of a male hand slipped underneath another man\\'s red athletic shorts; 2012\\'s \"Juan Pablo & Karl, Chingaza\" features two men smoking and laying [sic] together on a bed of grass.\\nTo accompany an essay by Anthony Fauci, the New York Times asked Tillmans in 2022 to photograph Fauci — his first assignment for the newspaper. In addition to the photographs, the newspaper also published a conversation between Tillmans and Fauci on HIV.\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nWolfgang Tillmans. Cologne: Taschen, 1995, 2002.

In 1995 his work was included at a show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Tillmans\\' work has since been shown in large solo exhibitions at European museums, for example the Kunsthalle Zürich (1995), Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid (1998), Museum Ludwig in Cologne (2001), Castello di Rivoli in Italy (2002), Palais de Tokyo in Paris (2002), the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin (2008), and Serpentine Gallery in London (2010).\\nTate Britain\\'s extensive mid-career retrospective of Tillmans’ work was shown in 2003. In 2006, MoMA PS1 presented Tillmans\\' first exhibition for an American museum. That same year, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles mounted Tillman\\'s first major retrospective in the US, which travelled to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C. His first South American exhibition was shown at the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art in 2012. In 2005 and in 2009, Tillmans was included in the Venice Biennale.\\nIn 2004, the Portikus, Frankfurt, invited Tillmans to curate \"Inventory / Scott King / Donald Urquhart\", an exhibition presenting three artistic positions from London. The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, entrusted Tillmans with the role of a guest curator in 2008, inviting him to present a personal choice of works by Isa Genzken, Roberto Matta, and Ellsworth Kelly from the museum\\'s collection.\\nTillmans carefully designs his exhibitions, in which printed, audiovisual and sometimes textile materials interact with the space they are exhibited in. This preoccupation, together with a rigorous attention to detail (as the pins, clips and tape used for hanging the pictures), has led him to have a dedicated team for setting up his exhibitions. The members of this team are Danish sculptor Anders Clausen, Chilean biologist and architect Federico Martelli (since 2006), and Colombian artist Juan Echeverri (since 2012).\\n\\n\\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\\nKunsthalle Zürich, 1995 (exh. cat.)\\nPortikus, Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1995 (exh. cat.)\\nI Didn\\'t Inhale, Chisenhale Gallery, London, 1997.\\nIsa Genzken, Wolfgang Tillmans, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany, 2001 (exh. cat.)\\nView from Above/Aufsicht, Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany, 2001\\nVue d\\'en Haut, Palais de Tokyo, Paris, 2002; Veduta dall\\'alto, Castle of Rivoli/Museo d\\'Arte Contemporanea, Rivoli, Italy, 2002 (exh. cat.)\\nFrans Hals Museum, Haarlem, Netherlands\\nif one thing matters, everything matters, Tate Britain, London, 2003 (exh. cat.)\\nView From Above, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebœk, Denmark, 2003 (exh. cat.)\\nWolfgang Tillmans, Regen Projects, Los Angeles, 2004\\nFreedom From The Known, MoMA PS1, New York, 2006 (exh. cat.); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington DC, 2007 (exh. cat.); Pinakothek der Moderne (permanent collection), Munich\\nBeugung, Kunstverein München, Munich, 2007\\nLighter, Hamburger Bahnhof Museum fur Gegenwart, Berlin, 2008 (exh. cat.); Museo Tamayo, Mexico City, Mexico\\nSerpentine Gallery, London, 2010 (exh. cat.)\\nModerna Museet, Stockholm, 2012\\nMuseo de Arte del Banco de la República, Bogotá, 2012\\nStedelijk Room, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 2012 (permanent exhibition as part of the collection)\\nNew World, Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York, 2013\\nBook for Architects, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2015\\nYour Body is Yours, National Museum of Art, Osaka, Osaka, 2015\\nPCR, David Zwirner Gallery, New York, 2015\\nWolfgang Tillmans: 2017, Tate Modern, London, 2017.\\nWolfgang Tillmans: Fragile Johannesburg Art Gallery, Johannesburg, 2018\\nWolfgang Tillmans: How likely is it that only I am right in this matter?, David Zwirner, New York\\nWolfgang Tillmans: Today is the first day Wiels, Brussels, 2020\\nSound is Liquid Mumok, Vienna, 2021/22\\nWolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear, Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2022–2023\\nWolfgang Tillmans: To Look Without Fear, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 2023\\n\\n\\n=== Group exhibitions ===\\nManifesta 10, St. Petersburg, Russia, 2014\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\nFollowing a guest professorship at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg from 1998 to 1999 and an Honorary Fellowship at the Arts University Bournemouth in 2001, Tillmans was a professor for Interdisciplinary Art at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main from 2003 to 2006.\\n\\n\\n=== Philanthropic activities ===\\nIn 2011, he travelled to Haiti with the charity Christian Aid to document reconstruction work after the country\\'s devastating earthquake one year before.\\nBetween 2009 and 2014, Tillmans served as an Artist Trustee of the Tate Board.

              "  \"Marlene Dumas (born 3 August 1953) is a South African artist and painter currently based in the Netherlands.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nDumas was born in 1953 in Cape Town, South Africa and grew up in Kuils River in the Western Cape, where her father had a vineyard. Dumas witnessed the system of Apartheid during her childhood. Dumas began painting in 1973 and showed her political concerns and reflections on her identity as a white woman of Afrikaans descent in South Africa. She studied art at the University of Cape Town from 1972 to 1975, and then at Ateliers '63 in Haarlem, which is now located in Amsterdam. She studied psychology at the University of Amsterdam in 1979 and 1980. She currently lives and works in the Netherlands and is one of the country's most prolific artists.\\nDumas has also featured in some films, Miss Interpreted (1997), Alice Neel (2007), Kentridge and Dumas in Conversation (2009), The Future is Now! (2011), and Screwed (2017). Several books included illustrations by Dumas,- Marlene Dumas: Myths and Mortals, Venus and Adonis, David Zwirner: 25 Years, Marlene Dumas: Against the Wall, Marlene Dumas: Sweet Nothings, Marlene Dumas: The Image as Burden, Marlene Dumas: Measuring Your Own Grave, Experiments with Truth: Gandhi and Images of Violence.\\nDumas often uses reference material of polaroid photographs of her friends and lovers, whilst she also references magazines and pornographic material. She also paints portraits of children and erotic scenes to impact the world of contemporary art. She has said that her works are better appreciated as originals since many of her smaller sexual works are very intimate. With many of her paintings she depicts her friends, models, and prominent political figures.\\nDumas paintings are seen as portraits but they do not represent people but an emotional state that one could be in. Her art focuses on more serious issues and themes such as sexuality and race, guilt and innocence, violence and tenderness. Dumas style is more older Romanticism tradition. She uses loose brushstrokes to add distortion but also great detail to her art. Dumas likes to use a wet-on-wet technique, that combines thin layers of paint with thick ones. Her media of choice is oil on canvas and ink on paper. Her subjects range from new born babies, models, strippers, and many figures from popular culture.\\nThe sale of Dumas's Jule-die Vrou (1985), positioned Dumas as one of three living female artists to trade for over $1 million. The sale of The Schoolboys (1986–87) reached $9 million at Art Basel Miami Beach 2023, replacing the high of $6.3 million for her work The Visitor (1995) in 2008.\\nDumas taught at the Academie voor Beeldende Vorming (ABV) in Tilburg, Academie voor Kunst en Industrie (AKI) in Enschede, Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, and De Ateliers in Amsterdam (Tutorials and Coaching).\\nDumas' work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and Dordrechts Museum. Her work was included in the 2022 exhibition Women Painting Women at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.\\n\\n\\n== Education ==\\nDumas was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Antwerp. She also holds degrees from the University of Cape Town, from Ateliers '63 in Haarlem, and the Institute of Psychology, University of Amsterdam.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nSelma Klein Essink, Marcel Vos and Jan Debbaut, Miss Interpreted, exhibition catalogue, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, 1992\\nJonathan Hutchinson, Chlorosis, exhibition catalogue, The Dougles Hyde Gallery, Dublin, 1994\\nCatherine Kinley, Marlene Dumas, exhibition broadsheet, Tate Gallery, London, 1996\\nGianni Romano, Suspect, Skira, Milan, 2003\\nCornelia Butler, Marlene Dumas: painter as witness, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 2008\\nIlaria Bonacossa, Dominic van den Boogerd, Barbara Bloom and Mariuccia Casadio, Marlene Dumas, Phaidon Press, London, 2009\\nNeal Benezra and Olga M.

              "  'Robert Goodnough (October 23, 1917 – October 2, 2010) was an American abstract expressionist painter. A veteran of World War II, Goodnough was one of the last of the original generation of the New York School; (although he has been referred to as a member of the \"second generation\" of Abstract Expressionists), even though he began exhibiting his work in galleries in New York City in the early 1950s. Robert Goodnough was among the 24 artists from the total of 256 participants who were included in the famous 9th Street Art Exhibition, (1951) and in all the following New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals from 1953 to 1957. These Annuals were important because the participants were chosen by the artists themselves. Early in his career starting in 1950 he showed his paintings at the Wittenborn Gallery, NYC. He had shown at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York City from 1952 to 1970  and again from 1984 to 1986. In 1960 and 1961 he had solo exhibitions at The Art Institute of Chicago. A veteran of scores of solo exhibitions and hundreds of group exhibitions in the United States and abroad, Goodnough also had solo exhibitions in 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in NYC and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. A major work by Goodnough is included in The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY. In later years his paintings were also associated with the Color Field movement.\\nDuring the 1940s Goodnough graduated from Syracuse University and served in the U. S. Army during World War II. After the war in 1946 he attended the Ozenfant School of Fine Arts in New York and the Hans Hofmann summer school in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He earned his master\\'s degree from New York University in 1950 after which he began to exhibit his paintings publicly and also to write articles for ARTnews magazine.\\nIn 1992 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nMartin H.

              "  'Patricia Cronin (born in 1963 in Beverly, Massachusetts)  is a New York-based feminist cross-disciplinary artist. Since the early-1990s, Cronin has garnered international attention for her photographs, paintings and sculptures that address contemporary human rights issues. Cronin\\'s conceptual artistic practice transits across many aesthetic platforms addressing social justice issues of gender, sexuality and class, including: lesbian visibility, feminist art history, marriage equality and international rights of women and LGBTQ+ people. She subverts traditional art images and forms in a wide range of two and three-dimensional time-honored artists\\' materials and breathes new life into these images and forms by injecting her specific political content. Her critically acclaimed statue, \"Memorial To A Marriage\", is the first and only Marriage Equality monument in the world. A 3-ton Carrara marble mortuary sculpture of her life partner and herself was made before gay marriage was legal in the U.S., and has been exhibited widely across the country and abroad. Cronin began her career working for the Anne Frank Stichting (Foundation) Archived 2015-10-25 at the Wayback Machine in Amsterdam installing the traveling exhibition \"Anne Frank in the World\" in Europe and the U.S. Giving presence to female absence is a consistent thread that runs through and connects each body of work.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nCronin received her BFA from the Rhode Island College in 1986 and received an MFA from Brooklyn College in 1988 where she studied with Lee Bontecou, Allan D\\'Arcangelo, Lois Dodd, Philip Pearlstein, and William T. Williams. Cronin also studied at the Yale University Summer School of Music and Art, Norfolk Fellowship Program in 1985 and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1991.\\nCronin has had solo exhibitions at the American Academy in Rome, Musei Capitolini, Centrale Montemartini Museo, Rome, Italy, the Brooklyn Museum, Deitch Projects, and Brent Sikkema (now Sikkema Jenkins & Co.). Two survey exhibitions of her work have been organized; Patricia Cronin, The Domain of Perfect Affection, 1993 to 2003, UB Art Gallery, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY and Patricia Cronin, All Is Not Lost, 2000–2009, Newcomb Art Museum, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA which was supported by [1] The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.\\nCronin\\'s work is in the permanent collections of the National Gallery of Art, Corcoran Collection and Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery Archived 2016-06-24 at the Wayback Machine, both in Washington, DC, Deutsche Bank, New York, NY, Perez Art Museum Miami, Miami, FL, The Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, both in Glasgow, Scotland.\\nCronin is the recipient of numerous awards and grants, including the Rome Prize Fellowship in Visual Art from the American Academy in Rome, Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant, two Pollock-Krasner Foundation grants, Anonymous Was A Woman Foundation Award and the Civitella Ranieri Foundation Fellowship. Cronin has served as a Trustee on the Boards of the American Academy in Rome and the Civitella Ranieri Foundation. A frequent juror of numerous arts organizations, she has also chaired and served on the College Art Association\\'s Artist\\'s Lifetime Achievement Award.\\nCronin has lectured extensively at many U.S. and international museums, including: the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, United Kingdom; Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, Scotland, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Brooklyn Museum, Christie\\'s, New York, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Washington, DC, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy. In 1994 she organized the panel \"Lesbian Subjectivities\" at The Drawing Center, New York, NY and guest edited the corresponding issue of Art Papers.\\nShe has taught at many art schools and in the Graduate Art Programs at both Columbia University and Yale University. Since 2003 she has been a professor of art at Brooklyn College of The City University of New York, including Claire and Leonard Tow Professorships (2013-14) (2018-2020). In July 2023 The City University of New York Board of Trustees appointed Cronin to Distinguished Professor of Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Erotic Polaroids and watercolors (1992–1999) ===\\nIn these early works that blend performance and documentation, Cronin depicts the subject of explicit female sexuality in a way that both extends and critiques the role of sexuality throughout art\\'s history. Curator Sandra Firmin observed, \"in contrast to her contemporary, photographer Catherine Opie, who received critical acclaim for her dignified studio portraiture of queer leather communities in California, Cronin\\'s snapshots are taken in the frenzy of participation. Emerging concurrently in the early 1990s, both Cronin and Opie offer a lesbian counterpart to Robert Mapplethorpe\\'s controversial X Portfolio from the late 1970s and early 1980s, which filtered multiracial sex acts and sadomasochism through a highly disciplined language of formal photography, merging homoerotic pornography and high art in the process.\" These works give voice to a particular experience (that of Cronin herself, whose vantage point as a participant is purposefully utilized throughout the work) while simultaneously speaking to larger questions regarding queer, lesbian or feminist subjectivities and the extent to which they are truly or accurately articulated and represented in artistic practice at large.\\nBoys and Girls from the Erotic Polaroid series were part of the exhibition Coming To Power: 25 Years of Sexually X-plicit Art by Women, which pays homage to the first generation of women artists who pioneered a new artistic genre in the mid-1960s and early 1970s using explicit sexual imagery and also presents the work of a younger generation of female artists that elicit sexual excitement as well as express autonomous pleasure, passion and pain. The exhibition was conceived by Cronin and fellow artist, Ellen Cantor, during their time at Skowhegan School of Art in the summer of 1991 and their curatorial collaboration including studio visits, venue meetings and fundraising efforts on the project continued through 1993. Due to a disagreement with Cantor over a #metoo incident Cronin had with a museum director, she walked away from the project and their exhibition was presented a few months later at  David Zwirner Gallery Archived 2016-09-17 at the Wayback Machine listing Cantor as the sole curator.\\n\\n\\n=== Pony Tales and Tack Room (1996–1998) ===\\nCronin uses the \"equestrian lifestyle\" as a lens through which to see sexuality and class. In Pony Tales, Cronin interrogated the boundaries and possibilities of portraiture by focusing on a non-human subject, horses. Drawing inspiration from her own fascination with the species, as well as the popular literature and cult surrounding them, Cronin painted individual equestrian portraits that speak to how cultural fascination and fetishization create social values.  Framed in walnut and installed on Schumacher\\'s \"Summer Country Archive\" wallpaper, this body of work debuted at Sikkema Gallery, and was also shown at Real Art Ways, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and UB Art Gallery at SUNY Buffalo.\\nAlong with these portraits, an upper class equestrian socio-economic meilleure blending real estate and subversive female empowerment also inspired Tack Room (1997–98), an architectural environment where Cronin built a life-size stable complete with all the equestrian accouterments including: saddles, bridles, equestrian clothing, blankets, training books, first aid and art.  After closer viewing, the smell of leather and hay permeates the installation and suede chaps, leather bridles and metal bits, whips and paddles accumulated suggest a more sexual reading and open up Cronin\\'s fantasy of what an architectural space where female sexuality isn\\'t ridiculed, but rather celebrated could look like. The work was exhibited at White Columns (1998) and was one of the top ten shows of 1998 by art critic Lisa Liebmann in Artforum. It was also presented at The Armory Show (2017) in the curated section of large installations, Platform, curated by Eric Shiner and was shown again in \"Horses?\" exhibition at Chart gallery in Tribeca (July 9 - September, 2021).\\n\\n\\n=== Luxury real estate paintings (2000–2001) ===\\nContinuing her interest in how cultural meaning is enshrined and propagated, Cronin turned her attention to the real estate market. This series depicts lavish, expansive and expensive homes and estates titled with the price and location of each estate (i.e., \"$10,000,000 (Southampton)\"). These small-scaled works, no larger than nine by fifteen inches, recall intimate real estate listings that ironically belie the actual expansion of the houses they advertise. Cronin used listings in Sotheby\\'s International Realty  as her source material, a conscious choice that raises questions about class and its relationship to fine art markets, controlled and regulated by auction houses like Sotheby\\'s. The works were shown at Cronin\\'s solo survey exhibition The Domain of Perfect Affection: 1993–2003 at the University at Buffalo Art Gallery in 2004 and in Looking At America exhibition at the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT, in 2002.\\n\\n\\n=== Memorial To A Marriage (2002) ===\\nTo address the lack of women represented in public monuments and same sex marriage being illegal Cronin created Memorial To A Marriage, the first Marriage Equality monument in the world. In 2001, the Kansas City-based arts organization Grand Arts awarded Cronin an Artist\\'s Project Grant to create Memorial To A Marriage, a three-ton Carrara marble mortuary statue of Cronin and her partner, the artist, Deborah Kass. The two women, a lesbian couple, depicted recumbent in an entwined embrace on a bed. As Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston former chief curator Helen Molesworth writes, the work \"traffics in love and death, and in the intimate relations between these two structuring poles of human existence.\" Utilizing a patriotic form, American Neo-classical sculpture, to address a federal failure (the prohibition of gay marriage), Memorial to a Marriage balances visual poetry with political protest. Although now legal, marriage equality remains an extremely contentious political and social issue in the United States.\\nCompleted in 2002 when gay marriage was illegal in the U.S., the only legal protections available to gay and lesbian couples were about death: wills and health care proxies. Cronin created the marble mortuary statue of the two lovers, a decade before the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act in 2012. The art historian Robert Rosenblum described the work as \"so imaginative a leap into an artist\\'s personal life and so revolutionary a monument in terms of social history that it demands a full scale monograph.\" He named the installation as one of the ten best shows of 2003 in Art Forum.\\nWith the help of Deitch Projects, Cronin purchased and installed the marble sculpture in 2002 on the couple\\'s actual personal burial plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, NY, a National Historic Landmark. Woodlawn was designed in 1863 as America\\'s Père Lachaise Cemetery and is one of the best examples of the nineteenth-century garden cemetery movement. It is the resting place for many historic figures including artists, writers, civic leaders, entrepreneurs, great entertainers and jazz musicians everyone from Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Madame C. J. Walker, J.P. Morgan, Joseph Pulitzer, to Herman Melville and numerous mausoleums designed by architects McKim, Mead & White and John Russell Pope with Louis Comfort Tiffany and John LaFarge stained glass windows.\\nMemorial to a Marriage has been included in over 40 exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad, including the Brooklyn Museum, Palmer Museum of Art, Neuberger Museum of Art, Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, The FLAG Art Foundation, New York, Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, Scotland and the American Academy in Rome, Rome, Italy. It is in several museum permanent collections, including Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, Washington, DC, Perez Art Museum Miami, Miami, FL and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, Scotland where it is on permanent view.  Memorial to a Marriage has been written about extensively in many publications and also the subject in two Ph.D. dissertations as well as in and on the cover of Routledge\\'s \"Museums, Equality and Social Justice\" book.\\nIn 2022, Memorial To A Marriage, became the centerpiece in the world\\'s first VR LGBTQ+ Museum debuting at the Tribeca Film Festival and winning the prestigious New Voices Award in the Immersive Competition.\\nNovember 3, 2022 marked the 20th anniversary of the statue\\'s unveiling and was commemorated at Woodlawn Cemetery with historic tours, talks at the site and a symposium at the Woolworth Chapel with art historians Maura Reilly, Ph.D., Director of the Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers\\nUniversity and Harriet F. Senie, Ph.D., professor emerita City College and Graduate Center, CUNY.\\n\\n\\n=== Harriet Hosmer: Lost and Found (2009) ===\\nCronin won the Rome Prize for her series on Harriet Hosmer, an American expatriate who moved to Rome in 1852 and subsequently became known as the first professional woman sculptor   The result of her research that year was the production of a catalogue raisonné for which Cronin took on the roles of historian, artist and curator as she herself compiled art historical research on Hosmer, illustrated the book with her own watercolors and wrote descriptions of each work.\\nAs Maura Reilly, founding curator of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, writes,  Cronin\\'s complex role as an artist raises questions such as \"in choosing a female artist, one who was famous in her day yet relatively unknown today, Cronin\\'s deconstructivist project diverges from her previous interventionist project, Memorial To A Marriage. With the Hosmer project she is highlighting instead the canon of art history\\'s exclusions and inclusions, thereby figuring forth its discriminatory practices and sexist foundations that make it acceptable for certain artists – male – to be raised to the canon\\'s heights and others not.\"\\nThe catalogue combines hand painted images with art historical research to create a document that reveals the complexities of Hosmer\\'s career, reputation, and legacy.  Hosmer moved to Rome in 1852 and lived among a community of British and American artists and writers and a circle of learned and well-to-do \"independent women.\" Hosmer had an important career, was praised by critics, won competitive commissions, and earned enormous sums for her sculptures. In this unique catalogue, Cronin pieces together a conceptual framework to examine the histories of art and women at the intersection of the ivory tower and the marketplace.\\nThis is particularly evident in Cronin\\'s handling of the works for which visual images do not exist. In these cases, in place of a physical likeness, Cronin depicts what art historian Alexander Nemerov describes as ghosts and Cronin herself calls \"phantoms.\" In these moments of absence the viewer is made aware of the built in impossibility of the project which, with these watercolors, become part of its subject and thus speaks directly to the legacy of feminist art and its implication in contemporary artistic practice.\\nThe work was exhibited at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum in 2009–10. Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Pulitzer Prize winning art critic Holland Cotter wrote, \"In short, Ms. Cronin\\'s Hosmer show  –  organized by Lauren Ross, interim curator of the Sackler Center  –  is a complex package: a total work of art that is also a historical document of the careers of two artists, past and present, and a salvage operation to secure the visibility of both artists over time.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Dante: The Way of All Flesh (2012) ===\\nCronin\\'s ongoing relationship to Italian art history and literature has continued past her Rome Prize year at the American Academy in Rome. Looking at the global financial crisis and conflict areas, Cronin felt a need for a new humanism, which she has integrated into her artistic practice. Cronin turned to Dante Alighieri\\'s Inferno as a point of departure for a series of expressive figurative oil paintings, watercolors and bleach portraits of corrupt politicians and religious leaders. The series shows her expanding on recurring themes – whose life has value and who decides, church or state – while simultaneously drawing on the classic work to elaborate on Dante\\'s allegorical timeless story of a cautionary tale largely gone unheeded. Elizabeth Kley writes in ARTnews, \"Untitled (2012) is a 16-part grid of watercolors created by bleaching red and orange paper. Inspired by Dante\\'s lineup of named Renaissance malefactors, they are portraits of contemporary power mongers who\\'ve committed the sins that Cronin (and Dante) consider most heinous; fraud, treachery, and betrayal.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Le Macchine, Gli Dei e I Fantasmi (2013) ===\\nFor her 2013 exhibition (Machines, Gods and Ghosts), Cronin was the first contemporary artist invited to use the historic venue at the Musei Capitolini\\'s converted powerplant Centrale Montemartini Museo Archived 2016-08-15 at the Wayback Machine in Rome and re-conceptualize many of the concerns of her earlier work. Curated by Ludovico Pratesi, conceived specifically for the museum\\'s Engine Room, this industrial archaeology commingled with the Capitoline Museums\\' Classical sculpture collection and the \"phantoms\" or \"ghosts\" from Cronin\\'s Hosmer project. Using a 21st-century printing technique, dye sublimation enlarged on silk, these panels hung throughout the space slowly undulating, these new pieces further highlight the evocative juxtaposition of anachronic pairings of classical sculptures and their modern surroundings and in their contrasting materiality and formalism, underscore questions of absence and omission as they relate to the history, art and civilization including the anonymous artists that carved the Classical marble sculptures and the anonymous missed workers who are no longer employed at the power plant. If Cronin\\'s work on Harriet Hosmer asked the important question of who and what gets remembered in Art History, then this newest project stresses how contemporary art might also be utilized to ask this same question. The show was accompanied by a catalogue, published by Silvana Editoriale, with essays in both Italian and English written by Peter Benson Miller and Ludovico Pratesi.\\n\\n\\n=== Shrine for Girls, Venice (2015) ===\\nShrine for Girls, Venice is a solo Collateral Event of the 56th International Art Exhibition – la Biennale di Venezia 2015 (May 5 - November 22, 2015). Inside the sixteenth-century Church of San Gallo, this dramatic site-specific installation focuses on the global plight of women and girls, often facing violence, repression and forced ignorance, and is a shrine in their honor. Shrines, part of every major religion\\'s practice, provide a space for contemplation, petition and rituals of remembrance. Here, Cronin gathered hundreds of girls\\' humble clothes from around the world to reference specific tragic events in India and Nigeria, as well as, the United Kingdom and the United States, and arranged them on three stone altars to act as relics of these young martyrs. Juxtaposing brightly colored saris like those worn by gang raped and murdered girls in India, muted palettes of hijabs worn by the students kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria and ghost-like values of aprons from the Magdalene Laundries in the UK and US with the richness of the marble and wood paneled church interior opens up a space for refuge and reflection in the face of human tragedy. Shrine for Girls, Venice proposes a new dialogue between gender, memory and justice. Julie Belcove writes in the Financial Times, \"The pared-down presentation demands quiet reflection, and the piece\\'s emotional power, Cronin hopes, will derive from viewers\\' intuitive comprehension of what is absent.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Shrine for Girls, International Tour (2016–2022) ===\\n\\n\\n=== Shrine for Girls, New York (2016) ===\\nAfter the Venice presentation, Shrine for Girls began an international tour at The FLAG Art Foundation [2], New York (June 9 – August 12, 2016). \"Moving from the marble altars and sacred architecture of Venice\\'s sixteenth-century Chiesa di San Gallo to the secular gallery context of FLAG, Cronin will present the same three fabric sculptures, here piled on top of their shipping crates to now address human trafficking as well as human rights issues. The installation of clothing, of what the missing bodies would have inhabited, provokes an emotional and visceral response to what is absent. Small photographs of each tragedy accompany the sculptures and provide very real context for the work. A new series of watercolor portraits place a human face on tragedy and amplify the \\'identifiable victim effect,\\' drawing our attention away from statistics to the magnitude of the individual loss and unrealized human potential.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Shrine for Girls, Dublin (2017) ===\\nIn June 2017 Shrine for Girls then traveled to Ireland, curated by Sheena Barrett at The LAB Gallery in Dublin (June 16 - August 20, 2017). The gallery is notably around the corner from the last Magdalene Laundry to close, [3] the subject of one of the fabric sculptures. Moving from the sacred to secular architecture the work courses within the architecture of the powerful providing a stark contrast with her subjects, the powerless. Three oil portraits of a girl from each tragedy was exhibited in an intimate gallery away from the altars.\\n\\n\\n=== Shrine for Girls, Utrecht (2021-2022) ===\\nThe Shrine For Girls (United Kingdom) \"altar\" and portrait painting, Magdalene Laundry Girl, is included in the Mary Magdalene exhibition at Museum Catherijne Convent, Utrecht, The Netherlands (June 24, 2021 - January 9, 2022) curated by Dr. Lieke Wijnia, exploring the many interpretations of Mary Magdalene from the Middle Ages to Today with Cronin, Kiki Smith and Marlene Dumas.\\n\\n\\n=== Aphrodite: Reimagined, (2018) ===\\n\"Aphrodite Reimagined,\" is a 10-foot monumental sculpture commissioned for the exhibition Patricia Cronin, Aphrodite, and the Lure of Antiquity: Conversations with the Collection, at the Tampa Museum of Art. It is the inaugural exhibition (August 16, 2018 - January 6, 2019) in a biennial series, Conversations with the Collection exploring synergy between the museum\\'s collection of antiquities and modern and contemporary work. Aphrodite, Reimagined is the artist\\'s vision of the goddess Aphrodite, inspired by a fragment of a marble torso from 1st century AD in the museum\\'s collection. Recreated on an Ancient Cult statue monumental scale in cold-cast marble, the torso now has a head, arms, and legs hand modeled and cast in resin the pale shade of aquamarine blue green, like beach glass. Mimicking the drapery and posture of the original statue, Cronin\\'s version reads as both ancient and modern simultaneously, allowing contemporary viewers to gaze upward at the classical figure, a female authority in public, just as ancient audiences once did in columned-filled temples. \"History is never going to be finished, said Cronin. \"We have to evaluate the past and help us find our way to the future.\" Also included in the exhibition are a new series of multi-layered assemblage paintings and glass sculpture. It marks the first time the artist has ever worked in resin and glass.\\nThe Tampa Museum of Art announced their acquisition of Aphrodite Reimagined into their permanent collection on March 24, 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Notable exhibitions ==\\n2018 Patricia Cronin, Aphrodite and the Lure of Antiquity, Tampa Museum of Art, Tampa, FL\\n2017 Shrine for Girls, Dublin, The LAB Gallery, Dublin, Ireland\\n2016 Shrine for Girls, New York, The FLAG Art Foundation Archived 2016-07-01 at the Wayback Machine, New York, NY\\n2015 Shrine for Girls, Venice, Collateral Event of the 56th International Art Exhibition – la Biennale di Venezia, Chiesa di San Gallo, Venice, Italy (curated by Ludovico Pratesi) (catalogue)\\n2013 Le Macchine, Gli Dei e I Fantasmi, Musei Capitolini, Centrale Montemartini Museo Archived 2013-08-29 at the Wayback Machine, Rome, Italy (curated by Ludovico Pratesi) (catalogue)\\n2012 Dante: The Way of All Flesh, Ford Project, New York, NY\\n2012 Patricia Cronin: All Is Not Lost (2000-2009), Newcomb Art Museum, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA  (catalogue)\\n2009–10 Patricia Cronin: Harriet Hosmer, Lost and Found, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY  (catalogue)\\n2007 An American in Rome, American Academy in Rome Art Gallery, Rome, Italy\\n2004 Patricia Cronin, The Domain of Perfect Affection, 1993 to 2003, UB Art Gallery, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY (catalogue)\\n2002 Memorial To A Marriage, Deitch Projects, New York, NY\\n1998 Tack Room, White Columns, New York, NY\\n1997 Pony Tales, Brent Sikkema, New York, NY\\n\\n\\n== Books and films about Cronin ==\\nMarilyn Stokstad and Michael Cothren, Art A Brief History, 7th edition, London: Pearson Educational/Prentice Hall, 2018\\nMarilyn Stokstad and Michael Cothren, Art History, 6th edition, London: Pearson Educational/Prentice Hall, 2017\\nPatricia Cronin: Social Justice and Aesthetic Responsibilities NYU Florence, April 2017\\nPratesi, Ludovico, Phong Bui and Maura Reilly, Patricia Cronin, Shrine For Girls, Venice, exhibition catalogue, Chiesa di San Gallo, 56th International Art Exhibition - la Biennale di Venezia 2015, Silvana Editoriale, Milan, 2015\\nA Silent Protest Can Be Quite Powerful Studio International, 2015\\nPratesi, Ludovico and Peter Benson Miller, Patricia Cronin: Le Macchine, Gli Dei e I Fantasmi, exhibition catalogue, Musei Capitolini, Centrale Montemartini Museo, Silvana Editoriale, Milano, 2013\\nCronin, Patricia, The Zenobia Scandal: A Meditation on Male Jealousy, Zing Books, New York, NY, 2013\\nSandell, Richard and Eithne Nightingale, eds., Museums, Equality and Social Justice, Routledge, 2012\\nMolesworth, Helen and Alexander Nemerov, Patricia Cronin: All Is Not Lost , exhibition catalogue, Newcomb Art Gallery, Tulane University, New Orleans, 2012\\nCronin, Patricia, preface by Maura Reilly and an essay by William H.

              "  'Paul Thek (November 2, 1933 – August 10, 1988) was an American painter, sculptor and installation artist. Thek was active in both the United States and Europe, exhibiting several installations and sculptural works over the course of his life. Posthumously, he has been widely exhibited throughout the United States and Europe, and his work is held in numerous collections including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, and Kolumba, the Art Museum of the Archdiocese of Cologne.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nThek (born George Thek) was the second of four children born to parents of German and Irish ancestry in Brooklyn. In 1950, Thek studied at the Art Students League of New York as well as Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, before entering the School of Art at the Cooper Union in New York in 1951. Upon graduating in 1954, he moved to Miami, where he met and became involved with set designer Peter Harvey, who introduced Thek to a number of artists and writers such as Tennessee Williams. During this time, Thek created some of his first known drawings, including studies in charcoal and graphite (now held in Kolumba\\'s collections), later followed by abstract watercolors and oil paintings. Thek first referred to himself as Paul Thek starting in 1955; in a letter to Harvey, he writes: \"Let me tell you who I am George Joseph Thek but Paul to you and Paul to me you would have to be me to know why I am Paul after all this erroneous George business.\" In 1957, he exhibited his works for the first time at Mirrell Gallery in Miami. It was in Florida that Thek first met photographer Peter Hujar, who photographed Thek in Coral Gables.\\nBy the end of 1959, Thek and Hujar, now a couple, were living in New York. Thek traveled to Italy in 1962, and with Hujar visited the Catacombs of the Capuchins in Palermo, an experience which had a strong influence on his work.\\nDuring the 1960s, Thek and Hujar associated with a number of artists and writers including Joseph Raffaele, Eva Hesse, Gene Swenson, and Susan Sontag. Thek was particularly close to Sontag, who dedicated her 1966 collection of essays, Against Interpretation, to him. According to Sontag\\'s biographer, the title and inspiration for the eponymous essay came from Thek. One day when Sontag was \"talking about art in a cerebral way that many complained was a bore,\" he interrupted: \"Susan, stop, stop. I\\'m against interpretation. We don\\'t look at art when we interpret it. That\\'s not the way to look at art.\"\\nIn 1964, he participated in Andy Warhol\\'s Screen Tests. It was during this time that he began to work in installation and sculpture, most notably creating wax sculptures made in the likeness of meat. Between 1964 and 1967, Thek had three solo exhibitions of his famed Technological Reliquaries at Stable Gallery and Pace Gallery in New York.\\nThek was awarded a Fulbright fellowship in 1967 to Italy, leaving New York shortly after his exhibition for The Tomb opened. The figure in Thek\\'s Tomb was popularly associated with the American hippie movement and has often been mistitled as Death of a Hippie. He traveled and lived throughout Europe during the late 1960s and early 1970s and worked on large scale installations.\\nAfter a peripatetic lifestyle, Thek took up permanent residence in New York in 1976 and began teaching at Cooper Union.  Amid increasing emotional stress, he struggled to make and sell work, but began to show nationally and internationally again during the 1980s. He died on August 10, 1988, after learning he had AIDS the year prior. After his death, Sontag dedicated AIDS and Its Metaphors to his memory.\\nIn 2010, the Whitney Museum of American Art exhibited the first American retrospective of Thek\\'s work with Diver, a Retrospective. Works of Paul Thek are on permanent display at The Watermill Center on Long Island, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Notable works ==\\n\\nTechnological Reliquaries, or Meat Pieces (1964–67) is among Thek\\'s most notable body of works, wax sculptures made in the likeness of raw meat and human limbs encased in Plexiglas vitrines. In a 1966 interview, he speaks of the work: “I hope the work has the innocence of those Baroque Crypts in Sicily; their initial effect is so stunning you fall back for a moment and then it\\'s exhilarating…It delighted me that bodies could be used to decorate a room, like flowers. We accept our thing-ness intellectually but the emotional acceptance of it can be a joy.”\\nThe Tomb (1967), perhaps his most famous work, was a pink ziggurat which encased an effigy of Thek made from a mannequin with face, hands, and feet cast from his own body. Painted in a light pink, the effigy featured a protruding tongue and a hand bloodied from amputation, and was surrounded by other casts of Thek\\'s body in cases roped off with red cords in reference to archeological digs.\\nThe Procession/The Artist\\'s Co-op (1969, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam), Pyramid/A Work in Progress (1971–72, Moderna Museet, Stockholm), Ark, Pyramid (1972, documenta 5, Kassel), and Ark, Pyramid, Easter (1973, Kunstmuseum Luzern) were a series of conceptually-related installations created with a number of collaborators during Thek\\'s time in Europe. Each contained common elements which served to create an immersive environment, including: the “Hippie” (a cast of Thek\\'s body), the Dwarf Parade Table (a table supported by a latex statue of a dwarf and chairs), and a chicken coop. With each installation came an increasing number of items compromising the pieces, to the point at which much of Ark, Pyramid, Easter had to be destroyed as Kunstmuseum Luzern could no longer store the components.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Selected solo exhibitions ===\\n2022: Paul Thek: Italian Hours, Fondazione Nicola del Roscio, Rome, Italy\\n2021: Paul Thek: Relativity Clock, Alexander and Bonin, New York\\n2021: Paul Thek: Interior/Landscape, The Watermill Center, Water Mill, New York\\n2015: Ponza and Roma, Alexander and Bonin, New York; Mai 36 Galerie, Zürich\\n2015: Please Write!

              "  'Anya Gallaccio (born 1963) is a British artist, who creates site-specific, minimalist installations and often works with organic matter (including chocolate, sugar, flowers and ice).\\nHer use of organic materials results in natural processes of transformation and decay, meaning that Gallaccio is unable to predict the result of her installations. Something which at the start of an exhibition may be pleasurable, such as the scent of flowers or chocolate, would inevitably become increasingly unpleasant over time. The timely and site-specific nature of her work makes it notoriously difficult to document. Her work therefore challenges the traditional notion that an art object or sculpture should essentially be a monument within a museum or gallery. Instead her work often lives through the memory of those that saw and experienced it – or the concept of the artwork itself.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nBorn in Paisley, Scotland, to TV producer George Gallaccio and actress Maureen Morris. She grew up in south west London, England and studied at Kingston Polytechnic (1984–85) and Goldsmiths College (1985–88). In 1988 Gallaccio exhibited in the Damien Hirst-curated Freeze exhibition, and in 1990 the Henry Bond and Sarah Lucas organised East Country Yard shows, which brought together many of the Young British Artists. Gallaccio is a professor in the Department of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\nGallaccio is known for producing site-specific works that inhale the prescribed climate and space. She often collaborates closely with nature when selecting materials, exploring life cycles through the passage of time, memory, and loss. Much of her work uses organic materials, with fruit, vegetables and flowers all featuring in her work. Sometimes these materials undergo a change during the course of being exhibited.\\nIn Red on Green (1992), her first solo showing at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, ten thousand rose heads placed on a bed of their stalks gradually withered as the exhibition went on. For Intensities and Surfaces (1996) Gallaccio left a thirty-two ton block of ice with a salt core in the disused pumping station at Wapping and allowed it to melt.\\npreserve \\'beauty\\'  1991–2003 was an artwork which Gallaccio produced as a nominee for the 2003 Turner Prize. The installation consisted of a wall of gerbera daisies pinned behind a single sheet of glass. Behind glass, the flowers recall still-life and romantic landscape paintings, as well as flower arranging and pressing.\\nOther works by Gallaccio include Stroke (1993) in which benches in the gallery and cardboard panels attached to the walls were covered in chocolate, \\n\"Two Hundred Kilos of Apples Tied to a Barren Apple Tree\", Atelier Amden, Amden, Switzerland (1999) and Because Nothing has Changed (2000), a bronze sculpture of a tree adorned with porcelain apples. Because I Could Not Stop (2002) is a similar bronze tree but with real apples which are left to rot.\\nRed on Green was recreated ten years later for the exhibition Blast to Freeze: British Art in the 20th Century mounted by Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg in 2002–2003 and for the 2004 British Council exhibition Turning Points: 20th Century British Sculpture.\\nIn Stoke (2004), Gallaccio coated an old farm building at Edinburgh\\'s Jupiter Artland with almost 90 pounds of 70 percent cocoa, confectioner-quality chocolate. The work invited visitors to lick, touch, and stroke the walls.\\n2005 saw the publication of Anya Gallaccio: Silver Seed by Ridinghouse, which accompanied the artist\\'s exhibition commissioned by the Mount Stuart Trust for an installation at Mount Stuart on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, UK.\\nAt Houghton Hall in Norfolk, the Marquess of Cholmondeley commissioned a folly to the east of the great house. \"The Sybil Hedge\" is an \"artlandish\" folly. It is based on the signature of the marquis\\' grandmother, Sybil Sassoon.  Gallaccio has created a sarcophagus-like marble structure which is sited at the end of a path; and nearby is a copper-beech hedge which is planted in lines mirroring Sybil\\'s signature.\\nCommissioned for The Whitworth Art Gallery, Untitled (2016), dubbed the ‘ghost tree’, investigates themes of life, death and nature. Inspired by the removal of a decaying tree, Gallaccio worked from digital scans of the removed tree, later reproducing in ribbons of complex stainless steel plates, a monumental and reflective \\'ghost tree\\'. It has become \"a haunting response to loss and a timeless monument to nature.\"\\nIn a 2018 interview with Ocula, Gallaccio remarked of the YBA breakout exhibition Freeze: \"It feels just as precarious now as it did then. And I think it is good to constantly remind myself of that and not to get complacent. The bravado and the chutzpah of Freeze was impressive; it was more about a kind of attitude and that is something that has had reverberations.\"\\n\\n\\n== Awards and acknowledgements ==\\nIn 2006, she was listed on the Pink Power list of 100 most influential gay and lesbian people of 2006.\\nIn 2003, Gallaccio was shortlisted for the Turner Prize alongside Grayson Perry, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Willie Doherty. One of her pieces for the show was preserve \"beauty\", 1991–2003, which was made from glass, fixings and 2,000 red gerberas.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nThe Light Pours Out of Me, Jupiter Artland, Edinburgh, UK\\nFreeze, Surrey Docks, London, UK \\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nimages of Gallaccio\\'s work at Lehmann Maupin',\n",
              "  'Maurizio Cattelan (Italian: [mauˈrittsjo katteˈlan]; born 21 September 1960) is an Italian visual artist. Known primarily for his hyperrealistic sculptures and installations, Cattelan\\'s practice also includes curating and publishing. His satirical approach to art has resulted in him being frequently labelled as a joker or prankster of the art world.  Self-taught as an artist, Cattelan has exhibited internationally in museums and Biennials. \\nIn 2011, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City presented a retrospective of his work. Some of Cattelan\\'s better-known works include America, consisting of a solid gold toilet; La Nona Ora, a sculpture depicting a fallen Pope who has been hit by a meteorite; and Comedian, a fresh banana duct-taped to a wall.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nCattelan was born on 21 September 1960 in Padua, Italy.  He was raised there by his mother, a cleaning lady, and his father, a truck driver. He started his career in the early 1980s by designing and producing wooden furniture in Forlì (Italy). Cattelan has no formal training in art. He has said that in addition to reading art catalogues, \"making shows has been my school\".\\n\\n\\n== Art practice ==\\n\\nHumour and satire are at the core of Cattelan\\'s work; this approach has often seen him labelled variously as an art scene joker, jester or prankster. He has been described by Jonathan P. Binstock, curator of contemporary art at the Corcoran Gallery of Art \"as one of the great post-Duchampian artists and a smartass, too\". Discussing the topic of originality with ethnographer, Sarah Thornton, Cattelan explained, \"Originality doesn\\'t exist by itself. It is an evolution of what is produced. ... Originality is about your capacity to add.\" His work was often based on simple puns or subverts clichéd situations by, for example, substituting animals for people in sculptural tableaux. \"Frequently morbidly fascinating, Cattelan\\'s humour sets his work above the visual pleasure one-liners,\" wrote Carol Vogel of the New York Times.\\nCattelan\\'s first artwork has been noted as a photo art piece in 1989 entitled Lessico Familiare (Family Syntax), a framed self-portrait in which he is depicted forming a Hand Heart over his naked chest.\\nIn 1992, Cattelan started the Oblomov Foundation (named after Ivan Goncharov\\'s novel Oblomov and its idle main character) which raised ten thousand dollars to offer as a grant to an artist who would undertake not to make or show any work for one year. Since there were no successful applicants, Cattelan used the money for a long holiday in New York.\\nCattelan is commonly noted for his use of taxidermy during the mid-1990s. Novecento (1997) consists of the taxidermied body of a former racehorse named Tiramisu, which hangs by a harness in an elongated, drooping posture. Another work utilizing taxidermy is Bidibidobidiboo (1996), a miniature depiction of a squirrel slumped over its kitchen table, a handgun at its feet.\\nIn 1999, he started making life-size wax effigies of various subjects, including himself. One of his best known sculptures, La Nona Ora (1999), consists of an effigy of Pope John Paul II in full ceremonial costume being crushed by a meteor.\\n\\n\\n=== Curating ===\\nIn 1999, he co-curated with Jens Hoffmann the 6th Caribbean Biennial.\\nIn 2002, he co-founded with Ali Subotnick and Massimiliano Gioni \"The Wrong Gallery\", a glass door leading to a 2.5 square foot exhibition space at 516A½ West 20th street in New York City. After the building housing the gallery was sold, the door and gallery was put on display within the collection of the Tate Modern until 2009.\\nWith long-term collaborators Subotnick and Gioni, Cattelan also curated the 2006 Berlin Biennale. Articles by Cattelan frequently appear in international publications such as Flash Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Publishing ===\\nFrom 1996 to 2007, Cattelan collaborated with Dominique Gonzalez-Foster and Paola Manfrin on the publication Permanent Food, an occasional journal consisting of a pastiche of pages torn from other magazines and submissions by artists of similar material. From 2002 he collaborated on the satirical arts journal Charley, a series on contemporary artists.\\nIn 2009, Cattelan teamed up with Italian photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari to create an editorial for W magazine\\'s Art Issue.\\nIn 2010, they founded the magazine Toiletpaper, a bi-annual, picture-based publication. As part of a public art series at the High Line in 2012, Toiletpaper was commissioned with a billboard at the corner of 10th Avenue and West 18th Street in New York, showing an image of a woman\\'s manicured and jeweled fingers, detached from their hands, emerging from a vibrant blue velvet background. In 2014, Cattelan and Ferrari produced a fashion spread for the Spring Fashion issue of New York.\\nIn the project entitled 1968, A Toiletpaper collaboration between Maurizio Cattelan, Pierpaolo Ferrari and the Deste Foundation in Athens, Cattelan celebrates the works and time of Dakis Joannou and his collection of radical design.\\nToilet Paper differs from the two previously magazine projects, as its photographs were planned and designated solely for the magazine. The level of originality for this magazine surpassed the others, providing the audience vague, oddly familiar photographs to peruse through. Toilet Paper is a surrealist pantomime of images that the viewer cannot easily trace back to a starting point, while they\\'ve most likely been conjured by popular culture. It is a whirlwind of loud colors mixed in with the occasional black-and-white photo: \"the pictures probe the unconscious, tapping into sublimated perversions and spasms of violence.\"\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\nWorking Is a Bad Job (1993): At the 1993 Venice Biennale he leased his allotted space to an advertising agency, which installed a billboard promoting a new perfume.\\nErrotin, le vrai Lapin (1995), in which he persuaded his gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin to wear a giant pink rabbit costume shaped like a phallus to Cattelan\\'s gallery opening\\nAnother Fucking Readymade (1996): As a profound example of a found art hall; for an exhibition at the de Appel Arts Center in Amsterdam, he stole the entire contents of another artist\\'s show from a nearby gallery with the idea of passing it off as his own work, until the police insisted he return the loot on threat of arrest.\\nTuristi (1997), taxidermied pigeons and fake pigeon feces exhibited in the Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of 1997\\nIn 1997, at the Consortium in Dijon, Cattelan dug a coffin-shaped hole in the floor of the museum\\'s main gallery.\\nMother (1999); at the 1999 Venice Biennale, Cattelan executed this piece, a project that involved an Indian fakir, who practiced a daily ritual of being buried beneath sand in a small room, with only his clasped hands visible.\\nUntitled (2001), installation created for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam that depicts the artist peering mischievously from a hole in the floor at a gallery of 17th-century Dutch masters.\\nHim (2001): a sculpture resembling a schoolboy kneeling in prayer, except that the head has been replaced with the realistic likeness of Adolf Hitler.\\nAs part of the 2001 Venice Biennale, he erected a full sized HOLLYWOOD sign over the largest rubbish tip on Palermo, Sicily.\\n\\nLa rivoluzione siamo noi (We Are The Revolution) (2000), features a miniature Maurizio Cattelan, dangling from a Marcel Breuer–designed clothing rack. In this depiction, Cattelan contrasts the German artist Joseph Beuys statement, \"every man is an artist\", with his own, \"I am not an artist\".\\nDon\\'t Forget to Call Your Mother (2000), is a photograph by Cattelan that was utilized as a show invitation card, upon its introduction, by the Marian Goodman Gallery in New York City. \"The sign ironically reminds customers of their mothers\\' worries each time they approach the bar to drink...in mimicking this stern parental directive, the sign draws on attitudes regarding authority, independence, and disobedience\" (Susan Thompson).\\nDaddy, Daddy (2008) was initially premiered in the group exhibition theanyspacewhatever (2008–09) at the Guggenheim Museum. The piece was a site-specific installation in a small pool at the bottom of the Frank Lloyd Wright atrium rotunda, where a life-size Pinocchio doll lay face-down, giving the impression that he had jumped or fallen from above. \"Cattelan\\'s life-size effigy of a beloved fairytale character lying face down in the museum\\'s fountain reads as a crime scene replete with questions of intent: suicide, homicide, or ill-planned escape?\"\\nL.O.V.E. (2011), a 11-metre (36 ft) white marble sculpture middle finger sticking straight up from an otherwise fingerless hand, pointing away from Borsa Italiana in Milan.\\n\\nTuristi (2011), for the 2011 Venice Biennale, was made of 2,000 embalmed pigeons, not to be confused with the similarly-named Turisti (1997).\\nAmerica (2016), an 18-karat solid gold toilet, stolen from an exhibition in England in 2019.\\nComedian (2019), a banana duct taped to a wall, shown at Art Basel Miami and the edible part then there by the Georgian artist David Datuna (1974-2022) in a performance art called Hungry Artist\\nBlind (2021), a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks, featuring black resin monolith representing one of the World Trade Center towers intersected by the silhouette of a jetliner\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Retrospectives ===\\nA major retrospective titled All, assembling 130 objects of Cattelan\\'s career since 1989, opened in 2011 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. On the occasion of the exhibition, Cattelan announced his early retirement.\\nIn 2016 the Monnaie de Paris his retrospective of his work titled Not Afraid of Love.\\n\\n\\n=== Biennials ===\\nCattelan has participated in the Venice Biennale (1993, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2011), Manifesta 2 (1998), Luxembourg, Melbourne International Biennial 1999, and the 2004 Whitney Biennial in New York.\\n\\n\\n== Art market ==\\nAt a Sotheby\\'s auction in 2004, Cattelan\\'s Ballad of Trotsky (1996), a taxidermic horse suspended by ropes from a ceiling, was sold for $2 million, a record for the artist.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nCattelan was a finalist for the Guggenheim\\'s Hugo Boss Prize in 2000, received an honorary degree in Sociology from the University of Trento, Italy. In 2004, he was awarded the Arnold Bode prize from the Kunstverein Kassel, Germany. A career prize (a gold medal) was awarded to Maurizio Cattelan by the 15th Rome Quadriennale. On 24 March 2009, at the MAXXI Museum of Rome, singer and musician Elio came to receive the prize, claiming to be the real Cattelan.\\n\\n\\n== Film ==\\nA documentary film titled Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back was released in 2017. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, and played in theaters in 2017. The film, directed by Maura Axelrod, featured curator Massimiliano Gioni standing in for Cattelan. It followed Cattelan\\'s career retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\\n\\n\\n== Television ==\\nOn the occasion of his 2011 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, Cattelan was profiled on the American television program 60 Minutes. In 2016 a documentary about his life and work, The Art World\\'s Prankster: Maurizio Cattelan, aired on BBC.\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nCattelan was represented hanged with a noose around his neck in 2010 in the Vatican by the Sicilian artist Giuseppe Veneziano.\\nIn 2017, when the Trump administration White House requested the loan of a Vincent van Gogh painting, from the Guggenheim collection, Landscape With Snow, the museum\\'s chief curator Nancy Spector suggested instead Cattelan\\'s  work America, a sculpture of a gold toilet.\\nOn December 7, 2019, Comedian, an artwork created by Cattelan in an edition of three for the 2019 installment of Art Basel Miami Beach consisting of a banana held to a wall by duct tape, sold to an unnamed French art collector for $120,000 US.  The fruit in the work was later summarily eaten by Georgian performance artist David Datuna, who called his piece Hungry Artist. Meanwhile Galerie Perrotin, which is exhibiting the piece, replaced the fruit and stated that it is an \"idea\", while Datuna said \"it was very delicious\". In 27 April 2023 same event happened by a Korean student from Seoul National University in Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul. Using the same tape, he then taped the peel back onto the wall. The peel was later replaced by the museum with a fresh banana.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==',\n",
              "  'Pipilotti Elisabeth Rist (born 21 June 1962) is a Swiss visual artist best known for creating experimental video art and installation art. Her work is often described as surreal, intimate, abstract art, having a preoccupation with the female body. Her artwork is often categorized as feminist art.\\nRist\\'s work is known for its multi-sensory qualities, with overlapping projected imagery that is highly saturated with color, paired with sound components that are part of a larger environment with spaces for viewers to rest or lounge. Rist\\'s work often transforms the architecture or environment of a white cube gallery into a more tactile, auditory and visual experience.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nPipilotti Rist was born Elisabeth Charlotte Rist in Grabs in the Rhine Valley. Her father is a doctor and her mother is a teacher. She started going by \"Pipilotti\", a combination her childhood nickname \"Lotti\" with her childhood hero, Astrid Lindgren\\'s character Pippi Longstocking, in 1982.  Prior to studying art and film, Rist studied theoretical physics in Vienna for one semester. \\nFrom 1982 to 1986 Rist studied commercial art, illustration, and photography at the University of Applied Arts Vienna in Vienna. She later studied video at the Basel School of Design, Switzerland. From 1988 through 1994, she was member of the music band and performance group Les Reines prochaines. In 1997, her work was first featured in the Venice Biennial, where she was awarded the Premio 2000 Prize. From 2002 to 2003, she was invited by Professor Paul McCarthy to teach at UCLA as a visiting faculty member. From summer 2012 through to summer 2013, Rist spent a sabbatical in Somerset.\\n\\n\\n== Artwork ==\\nDuring her studies, Rist began making super 8 films. Her works generally last only a few minutes, borrowing from mass-media formats such as MTV and advertising, with alterations in their colors, speed, and sound. Her works generally treat issues related to gender, sexuality, and the human body.\\nHer colorful and musical works transmit a sense of happiness and simplicity. Rist\\'s work is regarded as feminist by some art critics. Her works are held by many important art collections worldwide.\\nIn I\\'m Not The Girl Who Misses Much (1986) Rist dances before a camera in a black dress with uncovered breasts. The images are often monochromatic and fuzzy. Rists repeatedly sings \"I\\'m not the girl who misses much,\" a reference to the first line of the song \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" by the Beatles. As the video approaches its end, the image becomes increasingly blue and fuzzy and the sound stops.\\nRist achieved notoriety with Pickelporno (Pimple porno) (1992), a work about the female body and sexual excitation. The fisheye camera moves over the bodies of a couple. The images are charged by intense colors, and are simultaneously strange, sensual, and ambiguous.\\nSip my Ocean (1996) is an audio-video installation projected as a mirrored reflection on two adjoining walls, duplicating the video as sort of Rorschach inkblots. Besides a television and tea-cups other domestic items can be seen sinking slowly under the ocean surface. The video is intercut with dreamlike frames of bodies swimming underwater and other melancholic images such as colourful overlays of roses across the heavens. Slightly abstract and layered the visuals invite the viewer to reveal its depth beneath the surface. Accompanying the video is Rist singing Chris Isaak\\'s \"Wicked Game\". Her voice is starting of sweetly but becomes gradually out of synchronicity with the song, ending in the shrieking chorus of “No, I don’t wanna fall in love”. Rist breaks the illusion of synchronicity in the video with the asynchrony of the audio and captures the human longing for and impossibility of being totally in tune with somebody else.\\nEver Is Over All (1997) shows in slow-motion a young woman walking along a city street, smashing the windows of parked cars with a large hammer in the shape of a tropical flower. At one point a police officer greets her. The audio video installation has been purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\\nRist\\'s nine video segments titled Open My Glade were played once every hour on a screen at Times Square in New York City, a project of the Messages to the Public program, which was founded in 1980.\\n“I want to see how you see – a portrait of Cornelia Providori” (2003) is an audio-visual work spanning 5:16. The sound was created in collaboration with Andreas Guggisberg, with whom Rist often works with. The main subject is the dialectical tension between macro and micro and how the continents are mirrored on the human body. The technical components are two to four layers of edited images, intricately cut and stacked on top of each other.\\nPour Your Body Out was a commissioned multimedia installation organized by Klaus Biesenbach and installed in the atrium of the Museum of Modern Art in early 2009. In an interview with Phong Bui published in The Brooklyn Rail, Rist said she chose the atrium for the installation \"because it reminds me of a church\\'s interior where you’re constantly reminded that the spirit is good and the body is bad. This spirit goes up in space but the body remains on the ground. This piece is really about bringing those two differences together.\"\\nHer first feature film, Pepperminta, had its world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival in 2009. She summarized the plot as \"a young woman and her friends on a quest to find the right color combinations and with these colors they can free other people from fear and make life better.”\\nWhen interviewed by The Guardian for a preview of her 2011 exhibition at London\\'s Hayward gallery, Rist described her feminism: \"Politically,\" she says, \"I am a feminist, but personally, I am not. For me, the image of a woman in my art does not stand just for women: she stands for all humans. I hope a young guy can take just as much from my art as any woman.\"\\nRist has likened her videos to that of women\\'s handbags, hoping that they\\'d have “room in them for everything: painting, technology, language, music, lousy flowing pictures, poetry, commotion, premonitions of death, sex, and friendliness.\"\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nIn 1998, Rist was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Prize administered by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The jury selected Douglas Gordon as winner.\\n\\n\\n== Works (Selection) ==\\n\\n\\n=== Architectural Art and Public Art ===\\nsince 1995: Flying Room.

              "  'Eduardo Kac (born July 3, 1962) is a Brazilian and American contemporary artist whose portfolio encompasses various forms of art including performance art, poetry, holography, interactive art, digital and online art, and BioArt. Recognized for his space art and transgenic works, Kac works with biotechnology to create organisms with new genetic attributes.   His interdisciplinary approach has seen the use of diverse mediums, from fax and photocopying to fractals, RFID implants, virtual reality, networks, robotics, satellites, telerobotics, virtual reality and DNA synthesis.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nKac was born July 3, 1962, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He became fluent in English as a child. He studied at the School of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, receiving a BA degree in 1985, and then at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received an MFA degree in 1990. In 2003 he received a doctorate from the Planetary Collegium at the University of Wales, Great Britain. Kac is a professor of art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\\n\\n\\n== Art career ==\\nKac began his art career in 1980 as a performance artist in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1982 he created his first digital work and in 1983 he invented holopoetry, exploring holography as an interactive art form. In 1985 he began creating animated poetic works on the French Minitel platform.\\nThroughout the 1980s Kac created telecommunications artworks, using media such as fax, television, and slow scan TV. In 1986 Kac created his first work of telepresence art, in which he used robots to bridge two or more physical locations. During the 1990s he continued to produce these works, expanding his practice with works of interspecies communications. \\nKac coined the term \"bio art\". Kac also created various terms to describe his transdisciplinary art practice, including biorobotics (functional merger of robotics and biotechnology), plantimal (plant with animal genetic material or animal with plant genetic material), and transgenic art (the expression of genes from one species in another in an artwork).\\nEarly notable works include \"Genesis\" (1999), where Kac translated a Genesis line into morse code and subsequently into DNA base pair and \"GFP Bunny\" (2000), where an albino rabbit was genetically altered with a jellyfish gene, causing it to emit a green glow under specific light conditions. This piece ignited extensive debates on the ethical implications of altering life forms for artistic purposes.\\nKac\\'s focus on space art encompasses decades-long effort to complete \"Ágora\" (1986–2023), a project designed for deep space. Over the years, he has collaborated with both NASA and SpaceX. His collaboration with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet in \"Inner Telescope\" (2017) led to the creation of a sculpture in space. Another of his artworks, \"Adsum\", made its journey to the International Space Station in 2022, in preparation for its final flight to the Moon. Kac has been an active participant in events promoting the convergence of art and space exploration, such as those organized by the Space Observatory, an office of France’s National Center for Space Studies.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nIn 1980 Kac launched the Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement) on Ipanema Beach, in Rio de Janeiro, with the stated goal of subverting the logic of normative pornography at the service of activism and imagination. Working under the extremely conservative political climate of Brazil under a military dictatorship, Kac and other Movement members, such as Glauco Mattoso, Leila Míccolis, and Hudinilson Jr., developed the new body-centered aesthetics collectively until 1982. Kac was also a performer with the Gang, the performance unit of the Movimento de Arte Pornô; the Gang performed in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and other cities.\\nBeginning in 1982, Kac started to create digital works. In 1983 Kac invented holographic poetry (which he also called holopoetry), the first of which was HOLO/OLHO, named after the Portuguese word for \"eye\". 23 holographic poems followed this first work, including Quando? (When?) (1987), a cylindrical work that could be read in two directions.\\nAround the same time, and drawing on his interest in experimental poetry forms, Kac began making animated poetry works with the French Minitel system that was then in use in Brazil. In 1985 he contributed one such work, Reabracadabra, to the Arte On Line exhibition, organized by the Livraria Nobel bookstore in São Paulo. Other Minitel animated poems by Kac include Recaos (1986), Tesão (1985/86) and D/eu/s (1986). In 1986, with Flavio Ferraz, Kac organized the Brasil High-Tech exhibition at the Galeria de Arte Centro Empresarial Rio in Rio de Janeiro.\\nFrom 1985 to as late as 1994, Kac did a number of telecommunications artworks that used Slow-scan television (SSTV), FAX, and live television, to create interactive exchanges between separate locations.\\nIn 1986 Kac created his first telepresence artwork, using a robot to connect distant audiences. In 1988 he began work on his Ornitorrinco project, a telepresence artwork completed in Chicago, in 1989, in collaboration with Ed Bennett. The work brought together robotics, telecommunications technologies and interactivity to create a robot that was controlled remotely. The piece allowed viewers in one location to control the robot\\'s camera and motion, creating a telepresent work and effecting the experience of viewers in the other location.\\nIn 1989 Kac moved from Rio de Janeiro to Chicago, where he would complete his MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nIn the 1990s, Kac continued creating telematic works, with Dialogical Drawing (1994) and Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1994) both using networks to explore the viewer experience of an artwork mediated between two sites in real time. In the latter case, the artwork joined a plant in New York city and a live canary in Kentucky in conversation. The inclusion of a bird and a plant as part of an interactive system is an early example of what Kac called interspecies communications.\\nIn 1996, Kac\\'s space artwork Monogram was included in the DVD that flew to Saturn mounted to the side of the Cassini spacecraft.\\nIn Teleporting An Unknown State (1994), Kac built a system that allowed a plant to survive in a gallery, illuminated not by direct sunlight but by the action of local or remote viewers of the work. In practice, local or remote viewers of the work selected from a set of webcams facing the sky of distant cities. A video projector above the plant relayed the webcam images to the plant, thus enabling it to do photosynthesis with light transmitted remotely. As a result, the system transmitted light values (frequency and amplitude) from distant skies to a local plant.\\nKac coined the term \"bio art\" with his 1997 performance work Time Capsule. In Time Capsule, Kac implanted himself with an RFID chip originally designed for use in pets. A participant in Chicago then triggered the RFID scanned in the Brazilian gallery where Kac was performing, causing the scanner to display a unique code for the implant. Kac then registered himself on the pet database associated with the implant, becoming the first human to do so. Time Capsule was simultaneously live on television and the Internet.\\n\\nBy the late 90s Kac defined himself either as a \"transgenic artist\" or a \"bio artist\", and was using biotechnology and genetics to create works that used scientific techniques and simultaneously critiqued them.\\nKac\\'s next transgenic artwork, created in 1998/99 and titled Genesis, involved him taking a quote from the Bible (Genesis 1:26 – \"Let man have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth\"), transferring it into Morse code, and finally, translating that Morse code (by a conversion principle specially developed by the artist for this work) into the base pairs of genetics. The new DNA sequence was introduced into bacteria. Participants were then able to shine ultraviolet lights onto the bacteria containing the new DNA, thus altering it. So when Kac translated it back to English, it said something completely different. Through this work, Kac encourages audiences to consider the new interconnectedness between biology, technology, and meaning.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nIn one of his best known works, GFP Bunny, presented in 2000 in Avignon, France, Kac commissioned a French laboratory to create a green-fluorescent rabbit; a rabbit born with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) gene from a type of jellyfish. Kac named the rabbit Alba. Under a specific blue light, the rabbit fluoresces green. GFP Bunny proved to be hugely controversial, in part due to the unprecedented nature of the artwork, in part because of the general lack of familiarity with the safety of the process at the close of the twentieth century. \\nKac\\'s original aim was for Alba to live with his family, but prior to the scheduled release of Alba to Kac, the lab retracted their agreement and decided that Alba should remain in the lab. Kac responded by creating a series of works that called for her freedom. Other works would follow, focused on celebrating her life.\\nGFP Bunny appeared in Big Bang Theory, Sherlock, and Simpsons, and in novels such as Oryx and Crake, by Margaret Atwood, and Next, by Michael Crichton.\\nHis work Natural History of the Enigma (2003–2008) continued in the theme of bio art by merging his DNA with that of a petunia, creating a hybrid organism that Kac called a plantimal. The plant, also given the name Edunia (from Eduardo and Petunia), mimicked the flow of blood through human veins by mixing Kac\\'s DNA only with the plant\\'s genetic components that made the veins in its leaves red.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nIn 2017 Kac collaborated with French astronaut Thomas Pesquet to create an artwork in space called Inner Telescope, an artwork conceived for zero gravity and made aboard the International Space Station. Kac worked with the French Space Observatory office, from the French Space Agency, to have this work made in space by the astronaut Thomas Pesquet. Following Kac\\'s instructions, Pesquet cut and folded two pieces of paper into a sculptural form. Floating in zero gravity, the form could be read as the three letters forming the French word for me, M-O-I, or a stylized human figure with the umbilical cord cut.\\n\\n\\n=== 2020s ===\\nSince 2019, Kac has been developing Adsum, an artwork for the Moon. Conceived in five phases, as of 2022 Kac had completed the first three milestones. Adsum is a glass artwork with four visual symbols internally laser-engraved in three dimensions and is meant to exist in the lunar environment. The four symbols that constitute the work are: an hourglass (representing time at a human scale), two circles (one large, representing the Earth; one small, representing the Moon), and the infinity symbol (representing time at a cosmic scale).\\n\\n\\n== Controversy ==\\nEduardo Kac\\'s work has frequently been an object of debate. One of the most prominent instances arose from his artwork \"GFP Bunny\" in 2000. The piece centered around Alba, an albino rabbit that was genetically engineered by incorporating the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a jellyfish into her genome. This resulted in the rabbit possessing the ability to glow green under blue light. Some critics and animal rights activists raised concerns about the ethical implications of such genetic manipulation purely for the sake of art. \\nKac\\'s later project, \"Inner Telescope\", created inside the International Space Station (ISS), stirred debate of a different kind. The artwork, crafted from paper and designed to spell \"Moi\" (French for \"me\"), was a conceptual play on individual and collective self. The philosophical depth and utility of such an endeavor was questioned, particularly in the context of contemporary societal challenges. The project was also critiqued for potentially being an escape from the urgent issues on Earth, rather than addressing them head-on.\\n\\n\\n== Permanent collections ==\\nKac\\'s work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Modern, London, Institut Valencià d\\'Art Modern in Valencia, Spain, Reina Sophia Museum, Madrid, Spain, Les Abattoirs Toulouse, France, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Several of Kac\\'s artist\\'s books are included in the library of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nIn 1998 he received the Leonardo Award for Excellence from ISAST. In 1999, he received the Inter Communication Center (Tokyo) Biennial Award in 1999.\\nIn 2002 he received the Creative Capital Award in the discipline of Emerging Fields.\\nIn 2008 he received the Golden Nica award at Ars Electronica for his project Natural History of the Enigma.\\n\\n\\n== Bibliography ==\\nBooks by Eduardo Kac\\n\\nLuz & Letra: Ensaios De Arte, Literatura E Comunicação [Light & Letter: Essays on Art, Literature and Communication].

              "  'Michael James Aleck Snow  (December 10, 1928 – January 5, 2023) was a Canadian artist who worked in a range of media including film, installation, sculpture, photography, and music. His best-known films are Wavelength (1967) and La Région Centrale (1971), with the former regarded as a milestone in avant-garde cinema.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nMichael James Aleck Snow was born in Toronto on December 10, 1928. He studied at Upper Canada College and the Ontario College of Art. He had his first solo exhibition in 1957. Snow exhibited with the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto throughout the 1960s, becoming even more involved with the gallery upon his return to Toronto in 1971. In the early 1960s Snow moved to New York with his wife, artist Joyce Wieland, where they remained for nearly a decade.  For Snow this move resulted in a proliferation of creative ideas and connections and his work increasingly gained recognition. He returned to Canada in the early 1970s \"an established figure, multiply defined as a visual artist, a filmmaker, and a musician.\"\\nHis work has appeared at exhibitions across Europe, North America and South America. Snow\\'s works were included in the shows marking the reopening of both the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2000 and the MoMA in New York in 2005. In March 2006, his works were included in the Whitney Biennial.\\nSnow\\'s first wife was fellow artist Joyce Wieland, whom he married in 1956. The couple moved to New York City in 1963, but they moved back to Toronto about a decade later and divorced in 1976. In 1990, he married curator and writer Peggy Gale, and they had one son. He was the uncle of filmmaker and video artist Su Rynard.\\nSnow died from pneumonia in Toronto on January 5, 2023, at the age of 94.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Films ===\\nSnow is considered one of the most influential experimental filmmakers of all time. Annette Michelson, in writing about Snow, his 1967 film Wavelength, and his films in general, speaks of the impact of Snow\\'s films, placing viewers in a \"position to more fully understand the particular impact of Snow\\'s filmic work from 1967 on, to discern the reasons for the large consensus given\" to Wavelength when it was honoured with the Grand Prize at the 1967 Experimental Film Festival EXPRMNTL 4 in Knokke, Belgium, and that \"Wavelength, [appears] as a celebration of the \\'apparatus\\' and a confirmation of the status of the subject, and it is in those terms that we may begin to comprehend the profound effect it had upon the broadest spectrum of viewers....\" Wavelength has been the subject of numerous retrospectives internationally. Film scholar Scott MacDonald says of Snow that \"[f]ew filmmakers have had as large an impact on the recent avant-garde film scene as Canadian Michael Snow, whose Wavelength is probably the most frequently discussed \\'structural\\' film.\"\\nWavelength has been designated and preserved as a masterwork by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada and was named #85 in the 2001 Village Voice critics\\' list of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century  .\\nSnow\\'s films have premiered in film festivals worldwide and five of his films have premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). In 2000, TIFF commissioned Snow, along with Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg, to make a series of short films collectively titled Preludes, for the 25th Anniversary of the festival.\\nIn his Village Voice review of Snow\\'s 2002 film *Corpus Callosum, J. Hoberman writes that Snow\\'s films are \"[r]igorously predicated on irreducible cinematic facts [and] Snow\\'s structuralist epics—Wavelength and La Région Centrale—[announce] the imminent passing of the film era. Rich with new possibilities, *Corpus Callosum heralds the advent of the next. Whatever it is, it cannot be too highly praised.\" *Corpus Callossum was screened at the Toronto, Berlin, Rotterdam, and Los Angeles film festivals amongst others. In January 2003, Snow won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association\\'s Douglas Edwards Experimental/Independent Film/Video Award for *Corpus Callosum.\\n\\n\\n=== Music ===\\nOriginally a professional jazz musician, Snow has a long-standing interest in improvised music, as indicated by the soundtrack to his film New York Eye and Ear Control. As a pianist, he has performed solo and with other musicians in North America, Europe and Japan. Snow performed regularly in Canada and internationally, often with the improvisational music ensemble CCMC and has released more than a half dozen albums since the mid-1970s. In 1987, Snow issued The Last LP (Art Metropole), which purported to be a documentary recording of the dying gasps of ethnic musical cultures from around the globe including Tibet, Syria, India, China, Brazil, Finland and elsewhere, with thousands of words of pseudo-scholarly supplementary notes, but was, in fact, a series of multi-tracked recordings of Snow himself, who gave the joke away only in a single column of text in the disc\\'s gatefold jacket, printed backwards and readable in a mirror.  One track, purported to be a document of a coming-of-age ritual from Niger, is a pastiche of Whitney Houston\\'s song \"How Will I Know.\"\\nSnow, with Richard Serra, James Tenney and Bruce Nauman, performed Steve Reich\\'s Pendulum Music on May 27, 1969 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\n\\n\\n=== Other media ===\\n\\nBefore Snow moved to New York in 1963, he began a long-term project that for six years would be his trademark: the Walking Woman. Martha Langford in Michael Snow: Life & Work describes this work as employing a single form that offered an infinite number of creative possibilities, the figure itself perceived variably as \"a positive (a presence to be looked at) and a negative (an absence to be looked through).\" His 1962 work Four to Five consisted of a grid of photographs of the Walking Woman placed in Toronto streets and subway stations, inviting the viewer to consider how public space transforms the sculpture.\\nLangford identifies duality as a guiding principle in Snow’s work. By combining materials and methods Snow creates hybrid objects that often defy classification. A work which exemplifies Snow\\'s testing of stylistic boundaries is his 1979 installation Flight Stop (also titled Flightstop), a site-specific work in Toronto\\'s Eaton Centre mall, which looks like a sculptural representation of sixty geese, but is in fact an intricate combination of fibreglass forms and photographs of a single goose.\\nIn 1982, Snow sued the corporate owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre for violating his moral rights by altering Flight Stop. In the landmark case Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd, the Ontario High Court of Justice affirmed the artist\\'s right to the integrity of their work. The operator of the Toronto Eaton Centre was found liable for violating Michael Snow\\'s moral rights by putting Christmas bows on the work.\\nSnow\\'s works have been in Canadian pavilion at world fairs since his Walking Women sculpture was exhibited at Expo 67 in Montréal. He was chosen to represent Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1970; this was the first solo exhibition held at the Biennale\\'s Canadian Pavilion. His bookwork BIOGRAPHIE of the Walking Woman / de la femme qui marche 1961-1967 (2004) was published in Brussels by La Lettre vole. It consists of images of the public appearances of his globally famous icon.\\nAnarchive2: Digital Snow describes Michael Snow as \"one of the most significant artists in contemporary art and cinema of the past 50 years.\" This 2002 DVD was initiated by Paris’ Centre Pompidou and was produced with the support of la foundation Daniel Langlois, Université de Paris, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council, Téléfilm Canada and Montreal’s Époxy. It is an encyclopedia of Snow\\'s works across media, browsed in a manner inimitably and artfully created by Snow. Its 4,685 entries include film clips, sculpture, photographs, audio and musical clips, and interviews.\\n\\n\\n== Retrospectives and honours ==\\n\\nIn 1993, The Michael Snow Project, lasting several months, was a multivenue retrospective of Snow’s works in Toronto exhibited at several public venues and at the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Power Plant. Concurrently his works were the subjects of four books published by Alfred A. Knopf Canada. Snow has shown internationally in both galleries and cinemas, including a retrospective of his work at the British Film Institute, London where his celluloid works were shown in the cinemas and his digital works in the gallery (The BFI Gallery). The project, titled \\'Yes Snow Show\\', took place in 2009 and was co-curated by Elisabetta Fabrizi and Chris Meigh-Andrew.\\nIn 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2007 \"for his contributions to international visual arts as one of Canada’s greatest multidisciplinary contemporary artists\".

              "  \"Ronald Bladen  (July 13, 1918 – February 3, 1988) was a Canadian-born American painter and sculptor. He is particularly known for his large-scale sculptures. His artistic stance, was influenced by European Constructivism, American Hard-Edge Painting, and sculptors such as Isamu Noguchi and David Smith. Bladen in turn had stimulating effect on a circle of younger artists including Carl Andre, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and others, who repeatedly referred to him as one of the 'father figures' of Minimal Art.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nCharles Ronald Wells Bladen was born on July 13, 1918, to Muriel Beatrice Tylecote and Kenneth Bladen, both British immigrants living in Vancouver, Canada. In 1922 the family moved to the Washington state before returning to Canada to live in Victoria, British Columbia in 1932. The artist displayed his love of art at a young age. At ten years old Bladen began drawing intensively, making copies of works by Titian, Picasso and Matisse. In 1937 the artist enrolled in the Vancouver School of Art where he studied until 1939.\\n\\n\\n== San Francisco ==\\nIn 1939 the artist moved to San Francisco, where he enrolled in the California School of Fine Arts. In 1941, when drafted and subsequently declared unfit for service, the artist was obliged to work as a ship's welder at the navy dockyards. Using the skills he learned in this capacity the artist supported him for years as a toolmaker.\\nIn 1946 Bladen traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, New Orleans and New York on a grant from the San Francisco Art Association. In 1948 he was married to the actress Barbara Gross. They separated in 1955. During this time he also befriended the writers Jack Kerouac, Henry Miller and Allen Ginsberg.\\n\\n\\n== New York ==\\nIn 1956, Bladen moved to New York, where he lived on Houston Street. Through Al Held he met George Sugarman and Nicholas Krushenick and John Krushenick, who together founded the Brata Gallery co-operative in 1957.\\nThe artist's paintings from this period mark a departure from his earlier romantic works. They are defined by highly concentrated segments of color set against monochromatic backgrounds. \\nIn 1960, he took over Al Held's studio at 5 West 21st Street, where he began to focus on making collages of folded paper and large scale plywood relief paintings. \\nIn 1962, he exhibited his plywood paintings for the first time at the Brata Gallery and the Green Gallery in New York. The following year he made his first free-standing, colored sculptures from plywood boards with metal struts. From this time on the artist dedicated himself exclusively to sculpture.\\nIn 1964, he showed his first sculpture, White Z, at an exhibition in the Park Place Gallery in New York where he befriended Connie Reyes, who later became his companion. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by the National Endowment of the Arts. \\nIn 1965, Bladen participated in the critically acclaimed Concrete Expressionism show curated by critic Irving Sandler at New York University, which also featured the work of sculptors George Sugarman and David Weinrib and painters Al Held and Knox Martin.\\nIn 1966, Bladen showed a tripartite work made the previous year, Three Elements, at the exhibition, Primary Structures Younger American and British Artists, in the Jewish Museum in New York. A seminal moment in the history of sculpture, this exhibition brought the language of minimal sculpture into the public eye.  Artists represented in the exhibition include Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Walter De Maria Robert Morris and others.\\nIn 1967 he was included in the Scale as Content exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, which brought together important sculptures by Bladen, Barnett Newman and Tony Smith, he showed his monumental sculpture, The X.\\nStarting in 1967 he received a number of important public commissions, was represented in 1968 at documenta 4 in Kassel, and was among the circle of artists presented to a European art public under the title, Minimal Art, West Berlin. In 1970, he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship.\\n\\n\\n== Teaching ==\\nFrom 1974 to 1976, Bladen taught as a guest lecturer at Columbia University in New York and was awarded the Mark Rothko Fellowship in 1975. In 1976, Bladen was appointed teacher at the Parsons The New School for Design, a post he held until 1978 and he also taught at the School of Visual Arts. He was an Artist in Residence in 1981/1982 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (Maine), and in 1982–1983 as a guest lecturer at Yale University in New Haven (Connecticut). In 1977, he was once again awarded the National Endowment of the Arts.\\n\\n\\n== Public commissions ==\\nStarting in 1967 Ronald Bladen received a number of important public commissions including: The Cathedral Evening  for the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York, 1969,  Vroom Sh-Sh-Sh for Buffalo, New York, 1974, Raiko I for Galerie Schmela in Düsseldorf, 1975,  Cosmic Seed for Des Moines (Iowa), 1977, Kama Sutra for Central Park, New York, New York, 1978, Oracle’s Vision for Springfield, Ohio in 1981, Black Lightning for Seattle and the King Faisal University in Riyadh, Host of the Ellipse for Baltimore, Maryland, in 1981, and Sonar Tide for Peoria, Illinois, in 1983.\\n\\n\\n== Selected exhibitions ==\\n1956 Paintings by Ronald Bladen, Fine Art Gallery, University of British  Columbia, Vancouver, BC\\n1965 Concrete Expressionism, Loeb Student Center, New York University,  New York, NY\\n1966 Primary Structures.

              "  \"Diana Thater (born May 14, 1962, in San Francisco) is an American artist, curator, writer, and educator. She has been a pioneering creator of film, video, and installation art since the early 1990s. She lives and works in Los Angeles, California.\\n\\n\\n== Education and career ==\\nThater studied Art History at New York University and earned her BA in 1984.  In 1990 she was awarded an MFA from Art Center College of Design.\\nSince 2000, Thater has been the artist-in-residence for The Dolphin Project, a non-profit organization that protects cetaceans from slaughter, captivity, and abuse.  In 2009, Diana Thater taught art at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nThater's work explores the temporal qualities of video and film while literally expanding it into space.  She is best known for her site-specific installations in which she manipulates architectural space through forced interaction with projected images and tinted light, such as knots + surfaces (2001) and Delphine (1999) in the Kulturkirche St. Stephani (2009) and the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (2010).\\nThater's primary interest lies in exploring the relationship between humans and the natural world and the distinctions between untouched and manipulated nature. Despite nods to structural film, Thater's underlying reference points are closer to panoramic landscape painting. Thater's stated belief is that film and video are not by definition narrative media, and that abstraction can, and does exist in representational moving images.\\n\\n\\n=== Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden ===\\n\\nOne of Thater's earliest works is Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden (1992), a two part video installation exhibited for the first time in 1992. Thater lived for a time at Claude Monet's former home in Giverny, where she filmed videos on her walks in the home's gardens. The piece is composed of footage of those walks, separated into its component reds, greens and blues; Part I of Oo Fifi is an installation of the three color-separated videos projected on a wall not quite aligned with one another, creating a multi-color effect, while Part II shows the three videos aligned, so the video appears nearly perfectly clear and accurately colored. The third component of the work is wall text listing the scientific names of the plants found in the garden at Monet's home, in addition to a pink light installed in the space where the work is shown.\\nThater had recently finished her MFA and was living in Los Angeles when Oo Fifi was first shown in 1992, over the course of two shows. Thater has said that much of the form of early works like this came from necessity; she was unable to afford screens for the work, so she projected the videos onto a wall in the exhibition space and covered the windows with gels.\\n\\n\\n=== Delphine ===\\nDelphine is one of Thater's most well-known works and was exhibited not only within the United States but also in several different locations around the world, including France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The Delphine exhibition consists of the simultaneous projection of multiple footages of underwater and dolphins. The footages are projected on various surfaces, not just the walls, to create an enveloping and engaging space for the viewers. Thater also placed the projectors in a way that the viewer's silhouette created due to the projector light can physically be part of the work and interact with the subjects within her footages. Unlike some films or videos dealing with animals, Thater's Delphine does not include narration. Thater left out narrations and avoided inserting specific narrative because she believes that animals do not live their lives narratively. Thater wanted to show the animals as they are without enforcing human perspective on them.\\n\\n\\n=== Science, Fiction ===\\nExhibited in 2015, Thater's Science, Fiction is a video installation that is divided into two parts. The two parts are placed in separate rooms, but both rooms have blue hue due to the light beams attached on the floor corners. The first part consists of two monitors, facing each other, showcasing footages of planetarium from Griffith Observatory, which is located in Los Angeles. The second part consists of huge box, size of a small room, that has a projection of dung beetles above it and intense yellow light under it. The purpose behind this exhibition was to visually show the recent scientific discovery that dung beetles use starlight during night time to navigate themselves. Through her exhibition, Thater commented on impact of light pollution on wildlife.\\n\\n\\n=== Chernobyl ===\\nFirst exhibited in 2011, Thater's Chernobyl showcases multiple footages recorded in Prypiat in Chernobyl. The exhibition consists of simultaneous display of multiple footages of different locations in Prypiat. The center of the exhibition is the footage of a movie theater and all four sides of the movie theater are projected on the gallery space. Over the projection of the movie theater, the other footages, such as buildings, animals and nature, are projected as well. This exhibition is not only about showing negative human impact on nature, but to also show how life still persists even under such condition.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nSince her first solo show in 1991, Thater has staged many exhibitions in museums and galleries in the United States and internationally. Her notable solo shows include Stan Douglas and Diana Thater (1994), Kunstinstituut Melly, Rotterdam, Netherlands; China (1995), Renaissance Society, Chicago; electric mind (1996), Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg, Austria; Selected Works 1992–1996 (1996), Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; Orchids in the Land of Technology (1997), Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; The best animals are the flat animals (1998), MAK Center for Art and Architecture, Los Angeles; Projects 64: Diana Thater (1998), Museum of Modern Art, New York; Knots + Surfaces (2001-2003), Dia Chelsea, New York; gorillagorillagorilla (2009), Kunsthaus Graz, Austria; Between Science and Magic (2010), Santa Monica Museum of Art (former; now Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles); and Chernobyl (2011-2012), Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane, Australia.\\nHer numerous group exhibitions include the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1997, 2006) and the Carnegie International (1999).\\nThe artist is represented by David Zwirner, New York.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nIn 2011, Thater received an Award for Artistic Innovation from the Center for Cultural Innovation in Los Angeles. She used the grant to complete Chernobyl, a large-scale installation project which documents the post-human landscape at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site in the Ukraine, marking the 25th anniversary of the explosion in 2011. She has been the recipient of other notable awards, including the Phelan Award in Film and Video (2006), a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2005), an Étant-donnés Foundation Grant (1996), and a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1993).\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nDiana Thater.

              "  'Henry Bond, FHEA (born 13 June 1966) is an English writer, photographer, and visual artist. In his Lacan at the Scene (2009), Bond made contributions to theoretical psychoanalysis and forensics.\\nIn 1990, with Sarah Lucas, Bond organised the art exhibition East Country Yard Show, which was influential in the formation and development of the Young British Artists movement; together with Damien Hirst, Angela Bulloch, and Liam Gillick, the two were \"the earliest of the YBAs.\"\\nBond\\'s visual art tends to appropriation and pastiche; he has exhibited work made collaboratively with YBA artists including a photograph made with Sam Taylor-Wood and the Documents Series, made with Liam Gillick. In the 1990s, Bond was a photojournalist working for British fashion, music, and youth culture magazine The Face. In 1998, his photobook of street fashions in London The Cult of the Street was published. His Point and Shoot (Cantz, 2000), explored the photo-genres of surveillance, voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism.\\nIn 2007, Bond completed his doctoral research; in 2009, he was appointed Senior Lecturer in Photography at Kingston University.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\n\\nHenry Bond was born in Forest Gate in East London in 1966. He attended Goldsmiths at the University of London, graduating in 1988, from the Department of Art, with fellow alumni Angela Bulloch, Ian Davenport, Anya Gallaccio, Gary Hume, and Michael Landy—each of whom was to participate in the YBA art scene.\\nBond attended Middlesex University in Hendon studying for an MA in Psychoanalysis, where he was taught by Lacan scholar Bernard Burgoyne. Bond was a research student at the University of Gloucestershire in Cheltenham Spa between 2004 and 2007; he received a doctorate in 2007.\\nBond teaches postgraduate photography, in the Faculty of Art, Design & Architecture, at Kingston University; he is a Senior Lecturer in Photography, in the School of Fine Art.\\n\\n\\n== Critical writing ==\\n\\n\\n=== Lacan at the Scene ===\\n\\nLacan at the Scene is a work of non-fiction by Bond, published in 2009 by MIT Press. The book consists of interpretations of forensic photographs from twenty-one crime scenes from 1950s and 1960s England. The thesis put forward in the book is that homicide can be considered in terms of Jacques Lacan\\'s tripartite psychological model, thus any murder can be classified as either neurotic, psychotic, or perverse. Bond\\'s approach is closely linked to  Walter Benjamin\\'s assertion that, \"photography, with its devices of slow motion and enlargement, reveals the secret. It is through photography that we first discover the existence of the optical unconscious, just as we discover the instinctual unconscious through psychoanalysis.\"\\nLacan at the Scene is an interdisciplinary study which is simultaneously an application of the theories of Jacques Lacan in relation to offender profiling and an inquiry into the nature and essence of photography.\\n\\nBond\\'s book considers the effects of photography on the spectator, the photographer and the photographic subject. He refers to a wide range of contextual material including \"J.G. Ballard, William Burroughs, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre and Slavoj Žižek ... and the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, Michelangelo Antonioni, David Lynch and Christopher Nolan, among many others.\" The book contains a foreword essay The Camera\\'s Posthuman Eye by the Slovenian philosopher and critical theorist Slavoj Žižek.\\nMany of the photographs reproduced in the book are sexually explicit—they depict murder victims who were raped or tortured before the killing.\\nDescribing his research, in a 2007 interview, Bond said, \"the press reporter\\'s access to a crime scene is restricted, it is literally blocked by the ubiquitous black and yellow tape emblazoned with the exhortation: CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS. The photographs that I have worked with are documents made in a place that the press photographer or reporter cannot go.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Critical reception ====\\nThe critical reception of Lacan at the Scene was positive including reviewers commending the book as \\'insightful\\', \\'ground-breaking\\', \\'audacious\\' and \\'enthralling\\' – writing in the peer-reviewed journal The European Legacy, Viola Brisolin said, \\'\\'Lacan at the Scene is a brilliant, ground-breaking work that will appeal to cultural practitioners and theorists, and to everybody interested in the dialogue between psychoanalysis and visual studies.\" Writing in the peer-reviewed academic journal Philosophy of Photography, Margaret Kinsman said \"Bond\\'s exploration ... reminds us of just how used to order we are and how shocking and easy its dissolution is ... his approach evokes a kind of aesthetic pleasure, which unsettles even as it satisfies.\"\\nEmily Nonko\\'s review said, \"Lacan at the Scene ultimately presents a complex dynamic between both psychoanalysis and medium of the camera, the way that photography permits the viewer to delve into both the murder\\'s mind and the victim\\'s corpse, the psychological as well as the corporeal.\"\\nReviewing the book for Time Out New York Parul Sehgal said: \"While Bond\\'s interpretations occasionally strain credulity, his sensibility enthralls. His goal isn\\'t police work per se, but to reveal how humble objects at the margins of crime scenes become powerfully allusive and lend themselves to a narrative.\"\\nDaniel Hourigan, writing for Metapsychology Online Reviews said, \"for the vast majority of the discussions in the more applied third, fourth, and fifth chapters, Lacan at the Scene enjoys a lucid and precise execution. The early chapters help to bring together the theoretical, discursive, and political elements that make these later chapters capable of pursuing such a rigorous and insightful project.\"\\n\\n\\n=== The Gaze of the Lens ===\\nIn July 2011, Bond\\'s second book on the theory and philosophy of photography, The Gaze of the Lens, was self-published using the Kindle direct publishing format; the book consists of one hundred \"concise observations and statements on photography.\" In the book, Bond \"activates, reconfigures, qualifies, and occasionally contradicts assertions made a diverse range of thinkers and practitioners including Rankin, Stieg Larsson, Antonioni, Charles Baudelaire, J.G. Ballard, Raymond Chandler, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Lacan, Georg Hegel and Slavoj Žižek.\"\\n\\n\\n== Street photography ==\\nA characteristic of Bond\\'s style is his pastiche and appropriation of familiar types of photograph, for example, writing in Frieze, Ben Seymour said, \"Bond carries on producing images of a homogenised, outside-less culture in a perpetual present of consumption which may be just ahead of, or self-consciously behind – but always deliberately in between – the conventions of advertising, fashion, surveillance or family photographs.\" Bond has also considered his work in relation to the dérive – literally: \"drifting\" – theorised by Guy Debord and the city walks of the flâneur or psychogeographer.\\nCharacterizing his conception of street photography, in a 1998 interview, Bond said: \"[For me street photography] is parallel to the psychoanalytic session, in that anything can be mentioned.\" Bond began his street photography in the late-1990s and continued for approximately ten years concluding with his Interiors in 2005. Monograph books of Bond\\'s street photography include two published in Germany – Point and Shoot (Ostfildern: Cantz) and La vie quotidienne (Essen: 20/21).\\n\\n\\n=== The Cult of the Street ===\\n\\nBond\\'s large book, The Cult of the Street, was published in 1998 by \"posh West End gallery,\" Emily Tsingou Gallery, London. The 274 photographs included in the book depict daily life in London in the mid-1990s. Many of the photographs included in the book were originally taken by Bond whilst shooting commissioned features for the style and culture monthly The Face—during the period that the magazine was art directed by Lee Swillingham and Stuart Spalding, 1995–1999. The book includes a foreword essay, \"A Response to the Photographs,\" by psychoanalyst and author Darian Leader. It has been suggested that the title of the book is a reference to the 1926 Siegfried Kracauer essay The Cult of Distraction.\\nIn 2002, a group of large-scale printed examples from The Cult of the Street were included in the Barbican Centre survey Rapture: Art\\'s Seduction by Fashion Since 1970 and these were shown again, in 2004, at the Museum of London, in an exhibition titled, The London Look: Fashion from Street to Catwalk.\\n\\n\\n==== Critical response ====\\nReviewing the book for the British newspaper The Independent, fashion writer Tamsin Blanchard described the book as, \"a rich social document of the way we dress—rather than the way fashion designers like to imagine we dress\".\\n\\nWriting in his commentary on the influence of the Young British Artists, High Art Lite, the art historian Julian Stallabrass said, \"The Cult of the Street is telling of many characteristics of High Art Lite and its engagement with mass culture and the media. It takes as its subject not just the conventions of the street but youth and their modes of display in shops, clubs, parties, restaurants and even private homes ... they don\\'t do much, Bond\\'s people; they shop, of course, persistently, and present themselves to each other and the camera, dance sometimes, but the book is composed above all of an intricate fabric of exchanged glances and gazes.\"\\nWriting in the British contemporary art journal Art Monthly, critic David Barrett said, \"[In The Cult of the Street] values and meanings are constantly on the slide, be they the meaning of wearing brown instead of black, Airwalk instead of Airmax or including the subject\\'s shoes in full-length photographs instead of cropping them. Bond sets out to document these fleeting social codes while also attempting to ride roughshod over the accepted conventions of photography.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Point and Shoot ===\\n\\nBond\\'s book of street photography Point and Shoot, was published by German fine arts publisher Hatje Cantz Verlag, in 2000; many of the images included imitate forms of photography that are derided or taboo, such as voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism; other images are grainy and suggest surveillance or CCTV images—the photographer is either an intrusive, prying, nuisance, or else reduced to an automaton-like spectator on daily life.\\nPrinted examples from the book were exhibited in both commercial and museum gallery exhibitions, including a survey—selected and organised by curator Eric Troncy—which was on display at the contemporary arts centre Le Consortium in Dijon, France, March through May 1999.\\n\\n\\n==== Critical response ====\\nWriting in The Japan Times, in 2000, journalist Jennifer Purvis said, \"Bond elicits a film noir quality from a city that prides itself on the worst side of its nature. It is contemporary London in all its banality and beauty, portrayed in heavy, highly contrasted black-and-white photographs that evoke nostalgia more keenly than an old movie ... the images all speak of the life, London life, captured by a peering, voyeuristic Londoner.\"\\nReviewing the book in Frieze, the critic Benedict Seymour said, \"Bond jumbles up his subjects—street scenes, shop windows, night-clubs, posh parties, backstage fashion shows, intimate portraits and sex club sybaritics—as well as the composition, with the apparent intention of throwing our will to categorise, and so comprehend the image, into disarray.\"\\nIn Germany, the book was awarded a Kodak Deutscher Fotobuchpreis in 2000.\\n\\n\\n=== Interiors Series ===\\n\\nBond\\'s follow up to Point and Shoot, Interiors Series was published in Belgium, in 2005, by Fotomuseum Antwerp. The photographs included in the book appear to explicitly and deliberately invade the privacy of the subjects, who are captured—unaware of the presence of a photographer—at leisure, in their private dwellings. Writing in an essay accompanying the photographs, Bond said, \"for me voyeuristic \\'fixation\\' and the \\'photographic act\\' have become inseparable. It is the sense of \\'the illicit\\' that these photographs are leveraging. I must not be caught taking them, and in a way, the viewer of the photograph is included in my anti-social activity, they too are looking when they should not be.\"\\n\\n\\n== Exhibition organiser ==\\n\\n\\n=== East Country Yard Show ===\\n\\nIn 1990, working together with Sarah Lucas, Bond organised the \"seminal\" Docklands warehouse exhibition of contemporary art East Country Yard Show which was influential in the formation and development of the YBA art movement.\\n\\n\\n==== Critical reception ====\\nIn July 1990, reflecting on the East Country Yard Show and Gambler—a concurrent Goldsmiths-oriented warehouse show—in The Independent, art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon said, \"over the past few months ... in terms of ambition, attention to display and sheer bravado there has been little to match such shows in the country\\'s established contemporary art institutions.\"\\nWriting in Artforum, art critic and curator Kate Bush said, \"[Hirst\\'s] Freeze anticipated a spate of do-it-yourself group shows staged in cheap, sprawling, ex-industrial spaces in recession-hit East London. Bond and Sarah Lucas\\'s East Country Yard Show as well as Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman\\'s Modern Medicine and Gambler, all in 1990, were, with Freeze, the shows that fuelled the myth of YBA as, paradoxically, both oppositional and entrepreneurial.\\nAuthor Keith Patrick said, \"[Following Freeze] many of the same artists showed again two years later in four artist-led exhibitions Modern Medicine, Gambler, the East Country Yard Show and Market ... although Freeze had been poorly attended and barely reviewed, these shows together became a symbol of a new artist-led entrepreneurship, a combination of calculated anarchy and an astute reading of the changing relationship of the artist to the market.\\n\\n\\n=== Exhibit A ===\\n\\nIn 1991, Bond was invited by Julia Peyton-Jones to select an exhibition for the Serpentine Gallery; a curatorial project that became the 7 May – 7 June 1992, exhibition Exhibit A—a show on the theme of evidence and the scene-of-the-crime. One of the works on view was a slide-installation, shown in a darkened room, by artist Mat Collishaw, which presented the viewer with a rapid-fire sequence of stills of Jodie Foster dancing as she appeared in the \"rape scene\", in Jonathan Kaplan\\'s 1988 movie The Accused. Writing in Volume II of the exhibition catalogue, art historian Ian Jeffrey said, \"Exhibit A crystallises a turning in the art world away from the egotistical celebrity mode towards impersonality ... its premises are anonymous, fluent, vertiginous, wary of values.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Selector and screenings ===\\nIn 1990, Bond and fashion photographer Richard Burbridge guest edited a double issue of Creative Camera showcasing emerging British photographers—\"The New New\" issue, October–November 1990; the selection they made included the first published examples of photo-based artworks by Sarah Lucas, Damien Hirst and Angus Fairhurst. Bond\\'s collaboration with the magazine continued as an ongoing series of artists\\' pages that ran as \"openers\"—appearing on the inside front cover and contents page. One spread, created by Hirst, depicted the mutilated corpse of a young man with wounds to the eyes, and was captioned \\'Damien Hirst: Fig. 60 Self-inflicted injuries...\\'; another introduced Fairhurst\\'s self-portrait \\'Man Abandoned by Colour.\\'\\nIn 1993 through 1995, Bond organised a series of screenings of experimental film and video, Omron TV. The screenings were presented in bookable-by-the-hour Soho film preview theatres—including De Lane Lea (Dean Street) and The Soho Screening Rooms (D\\'Arblay Street); the project included presentations of works by Merlin Carpenter, the German artist Lothar Hempel, and the Slovenians Aina Smid and Marina Grzinic.\\n\\n\\n== Visual art practice ==\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, Bond made numerous artworks which used appropriated visual material; in particular a series titled One Hour Photo which presented typical snapshots collected from wastebins of High Street photo-processing labs, across London.\\nBond also exhibited a collaboration with artist Sam Taylor-Wood, titled 26 October 1993, in which he pastiched the role of John Lennon as he had appeared naked, in a photo-portrait with Yoko Ono—shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz—a few hours before he was assassinated.\\nWriting on Bond\\'s art practice, artist and critic Liam Gillick said: \"Bond\\'s art is fundamentally negotiated. No apparently given element of his subject at hand is allowed to proceed while maintaining any sense of an essentialist value. While on the surface his production may appear to re-present lucidly some chosen images of the world around us, it does so with a sceptical relationship to the way meaning is encoded and interpreted by us every day.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Exhibition ===\\nIn the early-1990s, Bond\\'s work was included in two international survey exhibitions of contemporary art at Villa Arson, in Nice, France, No Man\\'s Time in 1991, and Le Principe de réalité in 1993.\\nIn 1995, Bond was included in a group exhibition at the ICA, in London, titled Institute of Cultural Anxiety, in which he presented archival material from the vaults concerning the events at an experimental gig by Einstürzende Neubauten which had taken place at the ICA in January 1984, and during which the group used jackhammers to drill into the stage.\\nIn the mid-1990s, examples of Bond\\'s work were included in Brilliant! a survey of YBA art held at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1995, and Traffic, an exhibition introducing the Relational Aesthetics tendency, which took place at musée d\\'art contemporain de Bordeaux, France, through February and March 1996.\\n\\n\\n=== Other Men\\'s Flowers ===\\nIn 1994, Bond made a work using a letterpress printing press for a portfolio commissioned by Joshua Compston. The portfolio also included works by Gary Hume, Sam Taylor-Wood, and Gavin Turk. The title of the portfolio drew on a quote by the philosopher Montaigne (\"I have gathered a garland of other men\\'s flowers and nothing is mine but the cord that binds them.\"). For his part, Bond supplied a text which describes a series of views in Monaco, written in the style of a tourist guidebook. The portfolio was later acquired by Tate. In 2010, the portfolio was exhibited at the Courtauld Institute. Historian Elizabeth Manchester describes Bond\\'s text as, \"a page entirely filled with text apparently taken from a travel brochure or guide. It describes a fashionable and star-encrusted area in the south of France starting from the peninsula Cap Martin and including the Monte Carlo beach and the Riviera. Names of famous people, places and events, as well as geographical features, are capitalised for emphasis. The amenities provided by hotels, night clubs, casinos, museums and beaches, as well as a fish farm out at sea (producing the luxury fish, sea bass), are all named and occasionally described for the wealthy visitor.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Documents Series with Liam Gillick ===\\n\\nBetween 1990 and 1994, Bond collaborated with artist Liam Gillick on their Documents Series a group of eighty-three fine art works which appropriated the modus operandi of a news gathering team, to produce relational art. To make the work the duo posed as a news reporting team—i.e., a photographer and a journalist—often attending events scheduled in the Press Association\\'s Gazette—a list of potentially newsworthy events in London. Bond worked as if a typical photojournalist, joining the other press photographers present; whilst Gillick operated as the journalist, first collecting the ubiquitous Press kit before preparing his audio recording device.\\n\\n\\n==== Exhibition and collection ====\\nThe series was first shown commercially in 1991, at Karsten Schubert Limited and then, in 1992, at  Maureen Paley\\'s Interim Art —two of the galleries that were pioneers in the development of the YBA art movement.\\nThe duo\\'s series was subsequently exhibited at Tate Modern, in the show Century City held in 2001, and at the Hayward Gallery, in the exhibition How to Improve the World, in 2006.\\nOne example from the series, held in the Arts Council Collection, titled 14 February 1992, documents an auction of the contents of Robert Maxwell\\'s London home at Sotheby\\'s. A further example records the former Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, addressing the Tory Reform Group.\\n\\n\\n=== Video works ===\\nBond\\'s videos are documents of action and events. Writing in his 1998 book Relational Aesthetics, Nicolas Bourriaud said, \"video, for example, is nowadays becoming a predominant medium. But if Peter Land, Gillian Wearing and Henry Bond, to name just three artists, have a preference for video recording, they are still not \\'video artists\\'. This medium merely turns out to be the one best suited to the formalisation of certain activities and projects.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Exhibition ====\\nIn 1993, Bond\\'s short video work OTB was included in Aperto \\'93 at the Venice Biennale—a survey of international contemporary art. The short—which was looped and shown on a multi-screen system—showed grainy black-and-white footage documenting a flâneur\\'s-eye-view of the day-to-day coming and going aboard the plethora of crowded Vaporetto, the waterbuses, in Venice; Bond\\'s deliberately down-to-earth perspective depicting humdrum daily life in the city was intended to oppose the iconic glamorised images of gondolas, etc.\\nBetween 1993 and 1994, \"Bond made eight hours of video footage documenting his walks along the river Thames, resulting in a 26-minute film shown at the Design Museum, reformatted as inserts on Channel One, and finally as a book of stills, Deep, Dark Water.\"\\nFrom July through September 1994, Bond\\'s video works were showcased in an eponymous four-person exhibition at De Appel an art centre in Amsterdam—i.e., Deep, Dark Water (1994), Torch (1993), On the Buses (1993), Hôtel Occidental (1993), Big Shout (1993), The Burglars (1992/4), The Softly Softly (1994), Walked (1994)—which was selected and organised by curator and theorist Saskia Bos (Dean of The School of Art at The Cooper Union, in New York).\\nIn 1995, Bond\\'s video works were included in the Biennale de Lyon survey exhibition.\\n\\n\\n== Fashion photography ==\\nIn the late-1990s and early-2000s, Bond contributed fashion editorial stories to The Face, i-D, Self Service, Purple and the now defunct Nova.\\n\\nOne fashion photograph made by Bond, originally published in the March 2000 issue of The Face, depicted the model Kirsten Owen revealing her panties in a manner typical of the derided and recently criminalised (e.g., in the United States and Australia) voyeuristic \"Uppie\" or Upskirter. In 2001, Bond was chosen by company director Roger Saul to photograph the commercial advertising campaign for a brand relaunch of Mulberry, a leather goods company—for which he used actors and celebrity couple David Thewlis and Anna Friel, as models. Thewlis and Friel were reported to have been paid £50,000 to appear in the campaign.\\nIn 2008, examples of Bond\\'s fashion photographs from this period were included in an international survey exhibition of contemporary photography selected by Urs Stahel, Darkside: Photographic Desire and Sexuality Photographed, held at Fotomuseum Winterthur—the Swiss national museum and collection of photography.\\n\\n\\n== Asperger\\'s diagnosis ==\\nBond has stated that he is a person with autism – specifically Asperger\\'s Syndrome. He has had both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychoanalysis for this condition. In an article in The Guardian in 2012, Bond questioned the use of psychoanalysis with autistic children in France.\\n\\n\\n== Published works ==\\nNon-fiction\\n\\nThe Gaze of the Lens (Seattle: Amazon KDP, 2011)\\nLacan at the Scene (Slavoj Žižek, series ed., Short Circuits; Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009)\\nPhotography monographs\\n\\nInteriors Series (Antwerp: Fotomuseum, 2005)\\nWhat gets you through the day (London: Art Data/Lavie, 2002)\\nPoint and Shoot (Ostfildern: Cantz, 2000)\\nLa vie quotidienne (Essen: 20/21, 1999)\\nThe Cult of the Street (London: Emily Tsingou Gallery, 1998)\\nDocuments (London: APAC/Karsten Schubert Limited, 1991)\\n100 Photographs (Farnham, Surrey: James Hockey Gallery, 1990)\\nDocumentation of video works\\n\\nSafe Surfer (Lyon, France: Biennale de Lyon, 1995)\\n Deep, Dark Water (London: Public Art Development Trust, 1994)\\nHôtel Occidental (Nice, France: Villa Arson, 1993)\\nEdited books\\n\\nHenry Bond and Sarah Lucas, East Country Yard Show (London: East Country Yard, 1990)\\nHenry Bond and Andrea Schlieker, Exhibit A (London: Serpentine Gallery, 1992)\\nEssays in edited books\\n\\n\"The Hysterical Hystery of Photography.\" In Urs Stahel (ed.), Darkside I: Photographic Desire and Sexuality Photographed, (Göttingen, Germany: Steidl, 2008)\\n\"Comments on this Series.\" In Christoph Ruys (ed.), Henry Bond: Interiors Series (Antwerp, Belgium: Fotomuseum, 2005)\\n\"Montage My Fine Care: Five Themes with Examples.\" In Henry Bond & Andrea Schlieker (ed.), Exhibit A (London: Serpentine Gallery, 1992)\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nLegality of recording by civilians\\nModel release\\nPhotography and the law\\nPublic domain\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nList of books by Henry Bond held at the National Art Library, England.\\nArtist\\'s personal website: Henry Bond\\nTamsin Blanchard article\\nInterview on Saatchi Blog with Anna Honigman\\nWalker Art Center press release\\nFacsimile invitation card to The Cult of the Street exhibition at Emily Tsingou Gallery, 13 May – 27 June 1998.\\nExample from The Cult of the Street in the Swiss national photography collection at Fotomuseum, Winterthur.\\nFrieze review\\nFacsimile of invitation card to Point and Shoot exhibition at Emily Tsingou Gallery, 9 May to 30 June 2000.\\nLacan at the Scene\\nLink to Zizek foreword .pdf\\nLacan at the Scene/MIT Press catalogue page\\nReview by Adam Atkinson',\n",
              "  'Paola Pivi (born 1971) is an Italian multimedia artist.\\nShe has worked in artistic media including photography, sculpture and installation. Some of her works contain performance elements, at times involving live animals and people. In 1999, she received the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale. Examples of her work are in public collections including those of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and MAXXI in Rome.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
              "  'Ida Applebroog (November 11, 1929 – October 21, 2023) was an American multi-media artist who was best-known for her paintings and sculptures that explore the themes of gender, sexual identity, violence, and politics. Applebroog was the recipient of multiple honors including the MacArthur Fellowship \"Genius Grant\", the College Art Association Distinguished Art Award for Lifetime Achievement, and an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the New School for Social Research/Parsons School of Design. Applebroog lived in New York City and is represented by Hauser & Wirth.\\n\\n\\n== Life and work ==\\nIda Applebroog was born as Ida Appelbaum on November 11, 1929, in the Bronx, New York, into an ultra-Orthodox Jewish family. From 1948 to 1950, she attended NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences. At the Institute, she studied graphic design rather than fine art. Applebroog stated that she, \"couldn\\'t make art without also making money.\" While studying at NY State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, she began to work at an advertising agency where she was the only woman. Applebroog later recounted, \"In those days sexual harassment was a day-to-day event. I held out in the ad agency for six months, then resigned.\"\\nAfter resigning from the advertising agency, Applebroog went on to work as a freelance illustrator for children\\'s books and greeting cards. In 1950, she married Gideon Horowitz, her high school sweetheart. She took a job in the art division of the New York Public Library. She also began to take night classes at City College of New York during this time. By 1960, Applebroog had four children and in order for her husband to complete his doctorate, Applebroog and her family had to move to Chicago. After moving to Chicago Applebroog took courses at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and made jewelry in her family\\'s basement that her husband and children would sell at art fairs.\\nIn 1968 Applebroog and her family relocated again to Southern California where her husband accepted an academic position. While living in San Diego, California, Applebroog began sketching close-ups of her own naked body, specifically her crotch, while in the bathtub, a series of more than 150 works she would not exhibit until 2010. In 1969 Applebroog was briefly hospitalized for depression, during which time she began making bathtub sketches. She was released by 1970 and promptly began to continue making art in her studio in San Diego. Once she returned from her hospitalization, she began to create sculptures of \"biomorphic forms made from fabric\" amongst much other art. At the age of forty-four she participated in one of her earliest group exhibitions, entitled Invisible/Visible in 1972 at Long Beach Museum of Art.\\nThe following year Applebroog went to the Feminist Artists Conference at California Institute of the Arts, where she spoke with many women artists and was highly influenced by their enthusiasm toward social activism in art. Applebroog moved back to New York City in 1974. It was there, after changing her name from \"Ida Horowitz\" to \"Ida Applebroog\" (based on her maiden name, Applebaum), where she began to develop her own signature artistic style with a series of cartoonlike figures that merged the comic-strip format with the advertising industry\\'s use of story-boards to explain a concept.\\nStarting in 1977 she circulated a series of self-published books through the mail, and joined Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics, alongside feminist curators and artists such as Lucy R. Lippard and May Stevens, among others. In 1981 she showed Applebroog: Silent Stagings, her first exhibition at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts in New York City, where she continued to show for over 20 years. Applebroog stated that the subject of her work is \"how power works--male over female, parents over children, governments over people, doctors over patients.\"\\nIn 2005 she was profiled in the PBS documentary Art 21: Art in the Twenty-first Century. In 2010, Applebroog\\'s works on paper, including her 1969 sketches, were exhibited in a solo show entitled Ida Applebroog: Monalisa at Hauser & Wirth in New York City, and in 2011 at Hauser & Wirth in London. In 2016 Applebroog was the subject of the documentary Call Her Applebroog, directed by her daughter Beth B.\\nIn 2020, Ida Applebroog\\'s work was included in a major group show at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida. My Body, My Rules, presented an investigation about the diverse artistic practices of 23 female-identified artists in the 21st-century. Louise Bourgeois, Carolee Schneemann, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Ana Mendieta, Wanguechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas, and Francesca Woodman, were also among them.\\nIda Applebroog died on October 21, 2023, at the age of 93.\\n\\n\\n== Selected works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\nGalileo Works, 1977, Self Published\\nDyspepsia Works, 1979, Self Published\\nBlue Books, 1981, Self Published\\n\\n\\n=== Images from exhibitions ===\\ndOCUMENTA (13) Images from the exhibition\\n\\n\\n== Select public collections ==\\nThe Corcoran Museum of Art\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art\\nMuseum of Modern Art\\nGuggenheim Museum\\nWhitney Museum of Art\\n\\n\\n== Awards and grants ==\\nArtist\\'s Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1980\\nCreative Artists in Public Service Program, New York State Council on the Arts, 1983\\nArtist\\'s Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts, 1985\\nGuggenheim Fellowship, 1990\\nMilton Avery Distinguished Chair, Bard College, 1991–92\\nLifetime Achievement Award, College Art Association, 1995\\nHonorary Doctorate, New School University/Parsons School of Design, 1997\\nMacArthur Foundation Fellowship, 1998\\nWomen\\'s Caucus for Art Lifetime Achievement Award, 2008\\nAnonymous Was A Woman Award, 2009\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nIda Applebroog, \"Ida Applebroog: Monalisa\" (Hardcover) 2010.

              "  'Ai Weiwei (  EYE way-WAY; Chinese: 艾未未; pinyin: Ài Wèiwèi, IPA: [âɪ wêɪ.wêɪ]; born 28 August 1957) is a Chinese contemporary artist, documentarian, and activist. Ai grew up in the far northwest of China, where he lived under harsh conditions due to his father\\'s exile. As an activist, he has been openly critical of the Chinese Government\\'s stance on democracy and human rights. He investigated government corruption and cover-ups, in particular the Sichuan schools corruption scandal following the collapse of \"tofu-dreg schools\" in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. In April 2011, Ai Weiwei was arrested at Beijing Capital International Airport for \"economic crimes,\" and detained for 81 days without charge. Ai Weiwei emerged as a vital instigator in Chinese cultural development, an architect of Chinese modernism, and one of the nation\\'s most vocal political commentators.\\nAi Weiwei encapsulates political conviction and poetry in his many sculptures, photographs, and public works. Since being allowed to leave China in 2015, he has lived in Portugal, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and work ===\\nAi\\'s father was the Chinese poet Ai Qing, who was denounced during the Anti-Rightist Movement. In 1958, the family was sent to a labour camp in Beidahuang, Heilongjiang, when Ai was one year old. They were subsequently exiled to Shihezi, Xinjiang in 1961, where they lived for 16 years. Upon Mao Zedong\\'s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the family returned to Beijing in 1976.\\nIn 1978, Ai enrolled in the Beijing Film Academy and studied animation. In 1978, he was one of the founders of the early avant garde art group the \"Stars\", together with Ma Desheng, Wang Keping, Mao Lizi, Huang Rui, Li Shuang, Ah Cheng and Qu Leilei. The group disbanded in 1983, yet Ai participated in regular Stars group shows, The Stars: Ten Years, 1989 (Hanart Gallery, Hong Kong and Taipei), and a retrospective exhibition in Beijing in 2007: Origin Point (Today Art Museum, Beijing). \\n\\n\\n=== Life in the United States ===\\n\\nFrom 1981 to 1993, he lived in the United States. He was among the first generation of students to study abroad following China\\'s reform in 1980, being one of the 161 students to take the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) in 1981. For the first few years, Ai lived in Philadelphia and San Francisco. He studied English at the University of Pennsylvania and the Berkeley Adult School. Later, he moved to New York City. He studied briefly at Parsons School of Design. Ai attended the Art Students League of New York from 1983 to 1986, where he studied with Bruce Dorfman, Knox Martin and Richard Pousette-Dart. He later dropped out of school and made a living out of drawing street portraits and working odd jobs. During this period, he gained exposure to the works of Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns, and began creating conceptual art by altering readymade objects.\\nAi befriended beat poet Allen Ginsberg while living in New York, following a chance meeting at a poetry reading where Ginsberg read out several poems about China. Ginsberg had traveled to China and met with Ai\\'s father, the noted poet Ai Qing, and consequently Ginsberg and Ai became friends.\\nWhen he was living in the East Village (from 1983 to 1993), Ai carried a camera with him all the time and would take pictures of his surroundings wherever he was. The resulting collection of photos were later selected and is now known as the New York Photographs. At the same time, Ai became fascinated by blackjack card games and frequented Atlantic City casinos. He is still regarded in gambling circles as a top tier professional blackjack player according to an article published on blackjackchamp.com.\\n\\n\\n=== Return to China ===\\nIn 1993, Ai returned to China after his father became ill. He helped establish the experimental artists\\' Beijing East Village and co-published a series of three books about this new generation of artists with Chinese curator Feng Boyi: Black Cover Book (1994), White Cover Book (1995), and Gray Cover Book (1997).\\nIn 1999, Ai moved to Caochangdi, in the northeast of Beijing, and built a studio house—his first architectural project. Due to his interest in architecture, he founded the architecture studio FAKE Design, in 2003. In 2000, he co-curated the art exhibition Fuck Off with curator Feng Boyi in Shanghai, China.\\n\\n\\n=== Life in Europe ===\\nIn 2011, Ai was arrested in China on charges of tax evasion, jailed for 81 days, and then released. The government had confiscated his passport and refused him any other travel papers. Following the return of his passport in 2015, Ai moved to Berlin where he maintained a large studio in a former brewery. He lived in the studio and used it as the base for his international work.\\nIn 2019, he announced he would be leaving Berlin, saying that Germany is not an open culture. In September 2019, he moved to live in Cambridge, England.\\nAs of 2023, Ai lives in Montemor-o-Novo, Portugal. He still maintains a base in Cambridge, where his son attends school, and a studio in Berlin. Ai says he will stay in Portugal long-term \"unless something happens\".\\nAi sits on the Board of Advisors for the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong (CFHK).\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nAi is married to artist Lu Qing. He has a son, Ai Lao, born 2009 with Wang Fen. Ai is fond of cats.\\n\\n\\n== Political activity and controversies ==\\n\\n\\n=== Internet activities ===\\nIn 2005, Ai was invited to start blogging by Sina Weibo, the biggest internet platform in China. He posted his first blog on 19 November. For four years, he \"turned out a steady stream of scathing social commentary, criticism of government policy, thoughts on art and architecture, and autobiographical writings.\" The blog was shut down by Sina on 28 May 2009. Ai then turned to Twitter and wrote prolifically on the platform, claiming at least eight hours online every day. He wrote almost exclusively in Chinese using the account @aiww. As of 31 December 2013, Ai has declared that he would stop tweeting but the account remains active in forms of retweets and Instagram posts. In 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Ai\\'s blog as the fourth greatest work of performance art ever, with the writer arguing, \"Much in the way early performance artists documented with film and video, Ai used the prevalent medium of his time—the web—to examine the increasingly fine line between public life and the artist\\'s work. Ai here used his presence to create something full and tangible rather than just a symbolic representation of his critique.\" In 2023, he created a mobile app to which gives users a picture of Ai\\'s own middle finger which they can insert over another image of any place on earth (from google earth) which they disapprove of.\\n\\n\\n=== Citizens\\' investigation on Sichuan earthquake student casualties ===\\nTen days after the 8.0-magnitude earthquake in Sichuan province on 12 May 2008, Ai led a team to survey and film the post-quake conditions in various disaster zones. In response to the government\\'s lack of transparency in revealing names of students who perished in the earthquake due to substandard school campus constructions, Ai recruited volunteers online and launched a \"Citizens\\' Investigation\" to compile names and information of the student victims. On 20 March 2009, he posted a blog titled \"Citizens\\' Investigation\" and wrote: \"To remember the departed, to show concern for life, to take responsibility, and for the potential happiness of the survivors, we are initiating a \\'Citizens\\' Investigation.\\' We will seek out the names of each departed child, and we will remember them.\"\\nAs of 14 April 2009, the list had accumulated 5,385 names. Ai published the collected names as well as numerous articles documenting the investigation on his blog which was shut down by Chinese authorities in May 2009. He also posted his list of names of schoolchildren who died on the wall of his office at FAKE Design in Beijing.\\nAi suffered headaches and claimed he had difficulty concentrating on his work since returning from Chengdu in August 2009, where he was beaten by the police for trying to testify for Tan Zuoren, a fellow investigator of the shoddy construction and student casualties in the earthquake. On 14 September 2009, Ai was diagnosed to be suffering internal bleeding in a hospital in Munich, Germany, and the doctor arranged for emergency brain surgery. The cerebral hemorrhage is believed to be linked to the police attack.\\nAccording to the Financial Times, in an attempt to force Ai to leave the country, two accounts used by him had been hacked in a sophisticated attack on Google in China dubbed Operation Aurora, their contents read and copied; his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\".\\n\\n\\n=== Shanghai studio controversy ===\\nAi was placed under house arrest in November 2010 by the Chinese police. He said this was to prevent the planned party marking the demolition of his brand new Shanghai studio.\\nThe building was designed by Ai himself with assistance, and potency coming from a \"high official [from Shanghai]\" the new studio was a part of a new traditionally design by Shanghai Municipal jurisdiction. He was going to use it as a studio and mentor different architecture courses. After Ai was charged with constructing the studio without the required approval and the knockdown notice had been processed, Ai said officials had been anxious and the paperwork and planning process was \"under government supervision\". According to Ai, a few different artists were invited to create and structure new studios in this area of Shanghai because officials wanted to create a friendly environment.\\nAi stated on 3 November 2010 that authorities had let him know him two months earlier that the newly completed studio would be knocked down because it was illegal and did not meet the needs. Ai criticized that this was biased, stating that he was \"the only one singled out to have my studio destroyed\". The Guardian reported Ai saying Shanghai municipal authorities were \"upset \" by documentaries on subjects they considered delicate—in particular a documentary featuring Shanghai resident Feng Zhenghu, who lived in forced separation for three months in Narita Airport, Tokyo, and one focused on Yang Jia, who murdered six Shanghai police officers.\\nAt the end of the term, the gathering took place without Ai. All of his fans had a river crab, an allusion to \"harmony\", and a euphemism used to jeer official censorship. Ai was eventually released from house arrest the next day.\\nLike other activists and intellectuals, Ai was stopped from leaving China in late 2010. Ai suggested that the higher ups wanted to stop him from attending a ceremony in December 2010 to award the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to fellow dissident Liu Xiaobo. Ai said that he was never invited to the ceremony and was attempting to travel to South Korea where he had an important meeting when he was told that he could not leave for reasons of national security.\\nOn 11 January 2011, Ai\\'s studio was knocked down and destroyed in a surprise move by the government, who had previously told him the studio would be destroyed only after the beginning of the New Year on 3 February 2011.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011 arrest ===\\nOn 3 April 2011, Ai was arrested at Beijing Capital International Airport just before catching a flight to Hong Kong and his studio facilities were searched. A police contingent of approximately 50 officers came to his studio, threw a cordon around it and searched the premises. They took away laptops and the hard drive from the main computer; along with Ai, police also detained eight staff members and Ai\\'s wife, Lu Qing. Police also visited the mother of Ai\\'s two-year-old son. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on 7 April that Ai was arrested under investigation for alleged economic crimes. Then, on 8 April, police returned to Ai\\'s workshop to examine his financial affairs. Ai\\'s assistant Wen Tao, studio partner Liu Zhenggang and driver Zhang Jingsong were also detained following Ai\\'s arrest. Ai\\'s wife said that she was summoned by the Beijing Chaoyang district tax bureau, where she was interrogated about his studio\\'s tax on 12 April. South China Morning Post reports that Ai received at least two visits from the police, the last being on 31 March—three days before his detention—apparently with offers of membership to the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference. A staff member recalled that Ai had mentioned receiving the offer earlier, \"[but Ai] didn\\'t say if it was a membership of the CPPCC at the municipal or national level, how he responded or whether he accepted it or not.\"\\nOn 24 February, amid an online campaign for Middle East-style protests in major Chinese cities by overseas dissidents, Ai posted on his Twitter account: \"I didn\\'t care about jasmine at first, but people who are scared by jasmine sent out information about how harmful jasmine is often, which makes me realize that jasmine is what scares them the most. What a jasmine!\"\\n\\n\\n==== Response to Ai\\'s arrest ====\\n\\nAnalysts and other activists said Ai had been widely thought to be untouchable, but Nicholas Bequelin from Human Rights Watch suggested that his arrest was calculated to send a message that no one is immune and that the arrest must have had the approval of someone in the top leadership. International governments, human rights groups and art institutions, among others, called for Ai\\'s release, while Chinese officials did not notify Ai\\'s family of his whereabouts. State media started describing Ai as a \"deviant and a plagiarist\" in early 2011.\\n\\nMichael Sheridan of The Australian suggested that Ai had offered himself to the authorities on a platter with some of his provocative art, particularly photographs of himself nude with only a toy alpaca hiding his modesty – with a caption『草泥马挡中央』 (\"grass mud horse covering the middle\"). The term possesses a double meaning in Chinese: one possible interpretation was given by Sheridan as: \"Fuck your mother, the party central committee\".\\nMing Pao in Hong Kong reacted strongly to the state media\\'s character attack on Ai, saying that authorities had employed \"a chain of actions outside the law, doing further damage to an already weak system of laws, and to the overall image of the country.\" Pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, Wen Wei Po, announced that Ai was under arrest for tax evasion, bigamy and spreading indecent images on the internet, and vilified him with multiple instances of strong rhetoric. Supporters said, \"the article should be seen as a mainland media commentary attacking Ai, rather than as an accurate account of the investigation.\"\\nThe United States and European Union protested Ai\\'s detention. The international arts community also mobilised petitions calling for the release of Ai: \"1001 Chairs for Ai Weiwei\" was organized by Creative Time of New York that calls for artists to bring chairs to Chinese embassies and consulates around the world on 17 April 2011, at 1 pm local time \"to sit peacefully in support of the artist\\'s immediate release.\" Artists in Hong Kong, Germany and Taiwan demonstrated and called for Ai to be released.\\nOne of the major protests by U.S. museums took place on 19 and 20 May when the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego organized a 24-hour silent protest in which volunteer participants, including community members, media, and museum staff, occupied two traditionally styled Chinese chairs for one-hour periods. The 24-hour sit-in referenced Ai\\'s sculpture series Marble Chair, two of which were on view and were subsequently acquired for the museum\\'s permanent collection.\\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and the International Council of Museums, which organised petitions, said they had collected more than 90,000 signatures calling for the release of Ai. On 13 April 2011, a group of European intellectuals led by Václav Havel had issued an open letter to Wen Jiabao, condemning the arrest and demanding the immediate release of Ai. The signatories include Ivan Klíma, Jiří Gruša, Jáchym Topol, Elfriede Jelinek, Adam Michnik, Adam Zagajewski, Helmuth Frauendorfer; Bei Ling (Chinese:贝岭), a Chinese poet in exile drafted and also signed the open letter.\\nOn 16 May 2011, the Chinese authorities allowed Ai\\'s wife to visit him briefly. Liu Xiaoyuan, his attorney and personal friend, reported that Wei was in good physical condition and receiving treatment for his chronic diabetes and hypertension; he was not in a prison or hospital but under some form of house arrest.\\nHe is the subject of the 2012 documentary film Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, directed by American filmmaker Alison Klayman, which received a special jury prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and opened the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, North America\\'s largest documentary festival, in Toronto on 26 April 2012.\\n\\n\\n==== Release ====\\nOn 22 June 2011, the Chinese authorities released Ai from jail after almost three months\\' detention on charges of tax evasion. Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. (Chinese: 北京发课文化公司), a company Ai controlled, had allegedly evaded taxes and intentionally destroyed accounting documents. State media also reports that Ai was granted bail on account of Ai\\'s \"good attitude in confessing his crimes\", willingness to pay back taxes, and his chronic illnesses. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, he was prohibited from leaving Beijing without permission for one year. Ai\\'s supporters widely viewed his detention as retaliation for his vocal criticism of the government. On 23 June 2011, professor Wang Yujin of China University of Political Science and Law stated that the release of Ai on bail shows that the Chinese government could not find any solid evidence of Ai\\'s alleged \"economic crime\". On 24 June 2011, Ai told a Radio Free Asia reporter that he was thankful for the support of the Hong Kong public, and praised Hong Kong\\'s conscious society. Ai also mentioned that his detention by the Chinese regime was hellish (Chinese: 九死一生), and stressed that he is forbidden to say too much to reporters.\\nAfter his release, his sister gave some details about his detention condition to the press, explaining that he was subjected to a kind of psychological torture: he was detained in a tiny room with constant light, and two guards were set very close to him at all times, and watched him constantly. In November, Chinese authorities were again investigating Ai and his associates, this time under the charge of spreading pornography.\\nLu was subsequently questioned by police, and released after several hours though the exact charges remain unclear.\\nIn January 2012, in its International Review issue Art in America magazine featured an interview with Ai Weiwei at his home in China. J.J. Camille (the pen name of a Chinese-born writer living in New York), \"neither a journalist nor an activist but simply an art lover who wanted to talk to him\" had travelled to Beijing the previous September to conduct the interview and to write about his visit to \"China\\'s most famous dissident artist\" for the magazine.\\nOn 21 June 2012, Ai\\'s bail was lifted. Although he was allowed to leave Beijing, the police informed him that he was still prohibited from traveling to other countries because he is \"suspected of other crimes\", including pornography, bigamy and illicit exchange of foreign currency. Until 2015, he remained under heavy surveillance and restrictions of movement, but continued to criticize through his work. In July 2015, he was given a passport and permitted to travel abroad.\\nAi says that at the beginning of his detention he was proud of being detained much like his father had been earlier. He also says it allowed him to try a dialogue with the authorities, something which had never been possible before.\\n\\n\\n=== Tax case ===\\nIn June 2011, the Beijing Local Taxation Bureau demanded a total of over 12 million yuan (US$1.85 million) from Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. in unpaid taxes and fines, and accorded three days to appeal the demand in writing. According to Ai\\'s wife, Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. has hired two Beijing lawyers as defense attorneys. Ai\\'s family state that Ai is \"neither the chief executive nor the legal representative of the design company, which is registered in his wife\\'s name.\"\\nOffers of donations poured in from Ai\\'s fans across the world when the fine was announced. Eventually, an online loan campaign was initiated on 4 November 2011, and close to 9 million RMB was collected within ten days, from 30,000 contributions. Notes were folded into paper planes and thrown over the studio walls, and donations were made in symbolic amounts such as 8964 (4 June 1989, Tiananmen Massacre) or 512 (12 May 2008, Sichuan earthquake). To thank creditors and acknowledge the contributions as loans, Ai designed and issued loan receipts to all who participated in the campaign. Funds raised from the campaign were used as collateral, required by law for an appeal on the tax case. Lawyers acting for Ai submitted an appeal against the fine in January 2012; the Chinese government subsequently agreed to conduct a review.\\nIn June 2012, the court heard the tax appeal case. Ai\\'s wife, Lu Qing, the legal representative of the design company, attended the hearing. Lu was accompanied by several lawyers and an accountant, but the witnesses they had requested to testify, including Ai, were prevented from attending a court hearing. Ai asserts that the entire matter—including the 81 days he spent in jail in 2011—is intended to suppress his provocations. Ai said he had no illusions as to how the case would turn out, as he believes the court will protect the government\\'s own interests. On 20 June, hundreds of Ai\\'s supporters gathered outside the Chaoyang District Court in Beijing despite a small army of police officers, some of whom videotaped the crowd and led several people away. On 20 July, Ai\\'s tax appeal was rejected in court. The same day Ai\\'s studio released \"The Fake Case\" which tracks the status and history of this case including a timeline and the release of official documents. On 27 September, the court upheld the back taxes and fines totaling RMB 15.52 million (US$2.4 million). Ai had previously deposited 1.33 million in a government-controlled account in order to appeal. Ai said he will not pay the remainder because he does not recognize the charge.\\nIn October 2012, authorities revoked the license of Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. for failing to re-register, an annual requirement by the administration. The company was not able to complete this procedure as its materials and stamps were confiscated by the government.\\n\\n\\n=== \"15 Years of Chinese Contemporary Art Award (CCAA)\" – Power Station of Art, Shanghai, 2014 ===\\nOn 26 April 2014, Ai\\'s name was removed from a group show taking place at the Shanghai Power Station of Art. The exhibition was held to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the art prize created by Uli Sigg in 1998, with the purpose of promoting and developing Chinese contemporary art. Ai won the Lifetime Contribution Award in 2008 and was part of the jury during the first three editions of the prize. He was then invited to take part in the group show together with the other selected Chinese artists. Shortly before the exhibition\\'s opening, some museum workers removed his name from the list of winners and jury members painted on a wall. Also, Ai\\'s works Sunflower Seeds and Stools were removed from the show and kept in a museum office. Sigg declared that it was not his decision and that it was a decision of the Power Station of Art and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture.\\n\\n\\n=== \"Hans van Dijk: 5000 Names – UCCA\" ===\\nIn May 2014, the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, a non-profit art center situated in the 798 art district of Beijing, held a retrospective exhibition in honor of the late curator and scholar, Hans Van Dijk. Ai, a good friend of Hans and a fellow co-founder of the China Art Archives and Warehouse (CAAW), participated in the exhibition with three artworks. On the day of the opening, Ai realized his name was omitted from both Chinese and English versions of the exhibition\\'s press release. Ai\\'s assistants went to the art center and removed his works. It is Ai\\'s belief that, in omitting his name, the museum altered the historical record of van Dijk\\'s work with him. Ai started his own research about what actually happened, and between 23 and 25 May he interviewed the UCCA\\'s director, Philip Tinari, the guest curator of the exhibition, Marianne Brouwer, and the UCCA chief, Xue Mei. He published the transcripts of the interviews on Instagram. In one of the interviews, the CEO of the UCCA, Xue Mei, admitted that, due to the sensitive time of the exhibition, Ai\\'s name was taken out of the press releases on the day of the opening and it was supposed to be restored afterwards. This was to avoid problems with the Chinese authorities, who threatened to arrest her.\\n\\n\\n=== Support for Julian Assange ===\\nAi has long advocated for the release of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. In 2016, he co-signed a letter which stated that the UK and Sweden were undermining the UN by ignoring the findings of a UN working group that found Assange was being arbitrarily detained. The letter called on the UK and Sweden to guarantee Assange\\'s freedom of movement and provide compensation. Ai visited Assange in high security Belmarsh Prison after his arrest by the UK. In September 2019, Ai held a silent protest in support of Assange outside London\\'s Old Bailey court where Assange\\'s extradition hearing was being held. Ai called for Assange\\'s freedom and said \"He truly represents the very core value of why we are fighting, the freedom of the press.\"\\nIn 2021, Ai was invited to submit a piece for the virtual UK art exhibition The Great Big Art Exhibition, which was organised by Firstsite. Ai\\'s piece, called Postcard for Political Prisoners, incorporated a photograph of the running machine used by Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy. After initially accepting Ai\\'s idea, Firstsite\\'s director said that it could not include his project \"due to time constraints, and because it did not fit with the concept of the exhibition.\" Ai said he thought the reason for the rejection was that the exhibition did not \"want to touch on a topic like Assange.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===\\nIn November 2023, Ai Weiwei\\'s exhibition at the Lisson Gallery in London was postponed indefinitely after he tweeted about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict that \"the sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world. Financially, culturally, and in terms of media influence, the Jewish community has had a significant presence in the United States\". He criticized the suspension of two New York University professors for comments regarding Israel\\'s actions in the Gaza Strip, saying \"This is really like a cultural revolution, which is really trying to destroy anybody who have different attitudes, not even a clear opinion.\"\\n\\n\\n== Artistic works ==\\n\\nAi has been called China\\'s most famous artist. He has created works that focus on human rights abuses using video, photography, wallpaper, and porcelain.\\n\\n\\n=== Documentaries ===\\nBeijing video works\\nFrom 2003 to 2005, Ai Weiwei recorded the results of Beijing\\'s developing urban infrastructure and its social conditions.\\n\\n\\n==== Beijing 2003 ====\\n2003, Video, 150 hours\\nBeginning under the Dabeiyao highway interchange, the vehicle from which Beijing 2003 was shot traveled every road within the Fourth Ring Road of Beijing and documented the road conditions. Approximately 2400 kilometers and 150 hours of footage later, it ended where it began under the Dabeiyao highway interchange. The documentation of these winding alleyways of the city center – now largely torn down for redevelopment – preserved a visual record of the city that is free of aesthetic judgment.\\n\\n\\n==== Chang\\'an Boulevard ====\\n2004, Video, 10h 13m\\nMoving from east to west, Chang\\'an Boulevard traverses Beijing\\'s most iconic avenue. Along the boulevard\\'s 45-kilometer length, it recorded the changing densities of its far-flung suburbs, central business districts, and political core. At each 50-meter increment, the artist records a single frame for one minute. The work reveals the rhythm of Beijing as a capital city, its social structure, cityscape, socialist-planned economy, capitalist market, political power center, commercial buildings, and industrial units as pieces of a multi-layered urban collage.\\n\\n\\n==== Beijing: The Second Ring ====\\n2005, Video, 1h 6m\\n\\n\\n==== Beijing: The Third Ring ====\\n2005 Video, 1h 50m\\nBeijing: The Second Ring and Beijing: The Third Ring capture two opposite views of traffic flow on every bridge of each Ring Road, the innermost arterial highways of Beijing. The artist records a single frame for one minute for each view on the bridge. Beijing: The Second Ring was entirely shot on cloudy days, while the segments for Beijing: The Third Ring were entirely shot on sunny days. The films document the historic aspects and modern development of a city with a population of nearly 11 million people.\\n\\n\\n==== Fairytale ====\\n2007, video, 2h 32m\\nFairytale covers Ai Weiwei\\'s project Fairytale, part of Europe\\'s most innovative five-year art event Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany in 2007. Ai invited 1001 Chinese citizens of different ages and from various backgrounds to travel to Kassel, Germany to experience a fairytale of their own.\\nThe 152-minute long film documents the ideation and process of staging Fairytale and covering project preparations, participants\\' challenges, and travel to Germany.\\nAlong with this documentary, Fairytale was documented through written materials and photographs of participants and artifacts from the event.\\nFairytale was an act of social subversion, improving relationships between China and the West through interactions among participants and the citizens of Kassel. Ai Weiwei felt that he was able to make a positive influence on both participants of Fairytale and Kassel citizens.\\n\\n\\n==== Little Girl\\'s Cheeks ====\\n2008, video, 1h 18m\\nOn 15 December 2008, a citizens\\' investigation began with the goal of seeking an explanation for the casualties of the Sichuan earthquake that happened on 12 May 2008. The investigation covered 14 counties and 74 townships within the disaster zone and studied the conditions of 153 schools that were affected by the earthquake. By gathering and confirming comprehensive details about the students, such as their age, region, school, and grade, the group managed to affirm that there were 5,192 students who perished in the disaster. Among a hundred volunteers, 38 of them participated in fieldwork, with 25 of them being controlled by the Sichuan police for a total of 45 times. This documentary is a structural element of the citizens\\' investigation.\\n\\n\\n==== 4851 ====\\n2009, looped video, 1h 27m\\nAt 14:28 on 12 May 2008, an 8.0-magnitude earthquake happened in Sichuan, China. Over 5,000 students in primary and secondary schools perished in the earthquake, yet their names went unannounced. In reaction to the government\\'s lack of transparency, a citizen\\'s investigation was initiated to find out their names and details about their schools and families. As of 2 September 2009, there were 4,851 confirmed. This video is a tribute to these perished students and a memorial for innocent lives lost.\\n\\n\\n==== A Beautiful Life ====\\n2009, video, 48m\\nThis video documents the story of Chinese citizen Feng Zhenghu and his struggles to return home.\\nIn 2009, authorities in Shanghai prevented Feng Zhenghu, who was originally from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, from returning home a total of eight times that year. On 4 November 2009 Feng Zhenghu attempted to return home for the ninth time but instead Chinese police forcibly put him on a flight to Japan. Upon arrival at Narita Airport outside of Tokyo, Feng refused to enter Japan and decided to live in the Immigration Hall at Terminal 1, as an act of protest. He relied on gifts of food from tourists for sustenance and lived in a passageway in the Narita Airport for 92 days. He posted updates over Twitter which attracted international media coverage and concern from Chinese netizens and international communities.\\nOn 31 January, Feng announced an end to his protest at the Narita Airport. On 12 February Feng was allowed to re-enter China, where he reunited with his family at their home in Shanghai. Ai Weiwei and his assistant Gao Yuan, went from Beijing to interview Feng Zhenghu three times at Narita Airport, on 16 November, 20 November 2009 and 31 January 2010 and documented his stay in the airport passageway and the entire process of his return to China.\\n\\n\\n==== Disturbing the Peace (Laoma Tihua) ====\\n2009, video, 1h 19m\\nAi Weiwei studio production Laoma Tihua is a documentary of an incident during Tan Zuoren\\'s trial on 12 August 2009. Tan Zuoren was charged with \"inciting subversion of state power\". Chengdu police detained witnessed during the trial of the civil rights advocate, which is an obstruction of justice and violence. Tan Zuoren was charged as a result of his research and questioning regarding the 5.12 Wenchuan students\\' casualties and the corruption resulting poor building construction. Tan Zuoren was sentenced to five years of prison.\\n\\n\\n==== One Recluse ====\\n2010, video, 3h\\nIn June 2008, Yang Jia carried a knife, a hammer, a gas mask, pepper spray, gloves and Molotov cocktails to the Zhabei Public Security Branch Bureau and killed six police officers, injuring another police officer and a guard. He was arrested on the scene and was subsequently charged with intentional homicide. In the following six months, while Yang Jia was detained and trials were held, his mother has mysteriously disappeared. This video is a documentary that traces the reasons and motivations behind the tragedy and investigates into a trial process filled with shady cover-ups and questionable decisions. The film provides a glimpse into the realities of a government-controlled judicial system and its impact on the citizens\\' lives.\\n\\n\\n==== Hua Hao Yue Yuan ====\\n2010, video, 2h 6m\\n\"The future dictionary definition of \\'crackdown\\' will be: First cover one\\'s head up firmly, and then beat him or her up violently\". – @aiww\\nIn the summer of 2010, the Chinese government began a crackdown on dissent, and Hua Hao Yue Yuan documents the stories of Liu Dejun and Liu Shasha, whose activism and outspoken attitude led them to violent abuse from the authorities. On separate occasions, they were kidnapped, beaten and thrown into remote locations. The incidents attracted much concern over the Internet, as well as wide speculation and theories about what exactly happened. This documentary presents interviews of the two victims, witnesses and concerned netizens. In which it gathers various perspectives about the two beatings and brings us closer to the brutal reality of China\\'s \"crackdown on crime\".\\n\\n\\n==== Remembrance ====\\n2010, voice recording, 3h 41m\\nOn 24 April 2010 at 00:51, Ai Weiwei (@aiww) started a Twitter campaign to commemorate students who perished in the earthquake in Sichuan on 12 May 2008. 3,444 friends from the Internet delivered voice recordings, the names of 5,205 perished were recited 12,140 times. Remembrance is an audio work dedicated to the young people who lost their lives in the Sichuan earthquake. It expresses thoughts for the passing of innocent lives and indignation for the cover-ups on truths about sub-standard architecture, which led to the large number of schools that collapsed during the earthquake.\\n\\n\\n==== San Hua ====\\n2010, video, 1h 8m\\nThe shooting and editing of this video lasted nearly seven months at the Ai Weiwei studio. It began near the end of 2007 in an interception organized by cat-saving volunteers in Tianjin, and the film locations included Tianjin, Shanghai, Rugao of Jiangsu, Chaoshan of Guangzhou, and Hebei Province. The documentary depicts a complete picture of a chain in the cat-trading industry. Since the end of 2009 when the government began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should be eating cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not. There are even people who would go as far as to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is \"imposing the will of the minority on the majority\". Yet the \"majority\" does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats, all the various stages of the trade and how they are distributed across the country, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Rugao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hebei.\\n\\n\\n==== Ordos 100 ====\\n2011, video, 1h 1m\\nThis documentary is about the construction project curated by Herzog & de Meuron and Ai Weiwei. One hundred architects from 27 countries were chosen to participate and design a 1000 square meter villa to be built in a new community in Inner Mongolia. The 100 villas would be designed to fit a master plan designed by Ai Weiwei. On 25 January 2008, the 100 architects gathered in Ordos for a first site visit. The film Ordos 100 documents the total of three site visits to Ordos, during which time the master plan and design of each villa was completed. As of 2016, the Ordos 100 project remains unrealized.\\n\\n\\n==== So Sorry ====\\n2011, video, 54m\\nAs a sequel to Ai Weiwei\\'s film Lao Ma Ti Hua, the film so sorry (named after the artist\\'s 2009 exhibition in Munich, Germany) shows the beginnings of the tension between Ai Weiwei and the Chinese Government. In Lao Ma Ti Hua, Ai Weiwei travels to Chengdu, Sichuan to attend the trial of the civil rights advocate Tan Zuoren, as a witness. So Sorry shows the investigation led by Ai Weiwei studio to identify the students who died during the Sichuan earthquake as a result of corruption and poor building constructions leading to the confrontation between Ai Weiwei and the Chengdu police. After being beaten by the police, Ai Weiwei traveled to Munich, Germany to prepare his exhibition at the museum Haus der Kunst. The result of his beating led to intense headaches caused by a brain hemorrhage and was treated by emergency surgery. These events mark the beginning of Ai Weiwei\\'s struggle and surveillance at the hands of the state police.\\n\\n\\n==== Ping\\'an Yueqing ====\\n2011, video, 2h 22m\\nThis documentary investigates the death of popular Zhaiqiao village leader Qian Yunhui in the fishing village of Yueqing, Zhejiang province. When the local government confiscated marshlands in order to convert them into construction land, the villagers were deprived of the opportunity to cultivate these lands and be fully self-subsistent. Qian Yunhui, unafraid of speaking up for his villagers, travelled to Beijing several times to report this injustice to the central government. In order to silence him, he was detained by local government repeatedly. On 25 December 2010, Qian Yunhui was hit by a truck and died on the scene. News of the incident and photos of the scene quickly spread over the internet. The local government claimed that Qian Yunhui was the victim of an ordinary traffic accident. This film is an investigation conducted by Ai Weiwei studio into the circumstances of the incident and its connection to the land dispute case, mainly based on interviews of family members, villagers and officials. It is an attempt by Ai Weiwei to establish the facts and find out what really happened on 25 December 2010. During shooting and production, Ai Weiwei studio experienced significant obstruction and resistance from local government. The film crew was followed, sometimes physically stopped from shooting certain scenes and there were even attempts to buy off footage. All villagers interviewed for the purposes of this documentary have been interrogated or illegally detained by local government to some extent.\\n\\n\\n==== The Crab House ====\\n2011, video, 1h 1m\\nEarly in 2008, the district government of Jiading, Shanghai invited Ai Weiwei to build a studio in Malu Township, as a part of the local government\\'s efforts in developing its cultural assets. By August 2010, the Ai Weiwei Shanghai Studio completed all of its construction work. In October 2010, the Shanghai government declared the Ai Weiwei Shanghai Studio an illegal construction, and it was subjected to demolition. On 7 November 2010, when Ai Weiwei was placed under house arrest by public security in Beijing, over 1,000 netizens attended the \"River Crab Feast\" at the Shanghai Studio. On 11 January 2011, the Shanghai city government forcibly demolished the Ai Weiwei Studio within a day, without any prior notice.\\n\\n\\n==== Stay Home ====\\n2013, video, 1h 17m\\nThis video tells the story of Liu Ximei, who at her birth in 1985 was given to relatives to be raised because she was born in violation of China\\'s strict one-child policy. When she was ten years old, Liu was severely injured while working in the fields and lost large amounts of blood. While undergoing treatment at a local hospital, she was given a blood transfusion that was later revealed to be contaminated with HIV. Following this exposure to the virus, Liu contracted AIDS. According to official statistics, in 2001 there were 850,000 AIDS sufferers in China, many of whom contracted the illness in the 1980s and 1990s as the result of a widespread plasma market operating in rural, impoverished areas and using unsafe collection methods.\\n\\n\\n==== Ai Weiwei\\'s Appeal ¥15,220,910.50 ====\\n2014, video, 2h 8m\\nAi Weiwei\\'s Appeal ¥15,220,910.50 opens with Ai Weiwei\\'s mother at the Venice Biennial in the summer of 2013 examining Ai\\'s large S.A.C.R.E.D. installation portraying his 81-day imprisonment. The documentary goes onto chronologically reconstruct the events that occurred from the time he was arrested at the Beijing airport in April 2011 to his final court appeal in September 2012. The film portrays the day-to-day activity surrounding Ai Weiwei, his family and his associates ranging from consistent visits by the authorities, interviews with reporters, support and donations from fans, and court dates. The Film premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam on 23 January 2014.\\n\\n\\n==== Fukushima Art Project ====\\n2015, video, 30m\\nThis documentary on the Fukushima Art Project is about artist Ai Weiwei\\'s investigation of the site as well as the project\\'s installation process. In August 2014, Ai Weiwei was invited as one of the participating artists for the Fukushima Nuclear Zone by the Japanese art coalition Chim↑Pom, as part of the project Don\\'t Follow the Wind. Ai accepted the invitation and sent his assistant Ma Yan to the exclusion zone in Japan to investigate the site. The Fukushima Exclusion Zone is thus far located within the 20-kilometer radius of land area of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. 25,000 people have already been evacuated from the Exclusion Zone. Both water and electric circuits were cut off. Entrance restriction is expected to be relieved in the next thirty years, or even longer. The art project will also be open to public at that time. The three spots usable as exhibition spaces by the artists are all former residential houses, among which exhibition sites one and two were used for working and lodging; and exhibition site three was used as a community entertainment facility with an ostrich farm. Ai brought about two projects, A Ray of Hope and Family Album after analyzing materials and information generated from the site.\\nIn A Ray of Hope, a solar photovoltaic system is built on exhibition site one, on the second level of the old warehouse. Integral LED lighting devices are used in the two rooms. The lights would turn on automatically from 7 to 10 pm, and from 6 to 8 am daily. This lighting system is the only light source in the Exclusion Zone after this project was installed. Photos of Ai and his studio staff at Caochangdi that make up project Family Album are displayed on exhibition site two and three, in the seven rooms where locals used to live. The twenty-two selected photos are divided in five categories according to types of events spanning eight years. Among these photos, six of them were taken from the site investigation at the 2008 Sichuan earthquake; two were taken during the time when he was illegally detained after pleading the Tan Zuoren case in Chengdu, China in August 2009; and three others taken during his surgical treatment for his head injury from being attacked in the head by police officers in Chengdu; five taken of him being followed by the police and his Beijing studio Fake Design under surveillance due to the studio tax case from 2011 to 2012; four are photos of Ai Weiwei and his family from year 2011 to year 2013; and the other two were taken earlier of him in his studio in Caochangdi (One taken in 2005 and the other in 2006).\\n\\n\\n==== Human Flow ====\\n\\nA feature documentary directed by Weiwei and co-produced by Andy Cohen about the global refugee crisis.\\n\\n\\n=== Coronation ===\\n\\nA feature-length documentary directed by Weiwei about happenings in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 pandemic. When discussing the film Weiwei claimed \"it\\'s obvious the disease is not from an animal. It\\'s not a natural disease, it\\'s something that\\'s leaked out, after years of research.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Visual arts ===\\n\\nAi\\'s visual art includes sculptural installations, woodworking, video and photography. \"Ai Weiwei: According to What\", adapted and expanded by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden from a 2009 exhibition at Tokyo\\'s Mori Art Museum, was Ai\\'s first North American museum retrospective. It opened at the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C. in 2013, and subsequently traveled to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, and two other venues. His works address his investigation into the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake and responses to the Chinese government\\'s detention and surveillance of him. His recent public pieces have called attention to the Syrian refugee crisis.\\n\\n\\n==== Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn ====\\n\\n(1995) Performance in which Ai lets an ancient ceramic urn fall from his hands and smash to pieces on the ground. The performance was memorialized in a series of three photographic still frames.\\n\\n\\n==== Map of China ====\\n(2008) Sculpture resembling a park bench or tree trunk, but its cross-section is a map of China. It is four metres long and weighs 635 kilograms. It is made from wood salvaged from Qing dynasty temples.\\n\\n\\n==== Table with two legs on the wall ====\\n(2008) Ming dynasty table cut in half and rejoined at a right angle to rest two feet on the wall and two on the floor. The reconstruction was completed using Chinese period specific joinery techniques.\\n\\n\\n==== Straight ====\\n(2008–2012) 150 tons of twisted steel reinforcements recovered from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake building collapse sites were straightened out and displayed as an installation.\\n\\n\\n==== Sunflower Seeds ====\\n\\n(2010) In October 2010, at the Tate Modern in London, Ai displayed 100 million handmade and painted porcelain sunflower seeds. The work as installed was called 1-125,000,000 and subsequent installations have been titled Sunflower Seeds. The initial installation had the seeds spread across the floor of the Turbine Hall in a thin 10 cm layer. The seeds weigh about 10 metric tonnes and were made by artisans over two and a half years by 1,600 Jingdezhen artisans in a city where porcelain had been made for over a thousand years. The sculpture refers to chairman Mao\\'s rule and the Chinese Communist Party. The mass of tiny seeds represents that, together, the people of China can stand up and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. The seeds also refer to China\\'s current mass automated production, based on Western consumerist culture. The sculpture challenges the \"Made in China\" mantra, memorialising labour-intensive traditional methods of crafting objects.\\n\\n\\n==== Surveillance Camera ====\\n(2010) Ai WeiWei\\'s marble sculpture resembles a Surveillance Camera to express the alarming rate of how technological advancements are being used in the modern world. WeiWei created this sculpture in response to the Chinese Government surveilling and incorporating listening devices in and around his studio, located in Beijing. The Chinese government did this as punishment for WeiWei\\'s outspoken criticism of the Chinese Government.\\n\\n\\n==== He Xie/Crab ====\\n(2010) Sculptures of a large amount of crabs.\\n\\n\\n==== Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads ====\\n(2011) Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads are sculptures of zodiac animals inspired by the water clock-fountain at the Old Summer Palace.\\nBelongings of Ye Haiyan\\n(2013) Ye Haiyan\\'s (叶海燕) Belongings is a collaborative piece between Ai Weiwei and Ye Haiyan. Ye, also referred to as \"Hooligan Sparrow\", is an activist for women\\'s rights and sex worker\\'s rights. After consistent surveillance and harassment for her outspoken activism as chronicled in Nanfu Wang\\'s documentary Hooligan Sparrow, Haiyan and her daughter were met with multiple evictions in various cities and ultimately ended up on the side of the road with all of their belongings and no place to go. Ai Weiwei was able to help them financially and included this piece in his exhibition \"According to What?\". The display consists of four walls which display pictures of Haiyan, her daughter, and their life\\'s belongings that they packed quickly prior to their first eviction. In the center, Ai recreated their belongings before they were confiscated.\\n\\n\\n==== Coca-Cola Vases ====\\n(1994) Han dynasty vases with the Coca-Cola logo brushed onto them is one of the artists\\' longest running series, begun in 1994 and continuing to the present day.\\n\\n\\n==== Grapes ====\\n(2014) 32 Qing dynasty stools joined in a cluster with legs pointing out.\\n\\n\\n==== Free-speech Puzzle ====\\n(2014) Individual porcelain ornaments, each painted with characters for \"free speech\", which when set together form a map of China.\\n\\n\\n==== Trace ====\\n(2014) Consisting of 176 2D-portraits in Lego which are set onto a large floor space, Trace was commissioned by the FOR-SITE Foundation, the United States National Park Service and the Golden Gate Park Conservancy. The original installation was at Alcatraz Prison in San Francisco Bay; the 176 portraits being of various political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. After seeing one million visitors during its one-year display at Alcatraz, the installation was moved and put on display at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. (in a modified form; the pieces had to be arranged to fit the circular floor space). The display at the Hirshhorn ran from 28 June 2017 – 1 January 2018. The display also included two versions of his wallpaper work The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca and a video running on a loop.\\nThe 2019 documentary film Yours Truly covered the creation of Trace and an associated exhibit, Yours Truly, also at Alcatraz, where visitors could write postcards to be sent to selected political prisoners.\\n\\n\\n==== Law of the Journey ====\\n(2017) As the culmination of Ai\\'s experiences visiting 40 refugee camps in 2016, Law of the Journey featured an all-black, 230-foot-long (70 m) inflatable boat carrying 258 faceless refugee figures. The art piece is currently on display at the National Gallery in Prague until 7 January 2018.\\n\\n\\n==== Two Iron Trees at The Shrine of Book ====\\n(2017) Permanent exhibit, unique setting of two Iron Trees from now on frame the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem, Israel where Dead Sea Scrolls are preserved.\\n\\n\\n==== Journey of Laziz ====\\n(2017) The exhibition was on the view in the Israel Museum until the end of October 2017. Journey of Laziz is a video installation, showing the mental breakdown and overall suffering of a tiger living in the \"world\\'s worst zoo\" in Gaza.\\n\\n\\n==== Hansel and Gretel ====\\n(2017) The exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory from 7 June- 6 August 2017, Hansel and Gretel was an installation exploring the theme of surveillance. The project, a collaboration of Ai Weiwei and architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, features surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition software, near-infrared floor projections, tethered, autonomous drones and sonar beacons. A companion website includes a curatorial statement, artist biographies, a livestream of the installation and a timeline of surveillance technology from ancient to modern times.\\n\\n\\n==== The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca ====\\n(2017) The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca, and its companion piece The Plain Version of The Animal That Looks Like a Llama but Is Really an Alpaca, is a wallpaper work consisting of intricate tiled patterns showing various pieces of surveillance equipment in whimsical arrangements. The two pieces were installed at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., as part of a full-floor exhibition of his work that also included a video and the 2014 installation Trace.\\n\\n\\n==== man in a cube ====\\n(2017) Ai Weiwei created the sculpture man in a cube for the exhibition Luther and the Avantgarde in Wittenberg to mark the 2017 quincentenary of the Reformation. In it, the artist worked through his experiences of anxiety and isolation following his arrest by Chinese authorities: \"My work is physically a concrete block, which contains within it a single figure in solitude. That figure is the likeness of myself during my eighty-one days under secret detention in 2011.\" Concentrating on ideas and language helped Ai Weiwei endure his imprisonment. He was also intrigued by the connectedness of freedom, language and ideas in Martin Luther, to whom he explicitly paid tribute with man in a cube.\\nOnce the exhibition in Wittenberg closed, the Stiftung Lutherhaus Eisenach endeavored to make this exceptional manifestation of contemporary Reformation commemoration, man in a cube, permanently accessible to a wide audience. Thanks to the generous support of numerous backers, the museum managed to acquire the sculpture in 2019. It was erected in the courtyard of the Lutherhaus and presented to the public in a ceremony the following year, the five hundredth anniversary of the publication of Martin Luther\\'s treatise On the Freedom of a Christian.\\n\\n\\n==== Good Fences Make Good Neighbors ====\\nAi Weiwei\\'s 2017–18 New York City-wide public art exhibition.\\n\\n\\n==== Forever Bicycles ====\\nForever Bicycles is a 32-foot (9.8 m) sculpture made of many interconnected bicycles. The sculpture was installed as 1,300 bicycles in Austin, Texas, in 2017. The sculpture was moved to The Forks in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and reassembled as 1,254 bicycles in 2019.\\nThe 30-foot (9.1 m) sculpture\\'s bicycles are made to resemble the Shanghai Forever Co. bicycles that were financially out of reach for the artist\\'s family during his youth.\\n\\n\\n==== Forever ====\\nA sculpture of many bicycles is displayed as public art in the gardens of the Artz Pedregal shopping mall in Mexico City since its opening in March 2018, and it is part of Fundación Arte Abierto\\'s collection.\\n\\n\\n==== Priceless ====\\nA collaboration with conceptual artist Kevin Abosch primarily made up of two standard ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, called PRICELESS (PRCLS is its symbol). One of these tokens is forever unavailable to anyone, but the other is meant for distribution and is divisible up to 18 decimal places, meaning it can be given away one quintillionth at a time. A nominal amount of the distributable token was \"burned\" (put into digital wallets with the keys thrown away), and these wallet addresses were printed on paper and sold to art buyers in a series of 12 physical works. Each wallet address alphanumeric is a proxy for a shared moment between Abosch and Ai.\\nEr Xi\\nA monstrous sculptures at Le Bon Marché in Paris to \"speak to our inner child\". Artist Ai Weiwei has used traditional Chinese kite-making techniques to create mythological characters and creatures for windows, atriums and the gallery at Paris department store Le Bon Marché (+ slideshow). Er Xi opened on 16 January 2016 until 20 February 2016 at Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche, located on Rue de Sèvres in Paris\\' 7th arrondissement.\\nMiddle Finger in Pink\\nIn June 2023, his artwork \"Middle Finger in Pink\" was used as the cover artwork for the Peter Gabriel song \"Road to Joy\", from his forthcoming album i/o.

According to The New York Times, the Tsai Residence is divided into four modules and the details are \"extraordinarily refined\". In 2010, Wallpaper* magazine nominated the residence for its Wallpaper Design Awards category: Best New Private House. A detached guesthouse, also designed by Ai and HHF Architects, was completed after the main house and, according to New York Magazine, looks like a \"floating boomerang of rusty Cor-Ten steel\".\\n\\n\\n==== Ordos 100 ====\\nIn 2008, Ai curated the architecture project Ordos 100 in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia. He invited 100 architects from 29 countries to participate in this project.\\n\\n\\n==== Beijing National Stadium ====\\n\\nAi was commissioned as the artistic consultant for design, collaborating with the Swiss firm Herzog & de Meuron, for the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics, also known as the \"Bird\\'s Nest\". Although ignored by the Chinese media, he had voiced his anti-Olympics views. He later distanced himself from the project, saying, \"I\\'ve already forgotten about it. I turn down all the demands to have photographs with it,\" saying it is part of a \"pretend smile\" of bad taste. In August 2007, he also accused those choreographing the Olympic opening ceremony, including Steven Spielberg and Zhang Yimou, of failing to live up to their responsibility as artists. Ai said \"It\\'s disgusting. I don\\'t like anyone who shamelessly abuses their profession, who makes no moral judgment.\" In February 2008, Spielberg withdrew from his role as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics. When asked why he participated in the designing of the Bird\\'s Nest in the first place, Ai replied \"I did it because I love design.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Serpentine Pavilion ====\\nIn summer 2012, Ai teamed again with Herzog & de Meuron on a \"would-be archaeological site [as] a game of make-believe and fleeting memory\" as the year\\'s temporary Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London\\'s Kensington Gardens.\\n\\n\\n=== Books ===\\n\\n\\n==== Venice Elegy ====\\nThis edition of Yang Lian\\'s poems and Ai Weiwei\\'s visual images was realized by the publishing house Damocle Edizioni – Venice in 200 numbered copies on Fabriano Paper.

The video was an attempt to criticize the Chinese government\\'s attempt to silence his activism and was quickly blocked by national authorities.\\nOn 22 May 2013, Ai debuted his first single Dumbass over the internet, with a music video shot by cinematographer Christopher Doyle. The video was a reconstruction of Ai\\'s experience in prison, during his 81-day detention, and dives in and out of the prison\\'s reality and the guarding soldiers\\' fantasies. He later released a second single, Laoma Tihua, on 20 June 2013 along with a video on his experience of state surveillance, with footage compiled from his studio\\'s documentaries. On 22 June 2013, the two-year anniversary of Ai\\'s release, he released his first music album The Divine Comedy.

The winning design, combining the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative\\'s goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement.[98] In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said \"Even though we know governments do all kinds of things I was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it\\'s abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals\\' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights.\"[99]\\nIn 2012, Ai interviewed a member of the 50 Cent Party, a group of \"online commentators\" (otherwise known as sockpuppets) covertly hired by the Chinese government to post \"comments favourable towards party policies and [intending] to shape public opinion on internet message boards and forums\". Keeping Ai\\'s source anonymous, the transcript was published by the British magazine New Statesman on 17 October 2012, offering insights on the education, life, methods and tactics used by professional trolls serving pro-government interests.\\nAi designed the cover for 17 June 2013 issue of Time magazine. The cover story, by Hannah Beech, is \"How China Sees the World\". Time magazine called it \"the most beautiful cover we\\'ve ever done in our history.\"\\nIn 2011, Ai served as co-director and curator of the 2011 Gwangju Design Biennale, and co-curator of the exhibition Shanshui at The Museum of Art Lucerne.

              "  'Catherine Sue Opie (born 1961) is an American fine art photographer and educator. She lives and works in Los Angeles, as a professor of photography at the University of California, Los Angeles.\\nOpie studies the connections between mainstream and infrequent society. By specializing in portraiture, studio, and landscape photography, she is able to create pieces relating to sexual identity. Through photography, Opie documents the relationship between the individual and the space inhabited, offering an exploration of the American identity, particularly probing the tensions between the constructed American dream and the diverse realities of its citizens. Merging conceptual and documentary styles, Opie\\'s oeuvre gravitates towards portraiture and landscapes, utilizing serial images and unexpected compositions to both spotlight and blur the lines of gender, community, and place while invoking the formal gravitas reminiscent of Renaissance portraiture and hinting at her deep engagement with the history of art and painting. \\nShe is known for her portraits exploring the Los Angeles leather-dyke community. Her work is held in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and she has won awards including the United States Artists Fellowship (2006) and the President’s Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Women’s Caucus for Art (2009).\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nOpie was born in Sandusky, Ohio. She spent her early childhood in Ohio and was influenced heavily by photographer Lewis Hine. At the age of nine, she received a Kodak Instamatic camera and immediately began taking photographs of her family and community. She evolved as an artist at age 14 when she created her own darkroom. Her family moved from Ohio to California in 1975. She earned a Bachelor of Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1985.\\nShe later received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 1988. Before arriving at CalArts, she was a strictly black-and-white photographer. Opie\\'s thesis project entitled Master Plan (1988) examined a wide variety of topics. The project looked deeper into construction sites, advertisement schemes, homeowner regulations, and the interior layout of their homes within the community of Valencia, California.\\nIn 1988, Opie moved to Los Angeles, California, and began working as an artist. She supported herself by accepting a job as a lab technician at the University of California, Irvine. Opie and her former partner, painter Julie Burleigh, constructed working studios in the backyard of their home in South Central Los Angeles.\\nIn 2001, Opie gave birth to a boy named Oliver through intrauterine insemination.\\nAt the Hammer Museum, Opie was on the first Artist Council (a series of sessions with curators and museum administrators) and served on the board of overseers. Along with fellow artists John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, and Ed Ruscha, Opie served as a member of the board for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. In 2012, she and the others resigned; however, they joined the museum\\'s 14-member search committee for a new director after Jeffrey Deitch\\'s resignation in 2013. Opie returned in support of the museum\\'s new director, Philippe Vergne, in 2014. She was also on the board of the Andy Warhol Foundation.\\nAlong with Richard Hawkins, Opie curated a selection of work by the late artist Tony Greene at the 2014 Whitney Biennial, in New York. As of 2017, Opie has her studio at The Brewery Art Colony. \\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Art ===\\n\\nOpie\\'s work is characterized by a combination of formal concerns, a variety of printing technologies, references to art history, and social/political commentary. It demonstrates a mix between traditional photography and unconventional subjects. For example, she explores abstraction in the landscape vis-a-vis the placement of the horizon line in the Icehouses (2001) and Surfers (2003) series. She has printed photographs using Chronochrome, Iris prints, Polaroids, and silver photogravure. Examples of art history references include the use of bright color backgrounds in portraits that reference the work of Hans Holbein and the full-body frontal portraits that reference August Sander. Opie also depicts herself with her son in the traditional pose of Madonna and Child in Self Portrait/Nursing (2004).\\nOpie first came to be known with Being and Having (1991) and Portraits (1993–1997), which portray queer communities in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Being and Having looks at the outward portrayal of masculinity and is a reference to 17th-century Old Master portraiture. It conveyed strong ideals and perceptions among persons of the LGBT community, referencing gender, age, race, and identity; all constructed surrounding identity. This body of work similarly plays with performative aspects and play. These works read as iconography themselves.\\nThe use of certain symbols in her works has allowed these portraits to sit separately from any of her previous works. For instance, the portrait Self Portrait/Pervert (1994) uses blood. The symbolism used in this work is recognized as a recurring statement for Opie, personally and allegorically. These images convey symbolic references to the celebration, embracing, and remembrance of the shift and personal relationship with one\\'s body. Opie\\'s use of blood is also seen in another work entitled Self-portrait/Cutting (1993).\\nOpie\\'s earlier work relies more heavily on documentary photography as opposed to allegorical, yet still provides a stark relationship to her investigation and use of powerful iconography throughout the years.\\nA common social/political theme in her work is the concept of community. Opie has investigated aspects of community, making portraits of many groups including the LGBT community, surfers, and most recently, high school football players. Opie is interested in how identities are shaped by our surrounding architecture. Her work is informed by her identity as an out lesbian. Her works balance personal and political. Her assertive portraits bring queers to a forefront that is normally silenced by societal norms. Her work also explores how the idea of family varies between straight and LGBTQ communities. Opie highlights that LGBTQ households often base their families on close friendships and community, while straight families focus on their individual families.\\nOpie has referenced problems of visibility, where the reference to Renaissance paintings in her images declares the individuals as saints or characters. Opie\\'s portraits document, celebrate, and protect the community and individuals in which she photographs. In Portraits (1993–1997), she presents a variety of identities among the queer community, such as drag kings, cross-dressers, and F-to-M transexuals.\\nThis Los Angeles-focused series sparked her ongoing project American Cities (1997–present), which is a collection of panoramic black-and-white photographs of quintessential American cities. This series is similar to an earlier work of hers, Domestic (1995–1998), which documented her 2-month RV road trip, portraying lesbian families engaging in everyday household activities across the country.\\nDrawing inspiration from the transgressive photography of Robert Mapplethorpe, Nan Goldin, and sex radicals, who provided a space for liberals and feminists, Opie has also explored controversial topics and imagery in her work. In her O folio—6 photogravures from 1999—Opie photographed S-M porn images she took earlier for On Our Backs, but as extreme close-ups.\\nIn 2011, Opie photographed the home of the actress Elizabeth Taylor in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Taylor died during the project and never met Opie. Opie took 3,000 images for the project; 129 comprised the completed study. The resultant images were published as 700 Nimes Road. Collector Daily noted the \"relentless femininity of Taylor\\'s taste\" in the images contrasted with Opie\\'s self-declared \"identity as a butch woman\" in Opie\\'s forward to 700 Nimes Road and Opie\\'s \"status as an ordinary mortal\" in comparison to Taylor\\'s stardom.\\nOpie\\'s first film, The Modernist (2017), is a tribute to French filmmaker Chris Marker\\'s 1962 classic La Jetée. Composed of 800 still images, the film features Pig Pen (aka Stosh Fila)—a genderqueer performance artist—as the protagonist. The Modernist has been described as an ode to the city in which it takes place, Los Angeles, but it is also seen as questioning the legacy of modernism in America. In summary, the twenty-two-minute film is about an aggravated artist who just wants his own home as he has fallen in love with the architecture of Los Angeles. Being unable to purchase a place to live, the performance artist goes around burning down lovely architecture of LA.\\n\\n\\n=== Teaching ===\\nOpie\\'s teaching career began in 2001 at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). In 2019, UCLA announced Opie as the university’s inaugural endowed chair in the art department, a position underwritten by a $2-million gift from philanthropists Lynda and Stewart Resnick.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\nFreeways.

              "  \"Keith Sonnier (July 31, 1941 – July 18, 2020) was a postminimalist sculptor, performance artist, video and light artist. Sonnier was one of the first artists to use light in sculpture in the 1960s. With his use of neon in combination with ephemeral materials he achieved international recognition. Sonnier was part of the Process Art movement.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\nJames Keith Sonnier was born July 31, 1941, in Mamou, Louisiana. His family was Cajun and Roman Catholic. His father was a hardware store owner, Joseph Sonnier, and his mother was a florist and singer, Mae Ledoux.\\nHe graduated in 1963 from Southwestern Louisiana Institute (now known as the University of Louisiana at Lafayette). In 1966, he graduated with his MFA degree from Rutgers University, where he studied under Allan Kaprow, Robert Watts, and Robert Morris. After graduation from Rutgers, he moved to New York City with Jackie Winsor and some of his former classmates.\\nAt the time of his death he lived in Bridgehampton, New York. Sonnier died in Southampton, NY on July 18, 2020, of MDS (Myelodysplastic syndrome) and complications from it at the age of 78.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\nSonnier began experimenting with neon in 1968. Neon lights became a signature material used in his sculptural works. The common materials Sonnier employed included neon and fluorescent lights; reflective materials; aluminum and copper; and glass and wires.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life ==\\nIn 1966 he married the sculptor Jackie Winsor, who at the time was a fellow art student from Rutgers University. His marriage to Winsor ended in divorce in 1980.\\nHis second marriage was in 1987 to Nessia Leonzini Pope, ending in divorce by 1998.

              "  'Kiki Smith (born January 18, 1954) is a German-born American artist whose work has addressed the themes of sex, birth and regeneration. Her figurative work of the late 1980s and early 1990s confronted subjects such as AIDS, feminism, and gender, while recent works have depicted the human condition in relationship to nature. Smith lives and works in the Lower East Side, New York City, and the Hudson Valley, New York State.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nSmith\\'s father was artist Tony Smith and her mother was actress and opera singer Jane Lawrence. Although her work takes a very different form than that of her parents, early exposure to her father\\'s process of making geometric sculptures allowed her to experience Modernism\\'s formal craftsmanship firsthand. Her childhood experience in the Catholic Church, combined with a fascination for the human body, shaped her artwork conceptually.\\nSmith moved from Germany to South Orange, New Jersey, as an infant in 1955. That same year, her sisters, Seton Smith and Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, were born in Newark, New Jersey. Smith subsequently attended Columbia High School, but left to attend Changes, Inc. Later, she was enrolled at Hartford Art School in Connecticut for eighteen months from 1974 to 1975. She then moved to New York City in 1976 and joined Collaborative Projects (Colab), an artist collective. The influence of this radical group\\'s use of unconventional materials can be seen in her work. For a short time in 1984, she studied to be an emergency medical technician and sculpted body parts. By 1990, she began to craft human figures.\\n\\n\\n== Work ==\\n\\n\\n=== Themes ===\\nPrompted by her father\\'s death in 1980 and by the AIDS death of her sister, the underground actress Beatrice \"Bebe\" Smith, in 1988, Smith began an ambitious investigation of mortality and the physicality of the human body. She has gone on to create works that explore a wide range of human organs; including sculptures of hearts, lungs, stomach, liver and spleen. Related to this was her work exploring bodily fluids, which also had social significance as responses to the AIDS crisis (blood) and women\\'s rights (urine, menstrual blood, feces).\\n\\n\\n=== Film ===\\nIn 1984 Smith finished a definitively unfinished feminist no wave super8 film, begun in 1981, entitled Cave Girls. It was co-directed by Ellen Cooper.\\n\\n\\n=== Printmaking ===\\nSmith has experimented with a wide range of printmaking processes. Some of her earliest print works were screen-printed dresses, scarves and shirts, often with images of body parts. In association with Colab, Smith printed an array of posters in the early 1980s containing political statements or announcing Colab events, such as her The Island of Negative Utopia poster done for ABC No Rio in 1983. In 1988 she created All Souls, a fifteen-foot screen-print work featuring repetitive images of a fetus, an image Smith found in a Japanese anatomy book. Smith printed the image in black ink on 36 attached sheets of handmade Thai paper.\\nMoMA and the Whitney Museum both have extensive collections of Smith\\'s prints. In the Blue Prints series, 1999, Kiki Smith experimented with the aquatint process. The Virgin with Dove was achieved with an airbrushed aquatint, an acid resist that protects the copper plate. When printed, this technique results in a halo around the Virgin Mary and Holy Spirit.\\n\\n\\n=== Sculpture ===\\nMary Magdelene (1994), a sculpture made of silicon bronze and forged steel, is an example of Smith\\'s non-traditional use of the female nude. The figure is without skin everywhere but her face, breasts and the area surrounding her navel. She wears a chain around her ankle; her face is relatively undetailed and is turned upwards. Smith has said that when making Mary Magdalene she was inspired by depictions of Mary Magdalene in Southern German sculpture, where she was depicted as a \"wild woman\". Smith\\'s sculpture \"Standing\" (1998), featuring a female figure standing atop the trunk of a Eucalyptus tree, is a part of the Stuart Collection of public art on the campus of the University of California, San Diego. Another sculpture, Lilith, a bronze with glass eyes is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Lilith is an arresting figure, hanging upside down on a wall of the gallery.\\nIn 2005, Smith\\'s installation, Homespun Tales won acclaim at the 51st Venice Biennale. Lodestar, Smith\\'s 2010 installation at the Pace Gallery, was an exhibition of free-standing stained glass works painted with life-size figures.\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nAfter five years of development, Smith\\'s first permanent outdoor sculpture was installed in 1998 on the campus of the University of California, San Diego.\\nIn 2010, the Museum at Eldridge Street commissioned Smith and architect Deborah Gans to create a new monumental east window for the 1887 Eldridge Street Synagogue, a National Historic Landmark located on New York\\'s Lower East Side. This permanent commission marked the final significant component of the museum\\'s 20-year restoration and was topped off with an exhibition of site-specific sculptures by Smith in a 2018 show entitled Below the Horizon: Kiki Smith at Eldridge.\\nFor the Claire Tow Theater above the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Smith conceived Overture (2012), a little mobile made of cross-hatched planks and cast-bronze birds.\\nIn 2019, Smith conceived Memory, a site specific installation for the DESTE Foundation for Contemporary Art on the Greek island of Hydra.\\n\\n\\n=== Artist books ===\\nShe has created unique books, including:\\nFountainhead (1991); The Vitreous Body (2001); and Untitled (Book of Hours) (1986).\\n\\n\\n=== Tapestries ===\\nSince the early 2010s Smith has created twelve 9 x 6 ft. Jacquard tapestries, published by Magnolia Editions.  In 2012, Smith showed a series of three of these woven editions at the Neuberger Museum of Art. In early 2019, all twelve were exhibited together as part of \"What I saw on the road\" at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, Italy. Smith notes that the tapestries provide an opportunity to work at a larger scale (\"I never thought I could make a picture so big\") and to work with color, which she does not frequently do otherwise.\\n\\n\\n=== Mosaics ===\\nIn 2022, Smith to created a series of five giant mosaics for Manhattan train station at Grand Central Madison station, located beneath the Grand Central Terminal. The mosaics are titled River Light, The Water\\'s Way, The Presence, The Spring, and The Sound (all 2022).\\n\\n\\n== Collaborations ==\\nSmith was an active member of Collaborative Projects and ABC No Rio; participating in many Potato Wolf broadcasts and the Cardboard Air Band. Smith collaborated with David Wojnarowicz on her first solo exhibition, Life Wants to Live, at The Kitchen. During this period (the early 1980s), Smith collaborated and co-directed with Ellen Cooper on a group collaboration with many young women associated with the Bush Tetras and Colab for her 1984 No Wave underground film Cave Girls. Later she collaborated with poet Mei-mei Berssenbrugge to produce Endocrinology (1997), and Concordance (2006), and with author Lynne Tillman to create Madame Realism (1984). She has worked with poet Anne Waldman on If I Could Say This With My Body, Would I. I Would. Smith also collaborated on a performance featuring choreographer Douglas Dunn and Dancers, musicians Ha-Yang Kim, Daniel Carter, Ambrose Bye, and Devin Brahja Waldman, performed by and set to Anne Waldman\\'s poem Jaguar Harmonics.\\n\\n\\n== Exhibitions ==\\nIn 1980, Smith participated in the Colab organized exhibition The Times Square Show. In 1982, Smith received her first solo exhibition, Life Wants to Live, at The Kitchen. Since then, her work has been exhibited in nearly 150 solo exhibitions at museums and galleries worldwide and has been featured in hundreds of significant group exhibitions, including the Whitney Biennial, New York (1991, 1993, 2002); La Biennale di Firenze, Florence, Italy (1996-1997; 1998); and the Venice Biennale (1993, 1999, 2005, 2009).\\nPast solo exhibitions have been held at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and the Modern Art Museum, Fort Worth (1996–97); Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1996–97); Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (1997–98); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC (1998); Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (1998); Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson (1999); St. Louis Art Museum (1999-2000); and the International Center for Photography (2001).\\nIn 1996, Smith exhibited in a group show at SITE Santa Fe, along with Kara Walker.\\nIn 2005, \"the artist\\'s first full-scale American museum survey\" titled Kiki Smith: A Gathering, 1980-2005 debuted at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Then an expansion came to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis where the show originated. At the Walker, Smith coauthored the catalogue raisonné with curator Siri Engberg.\\nThe exhibition traveled to the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and finally to La Coleccion Jumex in Ecatepec de Morelos outside Mexico City. In 2008, Smith gave Selections from Animal Skulls (1995) to the Walker in honor of Engberg.\\nIn 2016, the Walsh Gallery at Seton Hall University, in collaboration with the Lennie Pierro Memorial Arts Foundation, hosted Kiki and Seton Smith: A Sense of Place.\\nSmith participated in the 2017 Venice Biennale, Viva Arte Viva, from May 13 – November 16, 2017.\\nIn 2018, Smith took part in Frieze Sculpture (part of Frieze Art Fair, where her work Seer (Alice I), Timothy Taylor (gallery), was presented in Regent\\'s Park, London, England, from July 4 – October 7, 2018.\\nAlso in London in 2018, an exhibition of Smith\\'s tapestries, sculpture and works on paper was presented at the Timothy Taylor (gallery) from September 13 – October 27. Woodland was produced in collaboration with Magnolia Editions.\\nIn 2019, the Deste Foundation\\'s Project Space at the Slaughterhouse on Hydra island featured Memory, a site specific exhibition.\\nIn 2019 The 11 Conti – Monnaie de Paris presented the first solo show of Smith by a French public institution.\\nIn 2019 the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere in Vienna, Austria, presented a solo show of Smith entitled \"Processions\", presenting about sixty works from the last three decades.\\n\\n\\n== Other activities ==\\nIn 2023, Smith served on the jury that chose Sarah Lucas as first winner of the New Museum\\'s $400,000 Hostetler/Wrigley Sculpture Award.\\n\\n\\n== Recognition ==\\nSmith\\'s many accolades also include the Nelson A. Rockefeller Award from Purchase College School of the Arts (2010), Women in the Arts Award from the Brooklyn Museum (2009), the 50th Edward MacDowell Medal (2009), the Medal Award from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (2006), the Athena Award for Excellence in Printmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design (2006), the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture from the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Maine (2000), and Time Magazine\\'s \"Time 100: The People Who Shape Our World\" (2006).

              "  'Hans Haacke (born August 12, 1936) is a German-born artist who lives and works in New York City. Haacke is considered a \"leading exponent\" of Institutional Critique.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nHaacke was born in Cologne, Germany. He studied at the Staatliche Werkakademie in Kassel, Germany, from 1956 to 1960. In 1959, Haacke was hired to assist with the second documenta, working as a guard and tour guide. He was a student of Stanley William Hayter, a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962, he studied on a Fulbright grant at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. From 1967 to 2002, Haacke was a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City.\\n\\nDuring his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957–1966). This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art\\'s metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.\\nAlthough their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke\\'s early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.\\nThese early installations focused on systems and processes.  Condensation Cube (1963–65) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s, his art had found a more specific focus.\\n\\n\\n== Systems work (1970–present) ==\\nHaacke\\'s interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems. In most of his work after the late 1960s, Haacke focused on the art world and the system of exchange between museums and corporations and corporate leaders; he often underlines its effects in site-specific ways.\\nHaacke has been outspoken throughout his career about demystifying the relationship between museums and businesses and their individual practices. He writes, \"what we have here is a real exchange of capital: financial capital on the part of the sponsors and symbolic capital on the part of the sponsored\". Using this concept from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, Haacke has underlined the idea that corporate sponsorship of art enhances the sponsoring corporations\\' public reputation, which is of material use to them.  Haacke believes, moreover, that both parties are aware of this exchange, and as an artist, Haacke is intent on making this relationship clear to viewers.\\nIn 1970, Hans Haacke proposed a work for the exhibition entitled Information to be held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (an exhibition meant to be an overview of current younger artists), according to which the visitors would be asked to vote on a current socio-political issue. The proposal was accepted, and Haacke prepared his installation, entitled MoMA Poll, but did not hand in the specific question until right before the opening of the show. His query asked, \"Would the fact that Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon\\'s Indochina Policy be a reason for your not voting for him in November?\" Visitors were asked to deposit their answers in the appropriate one of two transparent Plexiglas ballot boxes. At the end of the exhibition, there were approximately twice as many Yes ballots as No ballots. Haacke\\'s question commented directly on the involvements of a major donor and board member at MOMA, Nelson Rockefeller. This installation is an early example of what in the art world came to be known as institutional critique. MoMA Poll was cited in 2019 by The New York Times as one of the works of art that defined the contemporary age.\\nIn one of his best-known works, which quickly became an art historical landmark, Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, A Real Time Social System, as of May 1, 1971, Haacke took on the real-estate holdings of one of New York City\\'s biggest slum landlords. The work exposed, through meticulous documentation and photographs, the questionable transactions of Harry Shapolsky\\'s real-estate business between 1951 and 1971. Haacke\\'s solo show at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, which was to include this work and which made an issue of the business and personal connections of the museum\\'s trustees, was cancelled on the grounds of artistic impropriety by the museum\\'s director six weeks before the opening. (Shapolsky was not such a trustee, although some have misunderstood the affair by assuming that he was.) Curator Edward Fry was consequently fired for his support of the work.\\nFollowing the abrupt cancellation of his exhibition and the trouble it had caused with the museum, Haacke turned to other galleries, to Europe and his native country, where his work was more often accepted. Ten years later he included the Shapolsky work—by then widely known—at his solo exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, entitled  \"Hans Haacke: Unfinished Business\".\\nAt the John Weber gallery in New York, in 1972, on two separate occasions, Haacke created a sociological study, collecting data from gallery visitors. He requested the visitors fill out a questionnaire with 20 questions ranging from their personal demographic background information to opinions on social and political issues. The results of the questionnaires were translated into pie charts and bar graphs that were presented in the gallery at a later date. They revealed, among other things, that most visitors were related in some way to the professions of art, art teaching, and museology, and most were politically liberal.\\nIn 1974, Haacke submitted another proposal that was subsequently rejected for an exhibition at the Wallraf–Richartz Museum in Cologne. The work described a well-documented history of the ownership (with individual biographies of each of the owners) of Manet\\'s painting Bunch of Asparagus in the museum\\'s collection, narrating how it came into the collection, and in which the Third Reich activities of its donor were revealed. Instead, the work was exhibited in the Paul Menz Gallery in Cologne with a color reproduction in place of the original.\\nIn 1975, Haacke created a similar piece to the Manet project at the John Weber gallery in New York, exposing the history of ownership of Seurat\\'s Models (Les Poseuses) (small version).  In the same manner as the previous installation, this work showed the increase of the value of the work as it passed from one patron to another.\\nAlso In 1975, he created one of his most memorable installations, entitled On Social Grease. The work, which takes its title from a speech by a corporate head of one of the world\\'s major oil companies, is made up of carefully fractured plaques exhibiting quotes from business executives and important art world figures. These plaques display their opinions on the system of exchange between museums and businesses, speaking directly to the importance of the arts in business practices.\\nIn 1978, Haacke had a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England, that included the new work A Breed Apart, which made explicit criticism of the state-owned British Leyland for exporting vehicles for police and military use to apartheid South Africa.\\nHis 1979 solo exhibition at Chicago\\'s Renaissance Society featured paintings that reproduced and altered print ads for Mobil, Allied Chemical, and Tiffany & Co.\\n\\n\\n=== 1980s ===\\nWith extensive research Haacke continued throughout the 1980s to target corporations and museums in his work through larger scale installations and paintings. In 1982, at the documenta 7 exhibition, Haacke exhibited a very large work that included oil portraits of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in 19th-century style, facing on the opposite wall a gigantic photograph of the demonstration against nuclear arms held earlier that year—the largest demonstration in Germany since the end of the Second World War.  The clear implication, supported by Haacke\\'s remarks, was that these two figures were attempting to roll back their respective nations to the socially and politically regressive, laissez-faire, and imperialist policies of the 19th century. In 1988 he was given an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London at which he exhibited the portrait of Margaret Thatcher, full of iconographic references featuring cameos of Maurice and Charles Saatchi. The Saatchis were well known not only as art collectors on an aggressive scale, widely affecting the course of the art world by their choices, but also as the managers of Thatcher\\'s successful, fear-based political campaigns as well as that of the South African premier, P. W. Botha.\\n\\n\\n=== 1990s ===\\nHaacke\\'s controversial 1990 painting Cowboy with Cigarette turned Picasso\\'s Man with a Hat (1912–13) into a cigarette advertisement. The work was a reaction to the Phillip Morris company\\'s sponsorship of a 1989–90 exhibition about Cubism at the Museum of Modern Art.\\nHaacke has had solo exhibitions since, at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.\\nIn 1993, Haacke shared, with Nam June Paik, the Golden Lion for the German Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Haacke\\'s installation Germania made explicit reference to the pavilion\\'s roots in the politics of Nazi Germany.  Haacke tore up the floor of the German pavilion as Hitler once had done. In 1993, looking through the doors of the pavilion, past the broken floor, the viewer witnesses the word on the wall: \"Germania\", Hitler\\'s name for Nazi Berlin.\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nAt the 2000, Whitney Biennial, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Haacke presented a piece that is a direct reaction to art censorship. The piece called Sanitation featured six anti-art quotes from US political figures on each side of mounted American flags. The quotes were in a Gothic style script typeface once favored by Hitler\\'s Third Reich. On the floor was an excerpt of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech and expression. Lined up against the wall were a dozen garbage cans with speakers emitting military marching sounds. Haacke notes that \"freedom of expression is the focus of the work\".\\n\\n\\n=== Commissions ===\\nIn 2000, the permanent installation DER BEVÖLKERUNG (To the Population) was inaugurated in the Reichstag, the German Parliament building in Berlin, and in 2006, a public commission commemorating Rosa Luxemburg was completed in a three-block area in the center of the city. In 2014, it was announced that Haacke would be installing one of his works as part of the annual Fourth Plinth commission in 2015. His winning commission of a bronze sculpture of a horse’s skeleton, titled Gift Horse, comes with an electronic ribbon tied to its front leg that displays a live ticker of prices on the London Stock Exchange.\\n\\n\\n=== Use of Law ===\\nAlong with Adrian Piper and Michael Asher, Haacke uses a version of Seth Siegelaub and Robert Projansky\\'s 1971 artist contract, The Artists Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement, in order to control the dissemination, display and ownership of his art works.\\n\\n\\n== Writing and publications ==\\nOn being considered a political artist Haacke says: \"it is uncomfortable for me to be a politicized artist.... the work of an artist with such a label is in danger of being understood one dimensionally without exception.... all artwork have a political component whether its intended or not\". Jack Burnham comments on Haacke\\'s political growth and links its roots to exposure to a time of political unrest in the US surrounding the Vietnam War. Burnham also points to Haacke\\'s joining the Arts Workers Coalition and the boycott of the São Paulo Bienal in Brazil in 1969 as catalyst for the artist\\'s work to take a political direction. Writing by Haacke and his close friends and colleagues, including documentation of his work, are collected in two separate books by the artist.\\nHans Haacke first published a book about the ideas and processes behind his and other conceptual art called Framing and Being Framed. Published in 1995, Free Exchange, is a transcription of a conversation between Haacke and Pierre Bourdieu. The two men met in the 1980s and, as Bourdieu states in the introduction, \"very quickly discovered how much they have in common\".\\n\\n\\n== Notable works in public collections ==\\nCondensation Cube (1963), Generali Foundation, Vienna (on permanent loan to Museum der Moderne Salzburg); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; and Tate, London\\nBlue Sail (1964-1965), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\\nCondensation Wall (1963/1966), National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\\nShapolsky et al.

              "  'Bruno Fonseca (1958 – May 31, 1994) was an American artist who shifted between abstract and figurative styles and worked in both painting and sculpture.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nFonseca was born in New York to a family of artists. His father, Gonzalo Fonseca, was an Uruguayan sculptor. His younger brother Caio Fonseca is a well known contemporary painter. His sister Isabel Fonseca is a writer. Fonseca had dyslexia and a stutter, conditions so severe as a child he was treated by a psychiatrist. Fonseca was able to compensate for his verbal difficulties with a tremendous visual fluency, reproducing paintings by Michelangelo and other Great Masters at an early age. Raised in a house on West Eleventh Street in Greenwich Village, Fonseca studied at the Dalton School in Manhattan and St. Ann\\'s School in Brooklyn Heights. Fonseca failed to graduate from high school and at age 18, he moved to Barcelona, where he studied with Augusto Torres. Fonseca lived in Barcelona until 1993, when he returned to New York a few months before his death.\\nFonseca had what his sister called \"a slightly perverse anti-taste for exquisite goods and \\'luxuries\\' of all kinds.\" He preferred old objects, old clothes and junk that he collected from the streets of Barcelona. He chose to live in Barcelona\\'s red-light district, among the city\\'s poor, cripples, addicts, street girls, and bohemians.\\n\\n\\n=== Career ===\\nLate in his life, Fonseca painted four large paintings known as \"The War Murals\" depicting scenes of warfare. The individual works are titled Tank (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 269.2 cm) Fire (oil on canvas, 207 x 284.5 cm), Bucharest (oil on canvas, 208.2 x 279.4 cm), and Timișoara (oil on canvas, 210.8 x 271.7 cm). One writer described the anti-war theme in \"The War Murals\", begun in 1989 and finished in 1993, as \"the most powerful statement of their kind since Picasso\\'s great Guernica.\" The murals were inspired by images of boy soldiers torn from the newspaper and by images of violence in Eastern Europe, including the public execution of Nicolae Ceauşescu. His sister recalled watching scenes of the upheavals in Eastern Europe on CNN with Bruno and wrote: \"The War Murals - Bruno\\'s four larger narrative paintings inspired by the anti-communist upheavals - represent his greatest synthesis of abstract and representational painting, something he had struggled for throughout his working life.\" Fonseca worked on the murals for several years, finishing them while he was suffering from the effects of AIDS. A public showing of \"The War Murals\" was the opening exhibition for the John McEnroe Gallery in SoHo in January 1994. Fonseca also had a solo show at New York\\'s Salander-O\\'Reilly in 1993.\\nAfter contracting AIDS, Fonseca returned to New York. He married his pupil, German painter Anke Blaue, shortly before his death. He died of AIDS in 1994 at age 36.\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==',\n",
              "  'Jesse Beau Richards (born July 17, 1975) is a painter, filmmaker and photographer from New Haven, Connecticut and was affiliated with the international movement Stuckism. He has been described as \"one of the most provocative names in American underground culture,\" and \"the father of remodernist cinema.\"\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nJesse Richards was born in New Haven. He had an ambition to be a forest ranger during his teens, which was also the time he started to make films. He studied film production at the School of Visual Arts, New York City, which he left after a nervous breakdown. He directed plays including Hamlet and Look Back In Anger for the New Haven Theatre Company, and made short romance and punk films.\\nIn 1999, Richards was arrested for reckless burning, destruction of property and disorderly conduct. After the charges were dropped, he began painting.\\n\\n\\n== Stuckism ==\\nRichards is affiliated with the Stuckist art movement in 2001 and founded a gallery as the first Stuckism center in the United States in 2002, helping to organize shows. The center opened its doors with a show entitled \"We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings.\"\\nIn 2003, an anti-war \"Clown Trial of President Bush\" took place outside the New Haven Federal Courthouse, in order to \"highlight the fact that the Iraq War does not have the support of the United Nations, thus violating a binding contract with the UN\". It was staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by Richards with Nicholas Watson and Tony Juliano. One of the participants was a public defender for the state of Connecticut.\\nSimultaneously the Stuckism center opened a War on Bush show, including work from Brazil, Australia, Germany and the UK, while the London equivalent staged a War on Blair show. Richards said the original intention of a straightforward art show to an anti-war show had been changed after a phone discussion with Stuckism founder, Charles Thomson. Richards told The Yale Herald, \"Duchamp would go over to the Yale University Art Gallery and he would say, \\'This is crap,\\' and he would go paint a picture.\"\\n\\nAlso in 2003, Richards was an exhibitor in the UK show, Stuck in Wednesbury at Wednesbury Museum & Art Gallery, the first Stuckist show in a public gallery, and in The Stuckists Summer Show at the Stuckism International Gallery, London.\\nIn 2004, Richards was one of eight artists in the \"International Stuckists\" section of The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery during the Liverpool Biennial. He said of his exhibited work, Nightlife: \"This came out of heavy drinking and loneliness. New Haven\\'s social scene is entirely going to bars, so it was my only way to meet new people.\"\\n\\nRichards reviewed the Biennial and the Stuckist show, where he found Joe Machine\\'s My Grandfather Will Fight You, \"one of the best Stuckist paintings. Machine\\'s work is the epitome of raw, real expressive painting.\" He said that Stuckist Photographer Andy Bullock\\'s work was \"silly installation photography\" which was \"trying to be trendy.\"\\nIn 2005, 160 paintings from the Walker Art Gallery show, including one by Richards, were offered as a donation to the Tate gallery, but rejected by Sir Nicholas Serota, because \"We do not feel that the work is of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant preservation in perpetuity in the national collection\".\\nIn 2005, Richards was a co-ordinator of, and participated in, Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism, the first Remodernism exhibition in the US to include work from all of the Remodernist groups, including the Stuckists, the Defastenists, Remodernist Film and Photography, and Stuckism Photography. The show took place at the CBGB 313 gallery.\\nIn 2006, Richards was one of the artists in The Triumph of Stuckism, a show at Liverpool John Moores University Hope Street Gallery, curated by Naive John at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Research at Liverpool School of Art and Design, and part of the Liverpool Biennial 2006.\\nRichards left the Stuckist movement in 2006.\\n\\n\\n== Shows ==\\n\\nStuckist group shows organized or featuring work by Richards include:\\n\\n2002 We Just Wanna Show Some Fucking Paintings – New Haven\\n2003 War on Bush – New Haven\\n2003 Stuck in Wednesbury – Wednesbury\\n2003 The Stuckists Summer Show – London\\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian – Liverpool Biennial\\n2004 The Stuckists Punk Victorian In the Toilet – New Haven\\n2005 Addressing the Shadow and Making Friends with Wild Dogs: Remodernism – New York City\\n2006 The Triumph of Stuckism – Liverpool Biennial\\n\\n\\n== Film and photography ==\\nRichards has worked on films with Nicholas Watson since 1996. Their film noir, Blackout, was premiered at the event Stuck Films at the New Haven Stuckism International Center in 2002.\\nIn 2003, Richards co-produced Shooting at the Moon, a short film premiering at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. In 2008, the film made its London premiere at Horse Hospital during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Richards said that his films had previously often contained nudity, but this time he wanted to do the opposite and the two leads do not quite even kiss:\\n\\nWhile making this film I guess the main thing we were thinking about accomplishing was to express this emotional experience, and have people really feel it, and not to get too complicated with story or anything that would distract from this feeling we wanted people to have while watching the film.\\nA book of pinhole photography called \"Dark Chamber\", featuring new work by Richards as well as work by Wolf Howard, Billy Childish and others was published by Urban Fox Press in May 2007.\\nBrian Sherwin said of Richards that his work was \"Street truth\":\\n\\nHis work may seem crude to some, but at least it is honest (sometimes brutally honest.) This honesty is captured by his ability to convey human behavior and struggles with each shot from his camera.\\nIn February 2010, the Australian film magazine Filmink announced Richards\\' participation in a compilation feature film by the Remodernist film movement. The film is scheduled to premiere in New York in December 2010.\\nIn December 2010, Richards joined the Board of Directors of Cine Foundation International.\\nRichards currently lives in Granby, Massachusetts.\\n\\n\\n=== Remodernist film movement ===\\n\\nIn 2004, Richards and fellow filmmaker Harris Smith co-founded Remodernist Film and Photography, a new Remodernist group attempting to introduce Remodernist/Stuckist values into film and photography.\\nIn 2008, Richards published a Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a \"new spirituality in cinema\" and the use of intuition in filmmaking. He described Remodernist film as a \"stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking\",. Point four of the manifesto is:\\n\\nThe Japanese ideas of wabi-sabi (the beauty of imperfection) and mono no aware (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.\\nThere were also criticisms of Stanley Kubrick, digital video, and Dogme 95.\\nIn late August 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto.  The filmmakers include Jesse Richards, Harris Smith, Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, Peter Rinaldi and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of the Netherlands, Rouzbeh Rashidi of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.\\nIn October 2009, with the intention \"to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts\", a series of articles by Richards, Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine MungBeing In Richards\\' two essays in the magazine, he explains the development of cinema in terms of modernism, postmodernism and remodernism, and discusses remodernist film craft as involving filmmakers \"teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft\". He also relaxes the criticisms made in the manifesto about digital video, claiming that can \"have a place in Remodernist cinema\", but with a \"new language\" and not in the way it is used now, which he says is to \"mimic film\".\\nHe describes his specific approach to Remodernist filmmaking as well:\\n\\n ... my own interests are a little more specific. I\\'m interested in Japanese aesthetics, Tarkovsky\\'s ideas on \"sculpting in time\", an emphasis on moments. But there\\'s something else I\\'ve really been thinking about lately. I believe that the most effective way to really make subjective and authentic work involves an \"addressing of the shadow\" (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, or maybe you are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child.\\nThese things, these \"shadows\" that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day – in our films, in our work, in our poetry. It\\'s necessary for us to share these parts of ourselves so we and the people we share with can grow into complete, honest human beings. Now, this kind of brutal honesty about ourselves shown through imagery that isn\\'t shy, has been explored to a degree in the work from the Cinema of Transgression, and is advocated by Antonin Artaud in his writings about the Theatre of Cruelty, and his later writings on cinema. But I don\\'t think it\\'s quite as simple as just that. As human beings, we are also full of beauty and love and poetry – we can see this in ourselves and in others and in the world around us. So this beauty must be explored as well, and in combination with the exploration of the shadow. The funny thing is that if we would just be honest as filmmakers, or painters, or as whatever we happen to work with, if we could be this honest, this approach would happen automatically. But we are told again and again- these things don\\'t go together, don\\'t tell people about that thing that you can\\'t get out of your head- that image is inappropriate. We\\'ve become very afraid of just expressing ourselves honestly, of removing the desperate attempts to appear clever, we\\'ve been afraid of showing our true selves out of fear that others will think us fools. So this is where Artaud, the Cinema of Transgression, and even Andrei Tarkovsky have not gone quite the distance. The cinematic exploration of spirituality and transgression together – pubic hair, blood and shit and love and the green grass and the dying cherry blossoms, falling snow, passing trains – every single fucking beautiful piece of life – that is what my conception of Remodernist film is.\\nThe articles also broaden the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\nFrank\\'s Wild Years, 1994/1995\\nI Wonder, 1996\\nSex and Lies, 1998 (destroyed except for trailer)\\nBlackout, 2000\\nShooting at the Moon, 1998.

She was a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Newcastle.\\n\\n\\n\\nMiller was born on 9 May 1949 in Rumburk, then part of Czechoslovakia, as the oldest in a family of five children. After attempting to escape Czechoslovakia in 1968, stopped because of her companion's illness, she became a student at Charles University before successfully escaping in 1969 and becoming a refugee in Australia.\\nMiller earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Sydney in 1976, both in mathematics and computer science,\\nand as a student also played volleyball for the New South Wales team and then the Australia women's national volleyball team.\\nShe married ornithologist Ben Miller, became a computer programmer working with the Sydney Morning Herald and for NSW Parks and Wildlife on Lord Howe Island, and began raising a son with Miller.\\nShe separated from her husband and returned to graduate study, earning two master's degrees from the University of New England in 1983 and 1986; her mentors in these degrees were Ernie Bowen and Ivan Friš. She completed a PhD from the University of New South Wales in 1990. Her dissertation, Security of Statistical Databases, was supervised by Jennifer Seberry.\\nShe held academic positions at the University of New England from 1982 to 1991, but after marrying graph theorist \\nJoe Ryan they both moved to the University of Newcastle. She was a faculty member at the University of Newcastle from 1992 to 2004, when she temporarily moved to the University of Ballarat, and returned to Newcastle as a research professor from 2008 until her retirement. At Newcastle, she spent many years as the only woman in the Faculty of Engineering. She retired as a professor emeritus in 2014.\\nShe also held a position at the University of West Bohemia as Conjoint Professor since 2001.\\nShe died of gastroesophageal cancer on 2 January 2016.

              " 'Irmgard Flügge-Lotz, née Lotz (16 July 1903 – 22 May 1974) was a German-American mathematician and aerospace engineer. She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in hysteresis control systems; such applications include guidance systems, electronics, fire-control systems, and temperature regulation. She became the first female engineering professor at Stanford University in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\\n\\n\\n\\nLotz was born in Hamelin, Germany on 16 July 1903. She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films. After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist, was drafted for military service in World War I, the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls\\' Gymnasium in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family. She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the Leibniz University Hannover to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:\\n\\nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.\\nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes. In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.\\nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in Göttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe. She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use. She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally. Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.\\nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz\\'s career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics. However, Flügge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\". The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research. Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann Göring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.\\nAt DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems. These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application. She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany. After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d\\'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz\\'s reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.\\nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory. At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers. In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:\\n\\nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.\\nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant. The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag. During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:\\n\\nProfessor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman\\'s intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.\\nShe was also a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a member of Sigma Xi, and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.\\nIn honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award\" was established by the Applied Mechanics Division at Stanford University for outstanding graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz\\'s health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from arthritis that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in Stanford Hospital after a long illness.\\n\\n\\n\\nDie Erwärmung des Stempels beim Stauchvorgang, Dissertation TH Hannover 1929\\nDiscontinuous Automatic Control, Princeton University Press 1953\\nDiscontinuous and Optimal Control, McGraw Hill 1968\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.

              " 'Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian: Софья Васильевна Ковалевская), born Korvin-Krukovskaya (15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1850 – 10 February 1891), was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was \"the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century\".:\\u200a255\\u200a\\nHistorian of mathematics Roger Cooke writes:\\n\\n... the more I reflect on her life and consider the magnitude of her achievements, set against the weight of the obstacles she had to overcome, the more I admire her.  For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\n\\nHer sister was the socialist Anne Jaclard.\\nThere are several alternative transliterations of her name. She herself used Sophie Kowalevski (or occasionally Kowalevsky) in her academic publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (née Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the Imperial Russian Army as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Polibino, his family estate in Pskov Oblast in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian–Polish descent (Polish on his father\\'s side), with possible partial ancestry from the royal Corvin family of Hungary, and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father\\'s side.)\\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor Schubert (1758−1825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya\\'s maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789−1865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father\\'s student days. She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies. Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of A. N. Strannoliubskii. In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.\\nAlthough the word nihilist (нигилист) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (шестидесятники):\\n\\nAfter the famous writer Ivan Turgenev used the word nihilist to refer to Bazarov, the young hero of his 1862 novel Fathers and Children, a certain segment of the \"new people\" adopted that name as well, despite its negative connotations in most quarters.... For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.:\\u200a2–4\\u200a \\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn April 1869, following Sofia\\'s and Vladimir\\'s brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained permission to audit classes with the professors\\' approval at the University of Heidelberg.  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.:\\u200a87–89\\u200a  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to the University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot\\'s Sunday salons. There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot\\'s instigation, on \"woman\\'s capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing Middlemarch at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke\\'s mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\" This was well before Kovalevskaya\\'s notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.:\\u200a104–106\\u200a With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia\\'s and Anyuta\\'s father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, Jaclard was saved.:\\u200a107–108\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn\\'s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.\\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity of local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her sex.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.\\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.\\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden. Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler\\'s sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya\\'s death the two women shared a close friendship.\\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d\\'un corps pesant autour d\\'un point fixe, où l\\'intégration s\\'effectue à l\\'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\". Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"Kovalevskaya top\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is \"completely integrable\" other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.\\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.:\\u200a218\\u200a After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the academy\\'s rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, A Russian Childhood, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, Nihilist Girl (1890).\\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband, but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.:\\u200a18\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya died of epidemic influenza complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.:\\u200a231\\u200a She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s mathematical results, such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz, a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina (translated into English by M. Burov with the title Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R.

In other words, a graph is semi-symmetric if each vertex has the same number of incident edges, and there is a symmetry taking any of the graph\\'s edges to any other of its edges, but there is some pair of vertices such that no symmetry maps the first into the second.\\n\\n\\n\\nA semi-symmetric graph must be bipartite, and its automorphism group must act transitively on each of the two vertex sets of the bipartition (in fact, regularity is not required for this property to hold).  For instance, in the diagram of the Folkman graph shown here, green vertices can not be mapped to red ones by any automorphism, but every two vertices of the same color are symmetric with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nSemi-symmetric graphs were first studied E. Dauber, a student of F. Harary, in a paper, no longer available, titled \"On line- but not point-symmetric graphs\".  This was seen by Jon Folkman, whose paper, published in 1967, includes the smallest semi-symmetric graph, now known as the Folkman graph, on 20 vertices.\\nThe term \"semi-symmetric\" was first used by Klin et al. in a paper they published in 1978.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph (that is, one in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) is the Gray graph on 54 vertices. It was first observed to be semi-symmetric by Bouwer (1968). It was proven to be the smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph by Dragan Marušič and Aleksander Malnič.\\nAll the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 10000 vertices are known. According to Conder, Malnič, Marušič and Potočnik, the four smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graphs after the Gray graph are the Iofinova–Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the Ljubljana graph on 112 vertices, a graph on 120 vertices with girth 8 and the Tutte 12-cage.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Paulson began working as a mathematician at JPL in 1948, where she calculated rocket trajectories by hand. She is among the women who made early progress at JPL.\\n\\n\\n\\nBarbara Jean Lewis was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 11, 1928. She was raised with three siblings \\n(two older sisters and one younger brother), and when she was 12 years old her father died. Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well. In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin.\\nIn 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia. In 1975 they finally settled in Glendora.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 as a computer, calculating rocket paths and working on the MGM-5 Corporal, the first guided missile designed by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. Paulson and her colleagues were at one point invited to sign their names on the 100th Corporal rocket prior to its transport to the White Sands test range. The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff. On January 31, 1958, Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper. The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal to carry a warhead over 200 miles.\\nIn 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, she and her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant woman on staff would result in insurance policy problems. JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth. Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who had been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab. Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time. At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'.\\nIn the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars. Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target. In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab.\\n\\nIn the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars. Paulson successfully calculated the trajectory the Viking probe needed on its 11-month transit between Earth and Mars. Paulson's calculations also proved to be essential during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase of the mission in which the lander would detach from the spacecraft, enter the martian atmosphere, and parachute down to the surface. In the late 1970s Paulson and her colleagues worked on some of the first interstellar trajectories during the planning of the Voyager missions in which Voyager 1, having launched in September 1977, and as of April 13, 2019 is the most distant from Earth of all human-made objects.\\nPaulson retired from JPL in 1993 and remained in Pasadena until 2003 before moving to Iowa.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson and her husband Harry had daughters Karen (née Paulson) Bishop and Kathleen (née Paulson) Knutson, four grandchildren (Jonathan, Kyle, Harrison, and Corrine), and several nieces and nephews.  Throughout pregnancy and her eventual return to work at JPL, Barbara's husband at the time was a real estate appraiser and member of the Pasadena Board of Realtors. Fortunately, upon Barbara's return to work Harry was able to adjust his schedule, as did many of the other human computers with children, to ensure that their children were taken care of.\\nBarbara Paulson's husband Harry Murray Paulson died on July 9, 2003, they were married 44 years. In 2003, Paulson sold her home following her husband's death, and moved to Iowa to be closer to her daughters and their families.\\nBarbara Paulson died in Des Moines, Iowa on February 26, 2023, at the age of 94.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1959 Paulson was recognized and received her 10-year pin for her work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Paulson would work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 45 years, and retire in 1993.

The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. In 1923, she graduated from the University of Bristol with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\\nShe returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard-Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master\\'s thesis.

They were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hassé, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge; Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the Bristol University College, soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hassé joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.:\\u200a111\\u200a Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus. Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was \"the best teacher he had ever had.\"\\nDent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\\n\\nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course. Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn June 1923, Dent graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours. On 7 July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge. On her death in 1922, Lilias Sophia Ashworth Hallett left one thousand pounds each to the University of Bristol and Girton College, University of Cambridge, to found scholarships for women.:\\u200a259,\\u200a261\\u200a The University of Bristol scholarship was open to women graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth £45 at the time (equivalent to £3,200 in 2023). She spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification. Before 1948, the University of Cambridge denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as she left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDent spent the summer of 1924 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, playing mixed doubles tennis in a tournament organised by the local Women\\'s Unionist Association. In September of the same year, she was appointed an assistant teacher in mathematics at the High School for Girls, in Barnsley, Huddersfield Road, on an annual salary of £250 (equivalent to £18,000 in 2023). Annie Rose Nuttall, the school\\'s head teacher, was a former student at Newnham College. In the early 1920s, women who had studied university level mathematics faced limited employment prospects, as mathematics and engineering professions, other than perhaps school teaching, were dominated by men. Dent resigned her position on 31 August 1925 after being appointed a demonstrator (research assistant) in the Department of Physics at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).:\\u200a107\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens. From August 1925, John Lennard-Jones, of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, was elected reader in mathematical physics. In March 1927, Lennard‑Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.:\\u200a24\\u200a Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.\\nLennard‑Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals. Dent\\'s thesis for her master\\'s degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard‑Jones, \"Some theoretical determinations of crystal parameters. CXVI\", and with Lennard‑Jones and Sydney Chapman, \"Structure of carbonate crystals\" and \"Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals\". On 28 June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work. In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help. Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\", and with Sydney Chapman, \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage. Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. Lennard‑Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Göttingen. She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: \"The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal\" (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides. In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park, Manchester.:\\u200a14–15\\u200a\\nIn December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the university council. Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1 February 1930. Littleton was later Sir Neville Mott\\'s co-author and research assistant in the physics department.:\\u200a517\\u200a In 1930, Lennard‑Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.\\n\\n\\n\\nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well-known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines, and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer. In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new \"technical intelligence\" section.:\\u200a193\\u200a In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the University of Birmingham, and past member of the first standing committee of ASLIB.:\\u200a228\\u200a Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.:\\u200a193\\u200a In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6 January 1930.:\\u200a15\\u200a She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,:\\u200a314\\u200a and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.:\\u200a193\\u200a\\nDent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.:\\u200a204–205\\u200a In 1932, the branch had twenty-six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.:\\u200a412\\u200a Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.:\\u200a301\\u200a By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan-Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications. Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.\\n\\nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\" (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell. In 1937, David Myers, then at the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Oxford, asked Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter to calculate the space charge limitation of secondary current in a triode.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a96\\u200a The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a differential analyser. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a97\\u200a Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in \"The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines\" (1950). She would later analyse the problem of stress distribution in a thick disk based on a method devised by Philip Pollock, for Richard William Bailey, the former director of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical sections of the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.:\\u200a16\\u200a\\nDent was a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government\\'s conference dinner on 22 September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, she was elected to the editing committee of the ASLIB book list. In 1944, she was put in charge of the women working in the research department laboratory at Metropolitan-Vickers, and in 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the new computation section. Her role would bring her into contact with Audrey Stuckes, a materials science researcher in the department, and a graduate of Newnham College, who would later head the physics department at the University of Salford. In 1953, they collaborated on an investigation into the heating effects that occur when a current is passed through a semiconductor that has no barrier layer. Dent suggested methods to solve the equations and computed the numerical integrations. In the following year, she developed the Fourier analysis in \"Regenerative Deflection as a Parametrically Excited Resonance Phenomenon\" (1954), that calculated the optimal radial oscillations to maintain cyclotron resonance in a synchrocyclotron. The causes of axial spreading of the charged particle beam during extraction were also analysed.\\nDent joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Ferranti Mark 1 (Mark 1) computer at the University of Manchester, that demonstrated that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer. Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services. In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor. A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.\\nIn 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed Zeta circuit on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill\\'s paper on constructing a high-power pulse transformer and circuit. The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds (equivalent to £59,000 in 2023), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time. She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.:\\u200a232\\u200a:\\u200a243\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1920s, Dent was living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton. May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House, and Dent returned to Bristol on 22 December 1934 for Staveley\\'s funeral. Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association, and secretary and treasurer of the group of former Clifton Hill House students.:\\u200a1, 9\\u200a She would later write \"I was very sorry indeed to leave Bristol and have many happy memories of my time there. I shall miss living at the [Clifton Hill House] Hall very much.\":\\u200a15\\u200a\\nIn 1926, Dent was elected treasurer of the University of Bristol\\'s Convocation, the university\\'s alumni association. In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the Convocation:\\u200a62\\u200a She later represented the Manchester branch of the association. Around 1926, Dent was appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association. The association\\'s aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University. In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women\\'s International League in October 1928.\\n\\nIn July 1929, in Dent\\'s last year at Bristol, she went on holiday to North Devon with friends that included Gertrude Roxbee, known as \"Rox\", who had graduated with Dent in 1923 with a BSc in botany.:\\u200a12–13\\u200a After moving to Manchester in January 1930, Dent found shared lodgings at 10 Montrose Avenue, West Didsbury, in the same house as Roxbee who, at that time, was a teacher at Whalley Range High School.:\\u200a15, 50\\u200a At weekends, she would ramble to Hebden Bridge, and with Roxbee, learnt to figure skate at the Ice Palace, a former ice rink on Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.:\\u200a54\\u200a\\nIn September 1930, she returned to Bristol for the ninety-eighth conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (British Association), meeting her friends at an alumnae association lunch.:\\u200a93\\u200a In the afternoon of the 4 September 1930, she toured Avonmouth Docks as a conference member,:\\u200a94\\u200a and in the evening, was invited to a reception held by Walter Bryant, the then lord mayor of Bristol, at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.:\\u200a94\\u200a. On the following day, she visited an aircraft manufacturer at Whitchurch Airport and attended a garden party at Wills Hall.:\\u200a94\\u200a On the Monday of the conference, Dent was in the audience to see Paul Dirac present his paper on the proton and the structure of matter.:\\u200a94\\u200a She would later comment::\\u200a94\\u200a\\n\\nI heard a striking paper by Dirac, who was a student with me, who is now a very famous person, as I always knew he would be ... I now go about boasting that I was in the same class!\\nDent\\'s father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King\\'s Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St Matthew\\'s Church, Stretford. She had close links to St Matthew\\'s; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St Matthew\\'s Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1962, Dent and her mother moved from Stretford to 1 Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing. Her mother died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10 April 1967. Dent\\'s sister, Florence Mary, also lived in the house until her death on 13 September 1986(1986-09-13) (aged 84). After a brief period as a teacher at a prep school in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, Florence worked as a secretary for a marine insurance firm attached to Lloyd\\'s of London at 12 Leadenhall Street, commuting into London from Harrow each day.:\\u200a57–59\\u200a\\nBeryl May Dent died at Worthing Hospital on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged 77) after a long period of disablement. The funeral service was held on 12 August 1977 at St Mary\\'s Church, Sompting, followed by cremation. Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the book of remembrance at the crematorium states:\\n\\nBeryl May Dent 1900 – A real Christian loved by all – 1977\\nThere is also a memorial to her at the Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting. The bishop\\'s chair, situated close to the altar, bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:\\n\\nIn loving memory of BERYL DENT 1900 – 1977\\nHer Christian faith is perhaps not unexpected, given her father\\'s work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life. However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn archive of Dent\\'s papers, that relate to her life and work in the 1920s in the physics department at the University of Bristol, is held in the Special Collections of the University of Bristol Arts and Social Sciences Library, in Tyndall Avenue, Bristol. Included in that archive is a series of letterbooks, written in the 1930s by members of the Clifton Hill House Old Students\\' Association, that include news and photographs of Dent, her family, and friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\" and \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface. They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).:\\u200a796–797\\u200a The expression for the potential in vacuum, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          φ\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          (\\n          r\\n          )\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varphi _{0}\\\\left(r\\\\right)}\\n  \\n, at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          e\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle e_{k}}\\n  \\n, and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form::\\u200a797\\u200a\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          r\\n          \\n            ∥\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          {\\n          \\n            x\\n            ,\\n            y\\n          \\n          }\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle r_{\\\\parallel }=\\\\left\\\\{x,y\\\\right\\\\}}\\n  \\n is the lateral vector that fixes the observation point coordinates in the sample plane.\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            l\\n            ,\\n            m\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{l,m}}\\n  \\n is the reciprocal lattice vector.\\ns is the number of planes to be calculated inside the crystal; s set to zero would calculate the surface plane.\\nThe expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower planes of the crystal lattice. Lennard‑Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.:\\u200a797\\u200a Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,:\\u200a481\\u200a had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.\\nMichael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in surface and colloid chemistry at Loughborough University of Technology and professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, concurred with Buckley, noting that \"an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal ... is obviously extremely improbable.\" However, they acknowledged that the Lennard‑Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally. Nonetheless, Lennard‑Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.:\\u200a14\\u200a Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and Paul Hansma, has shown that this result has direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.:\\u200a543\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.:\\u200a1\\u200a If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by 𝜆, then the reduced major axis method assumes that 𝜆 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of x and y. RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nIn Dent\\'s 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\", she admitted that when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown, \"we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions.\" However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of Gaussian error functions, she contended that this expression may be regarded as \"a function of the unknown quantities\", or the likelihood function of the data distribution.:\\u200a106\\u200a Furthermore, she argued that maximising this function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation,:\\u200a5\\u200a subject to the condition that the points are collinear, will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the centroid and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.:\\u200a106\\u200a\\nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        θ\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\theta }\\n  \\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:\\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n are the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          X\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {X} }\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          Y\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {Y} }\\n  \\n vectors in a covariance matrix giving the covariance between each pair of x and y variables.

Furthermore, Albert Madansky, late H. G. B. Alexander professor of business administration at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x^{T}y}\\n  \\n is negative.:\\u200a201–203\\u200a\\nRichard J. Smith has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in \"A Problem in Least Squares\" (1878) and Charles Kummell in \"Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity\" (1879). It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope, and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.:\\u200a106\\u200a Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.:\\u200a3\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency. On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, \"The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers.

Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers. It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in \"A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer\" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She attended the lycée in Tarbes, the nearest town large enough for that level of school, and then spent two years in a preparatory mathematics course for entrance to the grandes écoles in Toulouse, where her sister worked as a teacher.\\nShe became a student at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in 1965. Her instructors included Gustave Choquet, Henri Cartan, and Laurent Schwartz. After her son was born in 1967, her mother came to live with her in Paris to help take care of him. At approximately the same time, she became interested in model theory through a book by Georg Kreisel and Jean-Louis Krivine. She took part in a student protest in 1968, part of the May 1968 events in France, in which most of the students refused to take the oral part of the agrégation exam, but their resistance to the exam did not last and she completed her agrégation in 1969.\\nFollowing this she became a student at the University of Paris, studying mathematical logic, and when it split into multiple universities in 1970 she chose to go to Paris Diderot University. She completed her doctorate there in 1972.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile still a doctoral student, Artigue became a faculty member at what would become Paris Diderot University in 1969. In part as fallout from the student protests, in the same year, the Institute of Research in Mathematics Education (IREM) was founded at the university, with André Revuz as its director, and Revuz invited Artigue to become one of its members. Through her involvement with the institute, her interests shifted from logic to mathematics education.\\nArtigue directed IREM from 1985 to 1988. She then moved to the University Institute for Teacher Education of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, where she took a full professorship and became head of the mathematics department. She returned to Paris Diderot University and to the directorship of IREM in 1999, and retired as an emeritus professor in 2010.\\nShe also served as president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction from 2007 to 2010.\\n\\n\\n\\nArtigue\\'s early work in mathematics education focused on derivatives and integrals and on the graphical representation of functions.

              " 'The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions\\nand functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.\\nA simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat\\'s principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, which depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.\\nMany important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet\\'s principle. Plateau\\'s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical formulation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations may be said to begin with Newton\\'s minimal resistance problem in 1687, followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli (1696). It immediately occupied the attention of Jacob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l\\'Hôpital, but  Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject, beginning in 1733. Lagrange was influenced by Euler\\'s work to contribute significantly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange, Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange\\'s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his 1756 lecture Elementa Calculi Variationum.\\nLegendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject. To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Poisson (1831), Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The 20th and the 23rd Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further development.\\nIn the 20th century David Hilbert, Oskar Bolza, Gilbert Ames Bliss, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps functions to scalars, so functionals have been described as \"functions of functions.\"  Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n of a given function space defined over a given domain.

The extremum \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        J\\n        [\\n        f\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle J[f]}\\n  \\n is called a local maximum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≤\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J\\\\leq 0}\\n  \\n everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f,}\\n  \\n and a local minimum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≥\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta J\\\\geq 0}\\n  \\n there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.\\nBoth strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the converse may not hold.  Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema. An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler–Lagrange equation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero).  The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equation.\\nConsider the functional\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n

Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations in the interior.\\nHowever Lavrentiev in 1926 showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections. The Lavrentiev Phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions. For instance the following problem, presented by Manià in 1934:\\n\\nClearly, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        (\\n        t\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          t\\n          \\n            \\n              1\\n              3\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x(t)=t^{\\\\frac {1}{3}}}\\n  \\nminimizes the functional, but we find any function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        ∈\\n        \\n          W\\n          \\n            1\\n            ,\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x\\\\in W^{1,\\\\infty }}\\n  \\n gives a value bounded away from the infimum.\\nExamples (in one-dimension) are traditionally manifested across \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          W\\n          \\n            1\\n            ,\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W^{1,1}}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          W\\n          \\n            1\\n            ,\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W^{1,\\\\infty },}\\n  \\n but Ball and Mizel procured the first functional that displayed Lavrentiev\\'s Phenomenon across \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          W\\n          \\n            1\\n            ,\\n            p\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W^{1,p}}\\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          W\\n          \\n            1\\n            ,\\n            q\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle W^{1,q}}\\n  \\n for \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n        ≤\\n        p\\n        <\\n        q\\n        <\\n        ∞\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 1\\\\leq p<q<\\\\infty .}\\n  \\n There are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur - for instance \\'standard growth\\', a Lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable, or an approximating sequence satisfying Cesari\\'s Condition (D) - but results are often particular, and applicable to a small class of functionals. \\nConnected with the Lavrentiev Phenomenon is the repulsion property: any functional displaying Lavrentiev\\'s Phenomenon will display the weak repulsion property.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        φ\\n        (\\n        x\\n        ,\\n        y\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\varphi (x,y)}\\n  \\n denotes the displacement of a membrane above the domain \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        D\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle D}\\n  \\n in the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        ,\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x,y}\\n  \\n plane, then its potential energy is proportional to its surface area:\\n\\nPlateau\\'s problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        D\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle D}\\n  \\n; the solutions are called minimal surfaces.

              " 'Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems; it is the study of ergodicity. In this context, \"statistical properties\" refers to properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.\\nErgodic theory, like probability theory, is based on general notions of measure theory.  Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.\\nA central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set. Systems for which the Poincaré recurrence theorem holds are conservative systems; thus all ergodic systems are conservative.\\nMore precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a time average along each trajectory. For the special class of ergodic systems, this time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time \"forgets\" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as mixing and equidistribution, have also been extensively studied.\\nThe problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.\\nThe concepts of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis are central to applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErgodic theory is often concerned with ergodic transformations.  The intuition behind such transformations, which act on a given set, is that they do a thorough job \"stirring\" the elements of that set. E.g. if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout.  At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.\\nThe formal definition is as follows: \\nLet T : X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ), with μ(X) = 1.  Then T is ergodic if for every E in Σ with μ(T−1(E) Δ E) = 0 (that is, E is invariant), either μ(E) = 0 or μ(E) = 1.\\nThe operator Δ here is the symmetric difference of sets, equivalent to the exclusive-or operation with respect to set membership. The condition that the symmetric difference be measure zero is called being essentially invariant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn irrational rotation of the circle R/Z, T: x → x + θ, where θ is irrational, is ergodic. This transformation has even stronger properties of unique ergodicity, minimality, and equidistribution. By contrast, if θ = p/q is rational (in lowest terms) then T is periodic, with period q, and thus cannot be ergodic: for any interval I of length a, 0 < a < 1/q, its orbit under T (that is, the union of I, T(I), ..., Tq−1(I), which contains the image of I under any number of applications of T) is a T-invariant mod 0 set that is a union of q intervals of length a, hence it has measure qa strictly between 0 and 1.\\nLet G be a compact abelian group, μ the normalized Haar measure, and T a group automorphism of G. Let G* be the Pontryagin dual group, consisting of the continuous characters of G, and T* be the corresponding adjoint automorphism of G*. The automorphism T is ergodic if and only if the equality (T*)n(χ) = χ is possible only when n = 0 or χ is the trivial character of G. In particular, if G is the n-dimensional torus and the automorphism T is represented by a unimodular matrix A then T is ergodic if and only if no eigenvalue of A is a root of unity.\\nA Bernoulli shift is ergodic. More generally, ergodicity of the shift transformation associated with a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and some more general stationary processes follows from Kolmogorov\\'s zero–one law.\\nErgodicity of a continuous dynamical system means that its trajectories \"spread around\" the phase space. A system with a compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I functionally independent from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville\\'s theorem implies the existence of a finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is complete integrability.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet T: X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and suppose ƒ is a μ-integrable function, i.e. ƒ ∈ L1(μ). Then we define the following averages:\\n\\n Time average: This is defined as the average (if it exists) over iterations of T starting from some initial point x:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          lim\\n          \\n            n\\n            →\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            k\\n            =\\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n            −\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        f\\n        (\\n        \\n          T\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n        x\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}(x)=\\\\lim _{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty }\\\\;{\\\\frac {1}{n}}\\\\sum _{k=0}^{n-1}f(T^{k}x).}\\n  \\n\\n Space average: If μ(X) is finite and nonzero, we can consider the space or phase average of ƒ:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∫\\n        f\\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        .\\n        \\n        \\n           (For a probability space, \\n        \\n        μ\\n        (\\n        X\\n        )\\n        =\\n        1.\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\bar {f}}={\\\\frac {1}{\\\\mu (X)}}\\\\int f\\\\,d\\\\mu .\\\\quad {\\\\text{ (For a probability space, }}\\\\mu (X)=1.)}\\n  \\n\\nIn general the time average and space average may be different.

(Actually, Birkhoff\\'s paper considers not the abstract general case but only the case of dynamical systems arising from differential equations on a smooth manifold.) The equidistribution theorem is a special case of the ergodic theorem, dealing specifically with the distribution of probabilities on the unit interval.\\nMore precisely, the pointwise or strong ergodic theorem states that the limit in the definition of the time average of ƒ exists for almost every x and that the (almost everywhere defined) limit function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n is integrable:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∈\\n        \\n          L\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        μ\\n        )\\n        .\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\in L^{1}(\\\\mu ).\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nFurthermore, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n is T-invariant, that is to say\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∘\\n        T\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\circ T={\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nholds almost everywhere, and if μ(X) is finite, then the normalization is the same:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∫\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        =\\n        ∫\\n        f\\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\int {\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,d\\\\mu =\\\\int f\\\\,d\\\\mu .}\\n  \\n\\nIn particular, if T is ergodic, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\hat {f}}}\\n  \\n must be a constant (almost everywhere), and so one has that\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle {\\\\bar {f}}={\\\\hat {f}}\\\\,}\\n  \\n\\nalmost everywhere.

In fact, this result also extends to the case of strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of contractive operators on a reflexive space.\\nRemark: Some intuition for the mean ergodic theorem can be developed by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which we think of as U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, it makes sense that the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the  limit just described).\\n\\n\\n\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be as above a probability space with a measure preserving transformation T, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The conditional expectation with respect to the sub-σ-algebra ΣT of the T-invariant sets is a linear projector ET of norm 1 of the Banach space Lp(X, Σ, μ) onto its closed subspace Lp(X, ΣT, μ). The latter may also be characterized as the space of all T-invariant Lp-functions on X. The ergodic means, as linear operators on Lp(X, Σ, μ) also have unit operator norm; and, as a simple consequence of the Birkhoff–Khinchin theorem, converge to the projector ET in the strong operator topology of Lp if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and in the weak operator topology if p = ∞. More is true if 1 < p ≤ ∞ then the Wiener–Yoshida–Kakutani ergodic dominated convergence theorem states that the ergodic means of ƒ ∈ Lp are dominated in Lp; however, if ƒ ∈ L1, the ergodic means may fail to be equidominated in Lp.

The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on SL(2, R) was described in 1952 by S. V. Fomin and I. M. Gelfand. The article on Anosov flows provides an example of ergodic flows on SL(2, R) and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature.  Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the hyperbolic space by the action of a lattice in the semisimple Lie group SO(n,1). Ergodicity of the geodesic flow on Riemannian symmetric spaces was demonstrated by F. I. Mautner in 1957. In 1967 D. V. Anosov and Ya. G. Sinai proved ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative sectional curvature. A simple criterion for the ergodicity of a homogeneous flow on a homogeneous space of a semisimple Lie group was given by Calvin C. Moore in 1966.  Many of the theorems and results from this area of study are typical of rigidity theory.\\nIn the 1930s G. A. Hedlund proved that the horocycle flow on a compact hyperbolic surface is minimal and ergodic. Unique ergodicity of the flow was established by Hillel Furstenberg in 1972. Ratner\\'s theorems provide a major generalization of ergodicity for unipotent flows on the homogeneous spaces of the form Γ \\\\ G, where G is a Lie group and Γ is a lattice in G.\\nIn the last 20 years, there have been many works trying to find a measure-classification theorem similar to Ratner\\'s theorems but for diagonalizable actions, motivated by conjectures of Furstenberg and Margulis. An important partial result (solving those conjectures with an extra assumption of positive entropy) was proved by Elon Lindenstrauss, and he was awarded the Fields medal in 2010 for this result.\\n\\n\\n\\nChaos theory\\nErgodic hypothesis\\nErgodic process\\nKruskal principle\\nLindy effect\\nLyapunov time – the time limit to the predictability of the system\\nMaximal ergodic theorem\\nOrnstein isomorphism theorem\\nStatistical mechanics\\nSymbolic dynamics\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'Erika Pannwitz (May 26, 1904 in Hohenlychen, Germany – November 25, 1975 in Berlin) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometric topology. During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office (German: Auswärtiges Amt) colloquially known as Pers Z S. After the war, she became editor-in-chief of Zentralblatt MATH.\\n\\n\\n\\nErika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor School in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922.  She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and Göttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt. Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\\n\\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem posed to her through completely independent investigations; she has achieved this goal through the appropriate choice of new terms, through understanding and deep insight into the difficult material presented to her, through the mastery of older methods and their novel use, and has thus demonstrated her scientific maturity in this, her first dissertation.\\nSince, in my opinion, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective achievement in it exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the work submitted by Miss Pannwitz as a dissertation with the rating \"eximium\".\\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\\n\\nI certainly agree with Mr Hopf\\'s vote. Topology is one of the most promising but at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still in its infancy, so that any valuable result can only be achieved with a high degree of strong inventiveness. Through the present work, topology has been enriched by a series of extraordinarily beautiful theorems\\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.  The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik. This was due to the difficulty of women achieving an academic career in the 1930\\'s, who found their career path blocked into higher education. It was also due to Pannwitz along with many other German mathematicians not wanting to provide support to the Nazis, despite her excellent dissertion. From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort.  After Germany\\'s defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt für Mathematik, and after the death of its previous editor-in-chief, Hermann Ludwig Schmid, in 1956, she became editor-in-chief.  Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin.  East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964.  From 1964 until her retirement in 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.\\nAlthough Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position. The reasons for this are unknown, but there could have been some element of discrimination, perhaps due to her gender or politics or both.\\n\\n\\n\\nEine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten., Math.

Kopell received her B.A. from Cornell University in 1963 and her Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1967. She held visiting positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France (1970), MIT (1975, 1976–1977), and the California Institute of Technology (1976).\\nThe focus of her research is the field of applied biomathematics and includes use of mathematical models to analyze the physiological mechanisms of brain dynamics. The techniques Kopell uses include extensions of invariant manifold theory, averaging theory, and geometric methods for singularly perturbed equations. From the peak of her career in 1990, she has contributed to over 200 published research articles in the field of biomathematics. Her current interests include topics such as: how does the brain produce its dynamics (physiological mechanisms), how do brain rhythms take part in cognition (sensory processing, attention, memory, motor control), and how can pathologies of brain dynamics help to understand symptoms of neurological diseases (Parkinson\\'s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy) as well as altered states of consciousness (anesthesia).

She was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, with a fellowship and graduated with an M.A. and a Ph.D. in 1967. At Berkeley, she did well on her exams and was known as the \"bright female.\" However, she struggled in the early stages of her dissertation work and switched supervisors to Stephen Smale. Smale suggested a problem which Kopell almost singlehandedly solved, leading to her thesis in the field of dynamical systems which catapulted her career.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter completing her graduate education, Kopell accepted an instructorship at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she met collaborator Lou Howard, with whom she published several articles.

              " 'Marie-Sophie Germain (French: [maʁi sɔfi ʒɛʁmɛ̃]; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father\\'s library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life. Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred. On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the National Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.\\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain\\'s nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline\\'s son, published some of Germain\\'s work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father\\'s library. Here she found J. E. Montucla\\'s L\\'Histoire des Mathématiques, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.\\nGermain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father\\'s library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d\\'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.\\nGermain\\'s parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the École Polytechnique opened. As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\". The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\". Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc, \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman, and he became her mentor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published Essai sur la théorie des nombres. After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain\\'s work in the Supplément to his second edition of the Théorie des Nombres, where he calls it très ingénieuse (\"very ingenious\"). See also Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem below.\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss\\' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. Le Blanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss\\' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain\\'s work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n = p − 1, where p is a prime number of the form p = 8k + 7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss\\' reply did not comment on Germain\\'s proof.\\nAround 1807 (sources differ), during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss\\' safety.  General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie\\'s name.\\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.  He replied:\\n\\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M. Le Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory\\'s] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\\n\\nGauss\\' letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere. In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x^{n}+y^{n}}\\n  \\n is of the form \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          h\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        n\\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h^{2}+nf^{2}}\\n  \\n, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        +\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x+y}\\n  \\n is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          15\\n          \\n            11\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          8\\n          \\n            11\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 15^{11}+8^{11}}\\n  \\n can be written as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          h\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        11\\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h^{2}+11f^{2}}\\n  \\n, but \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        15\\n        +\\n        8\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 15+8}\\n  \\n cannot.\\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work. Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased. Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain\\'s correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni\\'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange\\'s comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant, and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.\\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research. She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\". Lagrange was able to use Germain\\'s work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".\\n\\n\\n\\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help. Germain\\'s anonymous 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals, and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\". The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson. In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain\\'s help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the academy commission, had had access to her work).\\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"Recherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques\", under her own name, and on 8 January 1816 she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award. Although Germain had at last been awarded the prix extraordinaire, the academy was still not fully satisfied. Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff–Love equation), but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler, which led to incorrect boundary conditions. Here is Germain\\'s final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          N\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          (\\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            2\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          )\\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                ∂\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              z\\n            \\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                t\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        0\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N^{2}\\\\left({\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial x^{4}}}+2{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial x^{2}\\\\partial y^{2}}}+{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{4}z}{\\\\partial y^{4}}}\\\\right)+{\\\\frac {\\\\partial ^{2}z}{\\\\partial t^{2}}}=0,}\\n  \\n\\nwhere N2 is a constant.\\nAfter winning the academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the academy\\'s tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.\\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.\\nOne further work of Germain\\'s on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces\". She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s best work was in number theory, and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. It reawakened Germain\\'s interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.\\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain\\'s letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermat\\'s Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers p that do not divide any of x, y, or z. Case 2 includes all p that divide at least one of x, y, or z. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"Sophie Germain\\'s theorem\":\\n\\nLet p be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime P = 2Np + 1 (N is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\\nif xp + yp + zp ≡ 0 (mod P), then P divides xyz, and\\np is not a p-th power residue (mod P).\\nThen the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem holds true for p.\\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes p < 100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent p < 197\". L. E. Dickson later used Germain\\'s theorem to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.\\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled Remarque sur l\\'impossibilité de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l\\'équation xp + yp = zp, Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat\\'s theorem for p > 5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\", around 40 digits long.  Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre\\'s treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for p = 5 (see Correspondence with Legendre).  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later. Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\", but ultimately her method did not work.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology. She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.\\nTwo of her philosophical works, Pensées diverses and Considérations générales sur l\\'état des sciences et des lettres, aux différentes époques de leur culture, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.  Pensées is a history of science and mathematics with Germain\\'s commentary. In Considérations, the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the humanities.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer.

Mary Gray records: \"She also published in Annales de chimie et de physique an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\" On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.\\nDespite Germain\\'s intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"rentière – annuitant\" (property holder), not a \"mathématicienne\". But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of Göttingen in 1837—six years after Germain\\'s death—Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s resting place in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone.

Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\". Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans\\' 1913 book Woman in Science, although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\". Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".\\nGermain\\'s contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain\\'s work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\" Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"\\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain\\'s theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain\\'s work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\" Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel Tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain\\'s name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower\\'s construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"\\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the Disquisitiones, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\" Gray adds on to say \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\" Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain\\'s creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\", and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches. Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain\\'s biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn\\'s 2001 play Proof. The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden\\'s film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\\nIn the fictional work \"The Last Theorem\" by Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl, Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve Fermat\\'s Last Theorem.\\nA musical about Sophie Germain\\'s life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sophie Germain Prize (French: Prix Sophie Germain), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the Academy of Sciences in Paris.

She earned her Bachelors at City College CUNY in Mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Courant Institute NYU in 1964 under the joint supervision of Lipman Bers and Cathleen Morawetz.  Her thesis concerned partial differential equations of mixed-type.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1964, Lesley Sibner became an instructor at Stanford University for two years. She was a Fulbright Scholar at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris the following year.  At this time, in addition to solo work on the Tricomi equation and compressible flows, she began working with her husband Robert Sibner on a problem suggested by Lipman Bers: do there exists compressible flows on a Riemann surface?  As part of her work in this direction, she studied differential geometry and Hodge theory eventually proving a nonlinear Hodge–DeRham theorem with Robert Sibner based on a physical interpretation of one-dimensional harmonic forms on closed manifolds. The techniques are related to her prior work on compressible flows.  They kept working together on related problems and applications of this important work for many years.\\nIn 1967 she joined the faculty at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York.  In 1969 she proved the Morse index theorem for degenerate elliptic operators by extending classical Sturm–Liouville theory.\\nIn 1971-1972 she spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study where she met Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott. She realized she could use her knowledge of analysis to solve geometric problems related to the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem.  In 1974, \\nLesley and Robert Sibner produced a constructive proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\\nKaren Uhlenbeck suggested that Lesley Sibner work on Yang-Mills equation.  In 1979-1980 she visited Harvard University where she learned gauge field theory from Clifford Taubes. This lead results about point singularities in the Yang-Mills equation and the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations.  Her interest in singularities soon brought her deeper into geometry, leading to a classification of singular connections and to a condition for removing two-dimensional singularities in work with Robert Sibner.\\nRealizing that instantons could under certain circumstances be viewed as monopoles, the Sibners and Uhlenbeck constructed non-minimal unstable critical points of the Yang-Mills functional over the four-sphere in 1989.  She was invited to present this work at the Geometry Festival. She was a Bunting Scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 1991. For the subsequent decades, Lesley Sibner focussed on gauge theory and gravitational instantons.  Although the research sounds very physical, in fact throughout her career, Lesley Sibner applied physical intuition to prove important geometric and topological theorems.\\nIn 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\\n\\n\\n\\nSibner, L.

              " 'Michèle Audin (Algiers, 3 January, 1954) is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the University of Geneva, the University of Paris-Saclay and most recently at the University of Strasbourg, where she performed research notably in the area of symplectic geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichéle Audin is the daughter of mathematician Maurice Audin and mathematics teacher Josette Audin, both pied-noirs and political activists for the independence of Algeria. While she was a child, her father died under torture in June 1957 in Algeria, after being arrested by General Jacques Massu\\'s paratroopers.\\nShe studied at the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles (now merged into the École Normale Supérieure but at the time a separate institution) and then she earned a Ph.D. degree in 1986 from the University of Paris-Saclay, with a thesis written under the supervision of François Latour, entitled Cobordismes d\\'immersions lagrangiennes et legendriens [Cobordisms of Lagrangian and Legendrian immersions].\\nShe then became a professor at the Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) of the Université de Strasbourg from 1987 until her early retirement in 2014. She was president of the association Femmes et mathématiques in 1990 and 1991.\\nIn 2009 she refused to receive the Legion of Honour, on the grounds that the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father. Finally in September 2018, French president Emmanuel Macron admitted that Maurice Audin was tortured to death and apologized on behalf of France.\\nIn 2013 she was awarded the Prix Ève Delacroix for her novel Une vie brève.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichèle Audin\\'s research work mainly belongs to the field of symplectic geometry. Her PhD thesis draws on René Thom\\'s theory of cobordism to contribute to the founding program of symplectic topology launched by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold. Audin then oriented her research to dynamical aspects, and more specifically to Hamiltonian systems.\\nIn her monograph \"Spinning tops: A Course on Integrable Systems\", Audin discusses in detail the question of whether a dynamical system is integrable, a central question of her later research. A particularly enlightening example comes from her article \"Sur la réduction symplectique appliquée à la non-intégrabilité du problème du satellite\".\\nAudin\\'s work on Kovalevskaya top led her to write another book, both mathematical, historical and more personal on this mathematician: \"Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya\". She also published the correspondence (1928-1991) of two members of the Bourbaki group, the mathematicians Henri Cartan and André Weil, she wrote the first biography of the mathematician Jacques Feldbau, and she documented the genesis of the modern holomorphic dynamics, with detailed portraits of the main protagonists: Pierre Fatou, Gaston Julia and Paul Montel.\\nShe contributes regularly on historical subjects to the mathematics popularisation website Images des mathématiques.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlongside her activity as a mathematician, Audin leads an intense literary activity on her own and, since 2009, within the Oulipo.\\n\\n\\n\\nPassionate about the insurrection of the Paris Commune of 1871, Audin has written five books on this topic to document its history as well as its memory: two novels published by Gallimard, Comme une rivière bleue (2017) and Josée Meunier, 19 rue des Juifs (2021), as well as three historical books published by Libertalia. The first, Eugène Varlin, bookbinding worker 1839-1871 (2019), is an anthology of the various writings of Eugène Varlin, some of which have not been published since their original release. The second, C\\'est la nuit surtout que le combat devient furieux (2020), publishes the correspondence between Alix Payen, an unknown paramedic, and her Fourierist family, during the few months of the Parisian insurrection. The last, La Semaine sanglante: Mai 1871. Légendes et comptes (2021), proposes a new counting of the deaths of Bloody Week, going up to “certainly 15,000 dead”.\\n\\n\\n\\nAudin was guest of honor at a meeting of Oulipo on the initiative of Jacques Roubaud, following the publication of her book Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya, which mixes in a discontinuous form anecdotes, precise mathematics, testimonials, excerpts of correspondence with commentary and even literary pastiches. There are references to the Oulipo in testimonial chapters entitled “Je me souviens” in reference to Georges Perec, or even in a pastiche of Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino.\\nShe became part of Oulipo in 2009, as the first member to be both a mathematician and a writer. Mathematics is for her both a source of inspiration for the constraints she invents and a recurring theme in her literary work. For example, in her novel La formule de Stokes, the heroine is a mathematical formula.\\nShe invented constraints of a geometric nature such as Pascal\\'s or Désargues\\' constraint. Pascal\\'s constraint was experienced in her online story Mai Quai Conti which evokes the history of the Académie des sciences during the Paris Commune: the relationships between the characters of the story are determined by the position of the points of a geometric figure illustrating Pascal\\'s theorem.\\nShe also worked with Ian Monk on nonine, i.e. a variant of the sestina based on numbers which are not Queneau numbers, and therefore with which the system of permutation of the sestina does not work.\\nHer first novel, Cent vingt et un jours, is based on an onzine, i.e. a quenine of order 11 (variant of the sestina) from which characters, literary references and other elements of the narrative permute in a regulated manner. As in the poetic sestina, the last word of a chapter is the same as the first word of the next chapter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in French) La formule de Stokes, roman, Cassini, 2016.\\n(in French) Mademoiselle Haas, Gallimard, 2016.\\n(in French) Cent vingt et un jours, Gallimard, 2014.

She was the first woman to be appointed to an Oxford fellowship in mathematics.\\n\\n\\n\\nIda Busbridge born to Percival George Busbridge and May Edith Webb on 10 February 1908.  She was the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was 8 months old of complications from influenza. This left her mother, a primary school teacher, to care for the children.\\nBusbridge started her schooling at 6 in a school in her mother's district.  She moved schools to Christ's Hospital in 1918, having won a scholarship at the age of ten. Here she received a firm grounding in mathematics from Miss Mitchener. Busbridge became head girl of the school and was later described as the most brilliant pupil in its 400-year history.\\nIn 1926 she enrolled in Royal Holloway College, London, intending to specialise in physics, but switched to mathematics in 1928. She turned down a place at Newnham College Cambridge as the scholarship to Royal Holloway was significantly more generous. During her schooling she was involved in the Choral Society and University Choir along with the Science Discussion Society.\\nBusbridge graduated in 1929 with first class honours and was the awarded the Sir John Lubbock Prize for best first class honours of all London University Colleges.  She continued her education at Royal Holloway, earning a masters with distinction in mathematics in 1933.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe began teaching as a demonstrator in mathematics at University College, London in 1933.\\nShe moved to St Hugh's College Oxford in 1935 to teach mathematics alongside Dorothy Wrinch to undergraduates of five women's colleges.  Influenced by Madge Adam and Harry Plaskett, she shifted her interest to applications of maths in astronomy and physics.\\nDuring the Second World War, her workload increased to take on the education of physicists and engineers at Oxford. Her workload was especially great - not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service - but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.  She was appointed to a Fellowship of St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1946 – the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.\\nIn 1962, she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by Oxford. She was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\\nShe was president of the Mathematical Association for 1964.\\nBusbridge's work included integral equations and radiative transfer. She was highly regarded as a lecturer and tutor, attending to her students' educational and personal needs. She retired from Oxford in 1970, and became one of the early tutors and developers of courses at the Open University, teaching Lebesgue integration and tutoring complex analysis.\\nIda Busbridge died on 27 December 1988. A funeral service was held on 9 January 1989 in the church in Keston, where her ashes were later interred, and a memorial service was held at St Hugh's College Oxford on 25 February 1989.

              " \"Helena Rasiowa (20 June 1917 – 9 August 1994) was a Polish mathematician. She worked in the foundations of mathematics and algebraic logic.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa was born in Vienna on 20 June 1917 to Polish parents. As soon as Poland regained its independence in 1918, the family settled in Warsaw. Helena's father was a  railway specialist. She exhibited many different skills and interests, from music to business management and the most important of her interests, mathematics.\\nIn 1938, the time was not very opportune for entering a university. Rasiowa had to interrupt her studies, as no legal education was possible in Poland after 1939. Many people fled the country, or at least they fled the big towns, which were subject to German bombardment and terror. The Rasiowa family fled also, as most high-ranking administration officials and members of the government were being evacuated to Romania. The family spent a year in Lviv. After the Soviet invasion in September 1939, the town was taken over by the Soviet Union. The lives of many Poles became endangered, so Helena's father decided to return to Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa became strongly influenced by Polish logicians. She wrote her Master's thesis under the supervision of Jan Łukasiewicz and Bolesław Sobociński. In 1944, the Warsaw Uprising broke out and consequently Warsaw was almost completely destroyed. This was not only due to the immediate fighting, but also because of the systematic destruction which followed the uprising after it had been suppressed. Rasiowa's thesis burned with the whole house. She herself survived with her mother in a cellar covered by the ruins of the demolished building.\\nAfter the war, Polish mathematics began to recover its institutions, its moods, and its people. Those who remained considered their duty to be the reconstruction of Polish universities and the scientific community. One of the important conditions for this reconstruction was to gather all those who could participate in re-creating mathematics. In the meantime, Rasiowa had accepted a teaching position in a secondary school. That is where she met Andrzej Mostowski and came back to the university. She re-wrote her Master's thesis in 1945 and in the next year she started her academic career as an assistant at the University of Warsaw, the institution she remained linked with for the rest of her life.\\nAt the university, she prepared and defended her PhD thesis, Algebraic Treatment of the Functional Calculi of Lewis and Heyting, in 1950 under the guidance of Prof. Andrzej Mostowski. This thesis on algebraic logic initiated her career contributing to the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic: In 1956, she took her second academic degree, doktor nauk (equivalent to habilitation today) in the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where between 1954 and 1957, she held a post of associate professor, becoming a professor in 1957 and subsequently Full Professor in 1967. For the degree, she submitted two papers, Algebraic Models of Axiomatic Theories and Constructive Theories, which together formed a thesis named Algebraic Models of Elementary Theories and their Applications.\\nRasiowa was pivotal in her role for inviting many international mathematicians, especially logicians, to Poland in the late '70s and early '80s, despite the country's instability at the time. According to Japanese mathematician Hiroakira Ono, she enabled collaboration through her iron will.\\n\\n\\n\\n1963: (with Roman Sikorski) The Mathematics of Metamathematics\\n1974: An Algebraic Approach to Non-Classical Logics\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

              " 'Lisa Marie Piccirillo (born 1990 or 1991) is an American mathematician who works on Geometry and low-dimensional topology. In 2020, Piccirillo published a mathematical proof in the journal Annals of Mathematics determining that the Conway knot is not a slice knot, answering an unsolved problem in knot theory first proposed over fifty years prior by English mathematician John Horton Conway. In July 2020, she became an assistant professor of mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiccirillo was raised in Greenwood, Maine, and attended Telstar Regional High School in Bethel, Maine. Her mother was a middle school math teacher. As a child, she had many hobbies, such as riding dressage, being involved in her church\\'s youth group, and participating in drama and band in school.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiccirillo earned a B.S. in mathematics from Boston College in 2013 and a PhD in low-dimensional topology at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of John Luecke in 2019, followed by postdoctoral research at Brandeis University. Boston College professor Elisenda Grigsby cited Piccirillo\\'s creativity as contributing to her success, adding that Piccirillo did not fit the mold of a \"standard golden child math prodigy\" during her undergraduate studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Conway knot was named after its discoverer, English mathematician John Horton Conway, who first wrote about the knot in 1970. The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however, the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice (whether or not it was a slice of a higher dimensional knot), eluded mathematicians for half a century, making it a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory. This changed with Lisa Piccirillo\\'s work on the Conway knot, which completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified.\\n\\nPiccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry. She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time to \"see what\\'s so hard about this problem\" before finding an answer: I think the next day, which was a Sunday, I just started trying to run the approach for fun and I worked on it a bit in the evenings just to try to see what\\'s supposed to be hard about this problem.Before the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is not “slice”. A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon (mathematician), a professor at UT Austin (a senior topologist), and casually mentioned her solution. In her interview with Quanta Magazine, she described her interaction with Gordon in the following way:And then the following week, I had a meeting with Cameron Gordon, a senior topologist in my department, about something else, and I mentioned it to him there. He was like, \"Oh really? You showed that the Conway knot is not slice?\". Like, show me. And then I started to put it up and he started asking kind of detailed questions, and then at some point he got, he got very excited.Lisa Piccirillo, in the same interview, has mentioned that the fact that this problem was still unsolved was \"completely ridiculous\". As she put it:   Well, I just thought it was completely ridiculous that we didn\\'t know whether this knot was slice or not. We had a lot of tools to do this sort of thing, so I didn\\'t understand like, why for some 11-crossing-knot this would be so difficult. \\nShe followed this statement up with this: It was quite surprising to me. I mean, it\\'s just one knot. In general, when mathematicians prove things, we like to prove really broad, general statements: All objects like this have some property. And I proved like, one knot has a thing. I don\\'t care about knots. So, I do care about three and four dimensional spaces, though. And it turns out that, when you want to study three and four dimensional spaces, you find yourself studying knots anyway.  The Washington Post reported that her proof had been \"hailed as a thing of mathematical beauty, and her work could point to new ways to understand knots.\"\\nFollowing the publication of Piccirillo\\'s proof in Annals of Mathematics, she was offered a tenure-track position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn association with the 2021 Breakthrough Prizes, Piccirillo was awarded one of three 2021 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes, for early-career achievements by a woman mathematician.

This work later had great applicability to the aerodynamics of transonic aircraft, and the Cibrario–Cinquini equation is named for her work from this time.\\nHer later work concerned non-linear differential equations, systems of hyperbolic equations, and the theory of curves and generalized functions. It included the solution of old problems of Édouard Goursat on non-linear hyperbolic equations and of Augustin-Louis Cauchy on systems of first-order equations.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1929, Cibrario won the Corrado Segre prize for her early research, and in 1933, Cibrario won a prize for junior researchers from the Accademia dei Lincei.

              " 'Irmgard Flügge-Lotz, née Lotz (16 July 1903 – 22 May 1974) was a German-American mathematician and aerospace engineer. She was a pioneer in the development of the theory of discontinuous automatic control, which has found wide application in hysteresis control systems; such applications include guidance systems, electronics, fire-control systems, and temperature regulation. She became the first female engineering professor at Stanford University in 1961 and the first female engineer elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\\n\\n\\n\\nLotz was born in Hamelin, Germany on 16 July 1903. She was encouraged at an early age to pursue technical subjects by her mother, whose family had been involved in construction for several generations. She often visited construction sites with her uncle and attended half-price matinee shows for technical films. After her father, Osark, a travelling journalist, was drafted for military service in World War I, the young Irmgard helped the family by becoming a math tutor while studying at a girls\\' Gymnasium in Hanover. Several years later, when Osark returned to Hanover he was in poor health and Irmgard continued to work to bring in extra money for the family. She graduated from the Gymnasium in 1923 and entered the Leibniz University Hannover to study mathematics and engineering. Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:\\n\\nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.\\nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes. In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.\\nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in Göttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe. She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use. She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally. Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.\\nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz\\'s career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics. However, Flügge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\". The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research. Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann Göring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.\\nAt DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems. These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application. She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany. After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d\\'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz\\'s reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.\\nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory. At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers. In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:\\n\\nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.\\nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant. The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag. During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:\\n\\nProfessor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman\\'s intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.\\nShe was also a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a member of Sigma Xi, and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.\\nIn honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award\" was established by the Applied Mechanics Division at Stanford University for outstanding graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz\\'s health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from arthritis that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in Stanford Hospital after a long illness.\\n\\n\\n\\nDie Erwärmung des Stempels beim Stauchvorgang, Dissertation TH Hannover 1929\\nDiscontinuous Automatic Control, Princeton University Press 1953\\nDiscontinuous and Optimal Control, McGraw Hill 1968\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.

              " 'Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian: Софья Васильевна Ковалевская), born Korvin-Krukovskaya (15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1850 – 10 February 1891), was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was \"the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century\".:\\u200a255\\u200a\\nHistorian of mathematics Roger Cooke writes:\\n\\n... the more I reflect on her life and consider the magnitude of her achievements, set against the weight of the obstacles she had to overcome, the more I admire her.  For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\n\\nHer sister was the socialist Anne Jaclard.\\nThere are several alternative transliterations of her name. She herself used Sophie Kowalevski (or occasionally Kowalevsky) in her academic publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (née Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the Imperial Russian Army as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Polibino, his family estate in Pskov Oblast in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian–Polish descent (Polish on his father\\'s side), with possible partial ancestry from the royal Corvin family of Hungary, and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father\\'s side.)\\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor Schubert (1758−1825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya\\'s maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789−1865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father\\'s student days. She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies. Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of A. N. Strannoliubskii. In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.\\nAlthough the word nihilist (нигилист) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (шестидесятники):\\n\\nAfter the famous writer Ivan Turgenev used the word nihilist to refer to Bazarov, the young hero of his 1862 novel Fathers and Children, a certain segment of the \"new people\" adopted that name as well, despite its negative connotations in most quarters.... For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.:\\u200a2–4\\u200a \\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn April 1869, following Sofia\\'s and Vladimir\\'s brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained permission to audit classes with the professors\\' approval at the University of Heidelberg.  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.:\\u200a87–89\\u200a  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to the University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot\\'s Sunday salons. There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot\\'s instigation, on \"woman\\'s capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing Middlemarch at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke\\'s mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\" This was well before Kovalevskaya\\'s notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.:\\u200a104–106\\u200a With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia\\'s and Anyuta\\'s father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, Jaclard was saved.:\\u200a107–108\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn\\'s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.\\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity of local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her sex.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.\\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.\\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden. Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler\\'s sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya\\'s death the two women shared a close friendship.\\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d\\'un corps pesant autour d\\'un point fixe, où l\\'intégration s\\'effectue à l\\'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\". Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"Kovalevskaya top\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is \"completely integrable\" other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.\\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.:\\u200a218\\u200a After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the academy\\'s rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, A Russian Childhood, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, Nihilist Girl (1890).\\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband, but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.:\\u200a18\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya died of epidemic influenza complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.:\\u200a231\\u200a She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s mathematical results, such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz, a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina (translated into English by M. Burov with the title Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R. Cooke.\\n\\n\\n\\nSonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day is a grant-making program of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics. While the AWM currently does not have grant money to support this program, multiple universities continue the program with their own funding.\\nThe Kovalevsky Lecture is sponsored annually by the AWM and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics.\\nThe Kovalevskaia Fund, founded in 1985 with the purpose of supporting women in science in developing countries, was named in her honor.\\nThe lunar crater Kovalevskaya is named in her honor.\\nA gymnasium in Velikiye Luki and a progymnasium in Vilnius are named after Sofya Kovalevskaya.\\nThe Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation of Germany bestows a bi-annual Sofia Kovalevskaya Award to promising young researchers.\\nSaint Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm have streets named in honor of Kovalevskaya.\\nOn 30 June 2021, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 22 or \"Sofya\", COSPAR 2021-059AS) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 constellation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nKovalevskaya has been the subject of three film and TV biographies.\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1956) directed by Iosef Shapiro, starring Yelena Yunger, Lev Kolesov and Tatyana Sezenyevskaya.\\nBerget på månens baksida (\"A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon\") (1983) directed by Lennart Hjulström, starring Gunilla Nyroos as Sofja Kovalewsky and Bibi Andersson as Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, and sister to Gösta Mittag-Leffler.\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1985 TV) directed by Azerbaijani director Ayan Shakhmaliyeva, starring Yelena Safonova as Sofia.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle Sparrow: A Portrait of Sophia Kovalevsky (1983), Don H.

She earned her B.A. in mathematics from Cornell College in Iowa and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Afterwards, she went on to the University of Wisconsin where she was a research assistant in the education department. Due to discrimination against women at the school, she was prevented from pursuing her Ph.D. Instead she earned her Ph.M. in mathematics in 1939.\\n\\n\\n\\nUpon receiving her Ph.M. in mathematics, Livesay worked at Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs where she worked for Princeton Surveys, calculating statistics regarding the costs of state and local governments. She went to Philadelphia where she was trained in the operation and programming of IBM Punch-Card Accounting Machines (PCAMs). She had an assistant and designed plug-board programs for the device for six months. Livesay then received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to study education at the University of Chicago. She worked with Bruno Bettelheim and George Sheviakov on a psychology project.\\nShortly after, in fall 1940, she began assistant teaching at the University of Illinois, where she was promoted to a full-time instructor the following academic year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLivesay was brought onto the Manhattan Project by American physicist Joseph Hirschfelder where he initially reached out to her with the opportunity in the fall of 1943. She began work at Los Alamos in February 1944 after receiving her security clearance. Her advanced mathematics degree and training in programming IBM machines made her uniquely qualified. Upon her arrival, Livesay was asked to work for Richard Feynman's theoretical group, working to determine the predicted shock wave that would result from an implosion type bomb. Livesay held a supervisor role on Feynman's team where she oversaw a crew that ran IBM machines 24 hours a day. She also performed hand calculations to check the work of the IBM machine.\\nAlongside Stan Frankel and Eldred Nelson, Livesay developed a program for the PCAMs to solve the set of hydrodynamic equations for implosions in February and March of 1944. She later served as supervisor of the PCAM operators. Livesay recruited mathematician Eleanor Ewing to the project. While at Los Alamos, they both received mathematics lectures from John von Neumann. Livesay, in turn, instructed von Neumann in the use of the IBM machines, information that he later used in the design of ENIAC.\\nAfter the Manhattan Project, Livesay attempted to continue her career in England. She worked to establish a computer link between Harwell and Teddington. Her salary, 30 percent below that of her colleagues, did not sufficiently offset expense of child care and she abandoned her mathematics career. Beginning in 1956, she taught for a year as an assistant professor of science at Columbia College in South Carolina.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile working at Los Alamos, Livesay met experimental nuclear physicist Anthony French.

              " 'In the mathematical field of graph theory, a semi-symmetric graph is an undirected graph that is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive. In other words, a graph is semi-symmetric if each vertex has the same number of incident edges, and there is a symmetry taking any of the graph\\'s edges to any other of its edges, but there is some pair of vertices such that no symmetry maps the first into the second.\\n\\n\\n\\nA semi-symmetric graph must be bipartite, and its automorphism group must act transitively on each of the two vertex sets of the bipartition (in fact, regularity is not required for this property to hold).  For instance, in the diagram of the Folkman graph shown here, green vertices can not be mapped to red ones by any automorphism, but every two vertices of the same color are symmetric with each other.\\n\\n\\n\\nSemi-symmetric graphs were first studied E. Dauber, a student of F. Harary, in a paper, no longer available, titled \"On line- but not point-symmetric graphs\".  This was seen by Jon Folkman, whose paper, published in 1967, includes the smallest semi-symmetric graph, now known as the Folkman graph, on 20 vertices.\\nThe term \"semi-symmetric\" was first used by Klin et al. in a paper they published in 1978.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe smallest cubic semi-symmetric graph (that is, one in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges) is the Gray graph on 54 vertices.

Paulson began working as a mathematician at JPL in 1948, where she calculated rocket trajectories by hand. She is among the women who made early progress at JPL.\\n\\n\\n\\nBarbara Jean Lewis was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 11, 1928. She was raised with three siblings \\n(two older sisters and one younger brother), and when she was 12 years old her father died. Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well. In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin.\\nIn 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia. In 1975 they finally settled in Glendora.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 as a computer, calculating rocket paths and working on the MGM-5 Corporal, the first guided missile designed by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. Paulson and her colleagues were at one point invited to sign their names on the 100th Corporal rocket prior to its transport to the White Sands test range. The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff. On January 31, 1958, Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper. The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal to carry a warhead over 200 miles.\\nIn 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, she and her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant woman on staff would result in insurance policy problems. JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth. Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who had been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab. Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time. At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'.\\nIn the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars. Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target. In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab.\\n\\nIn the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars. Paulson successfully calculated the trajectory the Viking probe needed on its 11-month transit between Earth and Mars. Paulson's calculations also proved to be essential during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase of the mission in which the lander would detach from the spacecraft, enter the martian atmosphere, and parachute down to the surface. In the late 1970s Paulson and her colleagues worked on some of the first interstellar trajectories during the planning of the Voyager missions in which Voyager 1, having launched in September 1977, and as of April 13, 2019 is the most distant from Earth of all human-made objects.\\nPaulson retired from JPL in 1993 and remained in Pasadena until 2003 before moving to Iowa.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson and her husband Harry had daughters Karen (née Paulson) Bishop and Kathleen (née Paulson) Knutson, four grandchildren (Jonathan, Kyle, Harrison, and Corrine), and several nieces and nephews.  Throughout pregnancy and her eventual return to work at JPL, Barbara's husband at the time was a real estate appraiser and member of the Pasadena Board of Realtors. Fortunately, upon Barbara's return to work Harry was able to adjust his schedule, as did many of the other human computers with children, to ensure that their children were taken care of.\\nBarbara Paulson's husband Harry Murray Paulson died on July 9, 2003, they were married 44 years. In 2003, Paulson sold her home following her husband's death, and moved to Iowa to be closer to her daughters and their families.\\nBarbara Paulson died in Des Moines, Iowa on February 26, 2023, at the age of 94.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1959 Paulson was recognized and received her 10-year pin for her work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

She had four siblings, but they and her father all died by 1900. Cowley's mother, Mary Junkin Buchanan Cowley, later became a member of the Board of Public Education of Pittsburgh, and was the namesake of the Mary J. Cowley School in Pittsburgh. Cowley's grandfather (Mary Cowley's father) was James Galloway Buchanan, a surgeon in the Union Army.\\nCowley earned a bachelor's degree in 1893 from the Indiana State Normal School of Pennsylvania, and became a school teacher. She earned a second bachelor's degree in 1901 and a master's degree in 1902 from Vassar College, and became an instructor at Vassar, studying higher mathematics during the summers at the University of Chicago. In 1908 she completed a doctorate from Columbia University. Her dissertation, on algebraic curves, was supervised by Cassius Jackson Keyser; she became the fourth woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics from Columbia. Continuing to work at Vassar, Cowley was promoted to assistant professor in 1913, and associate professor in 1916. She went on leave in 1926 to assist her mother, and resigned her position at Vassar in 1929, instead becoming a high school teacher in Pittsburgh.\\nShe retired from teaching in 1938, had a stroke in 1941, and died on April 13, 1945, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\\n\\n\\n\\nCowley and her co-author Ida Whiteside won a prize for a 1907 paper they wrote on the orbit of comet C/1825 V1. Another of her publications, in 1926, concerned liquid water pouring puzzles. She was the author of two textbooks on plane and solid geometry, published in 1932 and 1934, and advocated teaching solid geometry to high school students after many colleges had replaced the subject with freshman calculus.

Her doctoral thesis was one of the initial sources of pointless topology. She has also been active in the political left, lost one of her faculty positions over her protests of the Vietnam War, and became  a founder of European Women in Mathematics.\\nMathematician Neil Hindman, with whom Strauss wrote a book on the Stone–Čech compactification of topological semigroups, has stated the following as advice for other mathematicians: \"Find someone who is smarter than you are and get them to put your name on their papers\", writing that for him, that someone was Dona Strauss.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrauss is originally from South Africa, the descendant of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.

By 1972, she was working at the University of Hull and circa 2008 she became a professor at the University of Leeds. After retiring, she has been listed by Leeds as an honorary visiting fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn South Africa, Strauss developed a strong antipathy to racial discrimination from a combination of being a Jew at the time of the Holocaust and her own observations of South African society. At the University of Cape Town, she became a member of the Non-European Unity Movement. After completing her degree, she left the country in protest over apartheid; her parents also left South Africa, after her father\\'s retirement, for Israel. In the 1950s, she regularly published editorial works in Socialist Review, and in the 1960s she was active in Solidarity (UK).\\nAs an assistant professor at Dartmouth College in 1969, Strauss took part in a student anti-war protest that occupied Parkhurst Hall, the building that housed the college administration. In response, Dartmouth announced that Strauss and another faculty protester would not have their contracts renewed, and that they would\\nbe suspended from the faculty and \"denied all rights and privileges of membership on the Dartmouth faculty\", the first time in the college\\'s history that it had taken this step.\\nIn 1986, Strauss became one of the five founders of European Women in Mathematics, together with Bodil Branner, Caroline Series, Gudrun Kalmbach, and Marie-Françoise Roy.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrauss is the co-author of:\\n\\nAlgebra in the Stone-Čech compactification: Theory and applications (with Neil Hindman, De Gruyter Expositions in Mathematics 27, Walter de Gruyter & Co., 1998; 2nd ed., 2012)\\nBanach algebras on semigroups and on their compactifications (with H.

              " 'Beryl May Dent  (10 May 1900 – 9 August 1977) was an English mathematical physicist, technical librarian, and a programmer of early analogue and digital computers to solve electrical engineering problems. She was born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. In 1923, she graduated from the University of Bristol with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\\nShe returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard-Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master\\'s thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.\\nIn 1930, she joined Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company\\'s library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing numerical methods for solving differential equations by the use of the differential analyser that was built for the University of Manchester and Douglas Hartree. She was the first to develop a detailed reduced major axis method for the best fit of a series of data points.\\nLater in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan-Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating semiconducting materials. She joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department. In 1962, she moved with her mother and sister to Sompting, West Sussex, and died there in 1977.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeryl May was born on (1900-05-10)10 May 1900, at Penley Villa, Park Lane, Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of Agnes Dent (1869–1967), née Thornley, and Eustace Edward (1868–1954). She was baptised at St Paul\\'s, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.:\\u200a1\\u200a They had married at St Mary\\'s Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27 July 1898. Her mother was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art. She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers. In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.\\nOn 18 March 1889, Dent\\'s father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board. In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, his elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls\\' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax. In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics\\' Institute. He enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College. In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations. His first teaching post was at Coopers\\' Company Grammar School, Bow, London, before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School.\\nIn October 1901, Dent\\'s father left Chippenham to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster. The family moved to Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century. In April 1907, they moved to 22 Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.:\\u200a264\\u200a He was elected chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922, and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.\\nDent\\'s father was also a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs and the Princess Ju‑Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward. In Princess Ju‑Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the princess, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure. In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night. She also acted in a scene from Tennyson\\'s Princess at the County School\\'s prize giving day on 16 December 1913.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom 1909, Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher. At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne‑Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook. In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the school. In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed. She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916. In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, one of the first two women\\'s colleges in the University of Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1918, Dent joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire. The First World War opened new employment opportunities for women, and RAE was one of the first military establishments to recruit women into engineering, and mathematical and computational research.:\\u200a116\\u200a:\\u200a10\\u200a In the same period that Dent was at RAE, Lorna Swain, then mathematics tutor at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge, worked at the establishment on the problem of aircraft propeller vibration.:\\u200a84\\u200a The Treasury reduced RAE\\'s funding after the end of the war, and consequently, the number of resources and staff available to support research fell significantly.:\\u200a58\\u200a In 1919, she left RAE after being accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol. In June 1920, she passed her intermediate examination in French with supplementary courses in Latin, history, and mathematics.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\nIn the following academic year, Dent joined the honours course in mathematics and took an intermediate examination in physics.:\\u200a1\\u200a After spending the summer of 1921 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course. The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac\\'s previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year. They were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hassé, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge; Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the Bristol University College, soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hassé joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.:\\u200a111\\u200a Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus. Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was \"the best teacher he had ever had.\"\\nDent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\\n\\nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course. Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn June 1923, Dent graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours. On 7 July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge. On her death in 1922, Lilias Sophia Ashworth Hallett left one thousand pounds each to the University of Bristol and Girton College, University of Cambridge, to found scholarships for women.:\\u200a259,\\u200a261\\u200a The University of Bristol scholarship was open to women graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth £45 at the time (equivalent to £3,200 in 2023). She spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification. Before 1948, the University of Cambridge denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as she left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDent spent the summer of 1924 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, playing mixed doubles tennis in a tournament organised by the local Women\\'s Unionist Association. In September of the same year, she was appointed an assistant teacher in mathematics at the High School for Girls, in Barnsley, Huddersfield Road, on an annual salary of £250 (equivalent to £18,000 in 2023). Annie Rose Nuttall, the school\\'s head teacher, was a former student at Newnham College. In the early 1920s, women who had studied university level mathematics faced limited employment prospects, as mathematics and engineering professions, other than perhaps school teaching, were dominated by men. Dent resigned her position on 31 August 1925 after being appointed a demonstrator (research assistant) in the Department of Physics at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).:\\u200a107\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens. From August 1925, John Lennard-Jones, of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, was elected reader in mathematical physics. In March 1927, Lennard‑Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.:\\u200a24\\u200a Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.\\nLennard‑Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals. Dent\\'s thesis for her master\\'s degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard‑Jones, \"Some theoretical determinations of crystal parameters. CXVI\", and with Lennard‑Jones and Sydney Chapman, \"Structure of carbonate crystals\" and \"Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals\". On 28 June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work. In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help. Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\", and with Sydney Chapman, \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage. Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. Lennard‑Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Göttingen. She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: \"The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal\" (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides. In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park, Manchester.:\\u200a14–15\\u200a\\nIn December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the university council. Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1 February 1930. Littleton was later Sir Neville Mott\\'s co-author and research assistant in the physics department.:\\u200a517\\u200a In 1930, Lennard‑Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.\\n\\n\\n\\nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well-known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines, and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer. In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new \"technical intelligence\" section.:\\u200a193\\u200a In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the University of Birmingham, and past member of the first standing committee of ASLIB.:\\u200a228\\u200a Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.:\\u200a193\\u200a In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6 January 1930.:\\u200a15\\u200a She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,:\\u200a314\\u200a and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.:\\u200a193\\u200a\\nDent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.:\\u200a204–205\\u200a In 1932, the branch had twenty-six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.:\\u200a412\\u200a Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.:\\u200a301\\u200a By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan-Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications. Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.\\n\\nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\" (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell. In 1937, David Myers, then at the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Oxford, asked Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter to calculate the space charge limitation of secondary current in a triode.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a96\\u200a The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a differential analyser. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a97\\u200a Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in \"The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines\" (1950). She would later analyse the problem of stress distribution in a thick disk based on a method devised by Philip Pollock, for Richard William Bailey, the former director of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical sections of the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.:\\u200a16\\u200a\\nDent was a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government\\'s conference dinner on 22 September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, she was elected to the editing committee of the ASLIB book list. In 1944, she was put in charge of the women working in the research department laboratory at Metropolitan-Vickers, and in 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the new computation section. Her role would bring her into contact with Audrey Stuckes, a materials science researcher in the department, and a graduate of Newnham College, who would later head the physics department at the University of Salford. In 1953, they collaborated on an investigation into the heating effects that occur when a current is passed through a semiconductor that has no barrier layer. Dent suggested methods to solve the equations and computed the numerical integrations. In the following year, she developed the Fourier analysis in \"Regenerative Deflection as a Parametrically Excited Resonance Phenomenon\" (1954), that calculated the optimal radial oscillations to maintain cyclotron resonance in a synchrocyclotron. The causes of axial spreading of the charged particle beam during extraction were also analysed.\\nDent joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Ferranti Mark 1 (Mark 1) computer at the University of Manchester, that demonstrated that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer. Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services. In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor. A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.\\nIn 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed Zeta circuit on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill\\'s paper on constructing a high-power pulse transformer and circuit. The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds (equivalent to £59,000 in 2023), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time. She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.:\\u200a232\\u200a:\\u200a243\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1920s, Dent was living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton. May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House, and Dent returned to Bristol on 22 December 1934 for Staveley\\'s funeral. Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association, and secretary and treasurer of the group of former Clifton Hill House students.:\\u200a1, 9\\u200a She would later write \"I was very sorry indeed to leave Bristol and have many happy memories of my time there. I shall miss living at the [Clifton Hill House] Hall very much.\":\\u200a15\\u200a\\nIn 1926, Dent was elected treasurer of the University of Bristol\\'s Convocation, the university\\'s alumni association. In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the Convocation:\\u200a62\\u200a She later represented the Manchester branch of the association. Around 1926, Dent was appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association. The association\\'s aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University. In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women\\'s International League in October 1928.\\n\\nIn July 1929, in Dent\\'s last year at Bristol, she went on holiday to North Devon with friends that included Gertrude Roxbee, known as \"Rox\", who had graduated with Dent in 1923 with a BSc in botany.:\\u200a12–13\\u200a After moving to Manchester in January 1930, Dent found shared lodgings at 10 Montrose Avenue, West Didsbury, in the same house as Roxbee who, at that time, was a teacher at Whalley Range High School.:\\u200a15, 50\\u200a At weekends, she would ramble to Hebden Bridge, and with Roxbee, learnt to figure skate at the Ice Palace, a former ice rink on Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.:\\u200a54\\u200a\\nIn September 1930, she returned to Bristol for the ninety-eighth conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (British Association), meeting her friends at an alumnae association lunch.:\\u200a93\\u200a In the afternoon of the 4 September 1930, she toured Avonmouth Docks as a conference member,:\\u200a94\\u200a and in the evening, was invited to a reception held by Walter Bryant, the then lord mayor of Bristol, at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.:\\u200a94\\u200a. On the following day, she visited an aircraft manufacturer at Whitchurch Airport and attended a garden party at Wills Hall.:\\u200a94\\u200a On the Monday of the conference, Dent was in the audience to see Paul Dirac present his paper on the proton and the structure of matter.:\\u200a94\\u200a She would later comment::\\u200a94\\u200a\\n\\nI heard a striking paper by Dirac, who was a student with me, who is now a very famous person, as I always knew he would be ... I now go about boasting that I was in the same class!\\nDent\\'s father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King\\'s Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St Matthew\\'s Church, Stretford.

Lennard‑Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.:\\u200a797\\u200a Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,:\\u200a481\\u200a had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.\\nMichael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in surface and colloid chemistry at Loughborough University of Technology and professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, concurred with Buckley, noting that \"an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal ... is obviously extremely improbable.\" However, they acknowledged that the Lennard‑Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally. Nonetheless, Lennard‑Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.:\\u200a14\\u200a Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and Paul Hansma, has shown that this result has direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.:\\u200a543\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.:\\u200a1\\u200a If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by 𝜆, then the reduced major axis method assumes that 𝜆 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of x and y. RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nIn Dent\\'s 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\", she admitted that when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown, \"we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions.\" However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of Gaussian error functions, she contended that this expression may be regarded as \"a function of the unknown quantities\", or the likelihood function of the data distribution.:\\u200a106\\u200a Furthermore, she argued that maximising this function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation,:\\u200a5\\u200a subject to the condition that the points are collinear, will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the centroid and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.:\\u200a106\\u200a\\nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        θ\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n, satisfies the following quadratic equation:\\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n are the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          X\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          Y\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n vectors in a covariance matrix giving the covariance between each pair of x and y variables.

Furthermore, Albert Madansky, late H. G. B. Alexander professor of business administration at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is negative.:\\u200a201–203\\u200a\\nRichard J. Smith has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in \"A Problem in Least Squares\" (1878) and Charles Kummell in \"Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity\" (1879). It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope, and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.:\\u200a106\\u200a Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.:\\u200a3\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency. On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, \"The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:\\n\\nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the university\\'s library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:\\n\\nThe first problem of calculating the impulse voltage distribution on transformer windings took about five hours of machine time. Conversely, a hand calculation, using a method described by Thomas John Lewis in \"The Transient Behaviour of Ladder Networks of the Type Representing Transformer and Machine Windings\" (1954), took around three months.:\\u200a486\\u200a The use of a computer in the second problem allowed for a more accurate solution as it was possible to include nonlinear magnetic characteristics in the calculation. In the last problem, the torque and speed curves for the synchronous motors were calculated in around fifteen minutes.:\\u200a486\\u200a Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.\\nSignificant research had been devoted to determining a transformer\\'s internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers. It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in \"A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer\" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions\\nand functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.\\nA simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat\\'s principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, which depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.\\nMany important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet\\'s principle. Plateau\\'s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical formulation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations may be said to begin with Newton\\'s minimal resistance problem in 1687, followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli (1696). It immediately occupied the attention of Jacob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l\\'Hôpital, but  Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject, beginning in 1733. Lagrange was influenced by Euler\\'s work to contribute significantly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange, Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange\\'s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his 1756 lecture Elementa Calculi Variationum.\\nLegendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject. To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Poisson (1831), Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The 20th and the 23rd Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further development.\\nIn the 20th century David Hilbert, Oskar Bolza, Gilbert Ames Bliss, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps functions to scalars, so functionals have been described as \"functions of functions.\"  Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n of a given function space defined over a given domain. A functional \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        J\\n        [\\n        y\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is said to have an extremum at the function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        =\\n        J\\n        [\\n        y\\n        ]\\n        −\\n        J\\n        [\\n        f\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n has the same sign for all \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n The function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is called an extremal function or extremal. The extremum \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        J\\n        [\\n        f\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is called a local maximum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≤\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n and a local minimum if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Δ\\n        J\\n        ≥\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.\\nBoth strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the converse may not hold.  Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema. An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler–Lagrange equation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero).  The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equation.\\nConsider the functional\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n

By Noether\\'s theorem, there is an associated conserved quantity. In this case, this quantity is the Hamiltonian, the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, which (often) coincides with the energy of the system. This is (minus) the constant in Beltrami\\'s identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        S\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n depends on higher-derivatives of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n that is, if  then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n must satisfy the Euler–Poisson equation,\\n\\n\\n\\nThe discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives, although the existence of the integral \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        J\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n requires only first derivatives of trial functions. The condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler–Lagrange equation. The theorem of Du Bois-Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form.

Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations in the interior.\\nHowever Lavrentiev in 1926 showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections.

              " 'Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems; it is the study of ergodicity. In this context, \"statistical properties\" refers to properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.\\nErgodic theory, like probability theory, is based on general notions of measure theory.  Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.\\nA central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set. Systems for which the Poincaré recurrence theorem holds are conservative systems; thus all ergodic systems are conservative.\\nMore precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a time average along each trajectory. For the special class of ergodic systems, this time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time \"forgets\" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as mixing and equidistribution, have also been extensively studied.\\nThe problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.\\nThe concepts of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis are central to applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErgodic theory is often concerned with ergodic transformations.  The intuition behind such transformations, which act on a given set, is that they do a thorough job \"stirring\" the elements of that set. E.g. if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout.  At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.\\nThe formal definition is as follows: \\nLet T : X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ), with μ(X) = 1.  Then T is ergodic if for every E in Σ with μ(T−1(E) Δ E) = 0 (that is, E is invariant), either μ(E) = 0 or μ(E) = 1.\\nThe operator Δ here is the symmetric difference of sets, equivalent to the exclusive-or operation with respect to set membership. The condition that the symmetric difference be measure zero is called being essentially invariant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn irrational rotation of the circle R/Z, T: x → x + θ, where θ is irrational, is ergodic. This transformation has even stronger properties of unique ergodicity, minimality, and equidistribution. By contrast, if θ = p/q is rational (in lowest terms) then T is periodic, with period q, and thus cannot be ergodic: for any interval I of length a, 0 < a < 1/q, its orbit under T (that is, the union of I, T(I), ..., Tq−1(I), which contains the image of I under any number of applications of T) is a T-invariant mod 0 set that is a union of q intervals of length a, hence it has measure qa strictly between 0 and 1.\\nLet G be a compact abelian group, μ the normalized Haar measure, and T a group automorphism of G. Let G* be the Pontryagin dual group, consisting of the continuous characters of G, and T* be the corresponding adjoint automorphism of G*. The automorphism T is ergodic if and only if the equality (T*)n(χ) = χ is possible only when n = 0 or χ is the trivial character of G. In particular, if G is the n-dimensional torus and the automorphism T is represented by a unimodular matrix A then T is ergodic if and only if no eigenvalue of A is a root of unity.\\nA Bernoulli shift is ergodic. More generally, ergodicity of the shift transformation associated with a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and some more general stationary processes follows from Kolmogorov\\'s zero–one law.\\nErgodicity of a continuous dynamical system means that its trajectories \"spread around\" the phase space. A system with a compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I functionally independent from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville\\'s theorem implies the existence of a finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is complete integrability.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet T: X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and suppose ƒ is a μ-integrable function, i.e. ƒ ∈ L1(μ). Then we define the following averages:\\n\\n Time average: This is defined as the average (if it exists) over iterations of T starting from some initial point x:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          lim\\n          \\n            n\\n            →\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            k\\n            =\\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n            −\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        f\\n        (\\n        \\n          T\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n        x\\n        )\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\n Space average: If μ(X) is finite and nonzero, we can consider the space or phase average of ƒ:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∫\\n        f\\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        .\\n        \\n        \\n           (For a probability space, \\n        \\n        μ\\n        (\\n        X\\n        )\\n        =\\n        1.\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nIn general the time average and space average may be different. But if the transformation is ergodic, and the measure is invariant, then the time average is equal to the space average almost everywhere. This is the celebrated ergodic theorem, in an abstract form due to George David Birkhoff.  (Actually, Birkhoff\\'s paper considers not the abstract general case but only the case of dynamical systems arising from differential equations on a smooth manifold.) The equidistribution theorem is a special case of the ergodic theorem, dealing specifically with the distribution of probabilities on the unit interval.\\nMore precisely, the pointwise or strong ergodic theorem states that the limit in the definition of the time average of ƒ exists for almost every x and that the (almost everywhere defined) limit function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is integrable:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∈\\n        \\n          L\\n          \\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        μ\\n        )\\n        .\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nFurthermore, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is T-invariant, that is to say\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∘\\n        T\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nholds almost everywhere, and if μ(X) is finite, then the normalization is the same:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        ∫\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        =\\n        ∫\\n        f\\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nIn particular, if T is ergodic, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n must be a constant (almost everywhere), and so one has that\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ¯\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              ^\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nalmost everywhere.

Then the operator\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∫\\n          \\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            T\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          U\\n          \\n            t\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        t\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nconverges in the strong operator topology as T → ∞. In fact, this result also extends to the case of strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of contractive operators on a reflexive space.\\nRemark: Some intuition for the mean ergodic theorem can be developed by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which we think of as U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, it makes sense that the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the  limit just described).\\n\\n\\n\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be as above a probability space with a measure preserving transformation T, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The conditional expectation with respect to the sub-σ-algebra ΣT of the T-invariant sets is a linear projector ET of norm 1 of the Banach space Lp(X, Σ, μ) onto its closed subspace Lp(X, ΣT, μ). The latter may also be characterized as the space of all T-invariant Lp-functions on X. The ergodic means, as linear operators on Lp(X, Σ, μ) also have unit operator norm; and, as a simple consequence of the Birkhoff–Khinchin theorem, converge to the projector ET in the strong operator topology of Lp if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and in the weak operator topology if p = ∞. More is true if 1 < p ≤ ∞ then the Wiener–Yoshida–Kakutani ergodic dominated convergence theorem states that the ergodic means of ƒ ∈ Lp are dominated in Lp; however, if ƒ ∈ L1, the ergodic means may fail to be equidominated in Lp. Finally, if ƒ is assumed to be in the Zygmund class, that is |ƒ| log+(|ƒ|) is integrable, then the ergodic means are even dominated in L1.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space such that μ(X) is finite and nonzero. The time spent in a measurable set A is called the sojourn time.  An immediate consequence of the ergodic theorem is that, in an ergodic system, the relative measure of A is equal to the mean sojourn time:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              A\\n              )\\n            \\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              μ\\n              (\\n              X\\n              )\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        ∫\\n        \\n          χ\\n          \\n            A\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        d\\n        μ\\n        =\\n        \\n          lim\\n          \\n            n\\n            →\\n            ∞\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            k\\n            =\\n            0\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n            −\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          χ\\n          \\n            A\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        \\n          T\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n        x\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nfor all x except for a set of measure zero, where χA is the indicator function of A.\\nThe occurrence times of a measurable set A is defined as the set k1, k2, k3, ..., of times k such that Tk(x) is in A, sorted in increasing order.

The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on SL(2, R) was described in 1952 by S. V. Fomin and I. M. Gelfand. The article on Anosov flows provides an example of ergodic flows on SL(2, R) and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature.  Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the hyperbolic space by the action of a lattice in the semisimple Lie group SO(n,1). Ergodicity of the geodesic flow on Riemannian symmetric spaces was demonstrated by F. I. Mautner in 1957. In 1967 D. V. Anosov and Ya. G. Sinai proved ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative sectional curvature. A simple criterion for the ergodicity of a homogeneous flow on a homogeneous space of a semisimple Lie group was given by Calvin C. Moore in 1966.  Many of the theorems and results from this area of study are typical of rigidity theory.\\nIn the 1930s G. A. Hedlund proved that the horocycle flow on a compact hyperbolic surface is minimal and ergodic. Unique ergodicity of the flow was established by Hillel Furstenberg in 1972. Ratner\\'s theorems provide a major generalization of ergodicity for unipotent flows on the homogeneous spaces of the form Γ \\\\ G, where G is a Lie group and Γ is a lattice in G.\\nIn the last 20 years, there have been many works trying to find a measure-classification theorem similar to Ratner\\'s theorems but for diagonalizable actions, motivated by conjectures of Furstenberg and Margulis. An important partial result (solving those conjectures with an extra assumption of positive entropy) was proved by Elon Lindenstrauss, and he was awarded the Fields medal in 2010 for this result.\\n\\n\\n\\nChaos theory\\nErgodic hypothesis\\nErgodic process\\nKruskal principle\\nLindy effect\\nLyapunov time – the time limit to the predictability of the system\\nMaximal ergodic theorem\\nOrnstein isomorphism theorem\\nStatistical mechanics\\nSymbolic dynamics\\n\\n\\n',\n",

              " 'Erika Pannwitz (May 26, 1904 in Hohenlychen, Germany – November 25, 1975 in Berlin) was a German mathematician who worked in the area of geometric topology. During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office (German: Auswärtiges Amt) colloquially known as Pers Z S. After the war, she became editor-in-chief of Zentralblatt MATH.\\n\\n\\n\\nErika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor School in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922.  She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and Göttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt. Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\\n\\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem posed to her through completely independent investigations; she has achieved this goal through the appropriate choice of new terms, through understanding and deep insight into the difficult material presented to her, through the mastery of older methods and their novel use, and has thus demonstrated her scientific maturity in this, her first dissertation.\\nSince, in my opinion, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective achievement in it exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the work submitted by Miss Pannwitz as a dissertation with the rating \"eximium\".\\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\\n\\nI certainly agree with Mr Hopf\\'s vote. Topology is one of the most promising but at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still in its infancy, so that any valuable result can only be achieved with a high degree of strong inventiveness. Through the present work, topology has been enriched by a series of extraordinarily beautiful theorems\\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.  The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik. This was due to the difficulty of women achieving an academic career in the 1930\\'s, who found their career path blocked into higher education. It was also due to Pannwitz along with many other German mathematicians not wanting to provide support to the Nazis, despite her excellent dissertion. From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort.  After Germany\\'s defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt für Mathematik, and after the death of its previous editor-in-chief, Hermann Ludwig Schmid, in 1956, she became editor-in-chief.  Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin.  East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964.  From 1964 until her retirement in 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.\\nAlthough Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position. The reasons for this are unknown, but there could have been some element of discrimination, perhaps due to her gender or politics or both.\\n\\n\\n\\nEine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten., Math.

              " 'Nancy Jane Kopell (born November 8, 1942, New York City) is an American mathematician and professor at Boston University. She is co-director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet). She organized and directs the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC). Kopell received her B.A. from Cornell University in 1963 and her Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1967. She held visiting positions at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France (1970), MIT (1975, 1976–1977), and the California Institute of Technology (1976).\\nThe focus of her research is the field of applied biomathematics and includes use of mathematical models to analyze the physiological mechanisms of brain dynamics. The techniques Kopell uses include extensions of invariant manifold theory, averaging theory, and geometric methods for singularly perturbed equations. From the peak of her career in 1990, she has contributed to over 200 published research articles in the field of biomathematics. Her current interests include topics such as: how does the brain produce its dynamics (physiological mechanisms), how do brain rhythms take part in cognition (sensory processing, attention, memory, motor control), and how can pathologies of brain dynamics help to understand symptoms of neurological diseases (Parkinson\\'s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy) as well as altered states of consciousness (anesthesia). She collaborates widely with experimentalists and clinicians in order to conduct research on these topics.\\nKopell is a 1990 MacArthur Fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKopell was born on November 8, 1942, and grew up on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. Her father was an accountant and her mother and older sister also majored in mathematics.\\nAs a child, she had a severe eye problem which taught her how to cope with being \"different.\" This ability to cope would help her successfully deal with feelings of marginalization she would later experience as a female scientist. She attributes her professional success to this ability as well as the support she received from mentors throughout her career. Her high school teachers encouraged her to go into the mathematics field.\\nDuring her undergraduate education at Cornell University, she registered for a mathematics honors program, and was the only female participant. Kopell graduated from Cornell with an A.B. in 1963.\\nShe then decided to attend graduate school in order to \"find an alternative to the more traditional life her family expected for her.\" Kopell originally applied to programs on the East Coast and was admitted to all of them except for one; however, after being encouraged by another student, she chose to attend school on the West Coast instead. She was admitted to the University of California, Berkeley, with a fellowship and graduated with an M.A. and a Ph.D. in 1967. At Berkeley, she did well on her exams and was known as the \"bright female.\" However, she struggled in the early stages of her dissertation work and switched supervisors to Stephen Smale. Smale suggested a problem which Kopell almost singlehandedly solved, leading to her thesis in the field of dynamical systems which catapulted her career.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter completing her graduate education, Kopell accepted an instructorship at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she met collaborator Lou Howard, with whom she published several articles. She later met her husband, Gabriel Stolzenberg, at Northeastern University.\\nWhile Kopell did her thesis work in theoretical mathematics, she later switched to applied mathematics.\\nIn 1969, she joined Northeastern University as faculty, becoming a full professor in 1978. In 1986, she became a professor of mathematics at Boston University and in 2009 she became the first woman at Boston University to be named a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor. She was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1990 for her work developing methods of dynamical systems to attack problems of applied mathematics. She is currently Director and Co-Founder of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, which consists of a group of over two dozen labs, mostly in the Boston Area, working on brain dynamics and their cognitive implications. She is also Co-Director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet).\\nKopell is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was recently selected to be an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society, a distinction given to one or two mathematicians per year worldwide. She has been awarded Sloan Guggenheim, and McArthur Fellowships, and has an honorary Ph.D. from the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

              " 'Marie-Sophie Germain (French: [maʁi sɔfi ʒɛʁmɛ̃]; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father\\'s library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life. Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred. On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the National Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.\\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain\\'s nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline\\'s son, published some of Germain\\'s work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father\\'s library. Here she found J. E. Montucla\\'s L\\'Histoire des Mathématiques, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.\\nGermain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father\\'s library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d\\'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.\\nGermain\\'s parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the École Polytechnique opened. As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\". The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\". Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc, \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman, and he became her mentor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published Essai sur la théorie des nombres. After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain\\'s work in the Supplément to his second edition of the Théorie des Nombres, where he calls it très ingénieuse (\"very ingenious\"). See also Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem below.\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss\\' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. Le Blanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss\\' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain\\'s work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n = p − 1, where p is a prime number of the form p = 8k + 7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss\\' reply did not comment on Germain\\'s proof.\\nAround 1807 (sources differ), during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss\\' safety.  General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie\\'s name.\\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.  He replied:\\n\\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M. Le Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory\\'s] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\\n\\nGauss\\' letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere. In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is of the form \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          h\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        n\\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        +\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          15\\n          \\n            11\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          8\\n          \\n            11\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n can be written as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          h\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        11\\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n, but \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        15\\n        +\\n        8\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n cannot.\\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work. Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased. Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain\\'s correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni\\'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange\\'s comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant, and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.\\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research. She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\". Lagrange was able to use Germain\\'s work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".\\n\\n\\n\\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help. Germain\\'s anonymous 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals, and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\". The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson. In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain\\'s help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the academy commission, had had access to her work).\\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"Recherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques\", under her own name, and on 8 January 1816 she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award. Although Germain had at last been awarded the prix extraordinaire, the academy was still not fully satisfied. Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff–Love equation), but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler, which led to incorrect boundary conditions. Here is Germain\\'s final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          N\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          (\\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            2\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    x\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      2\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            +\\n            \\n              \\n                \\n                  \\n                    ∂\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                  z\\n                \\n                \\n                  ∂\\n                  \\n                    y\\n                    \\n                      4\\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n          )\\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                ∂\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n              z\\n            \\n            \\n              ∂\\n              \\n                t\\n                \\n                  2\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        0\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\nwhere N2 is a constant.\\nAfter winning the academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the academy\\'s tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.\\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.\\nOne further work of Germain\\'s on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces\". She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s best work was in number theory, and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. It reawakened Germain\\'s interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.\\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain\\'s letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermat\\'s Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers p that do not divide any of x, y, or z. Case 2 includes all p that divide at least one of x, y, or z. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"Sophie Germain\\'s theorem\":\\n\\nLet p be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime P = 2Np + 1 (N is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\\nif xp + yp + zp ≡ 0 (mod P), then P divides xyz, and\\np is not a p-th power residue (mod P).\\nThen the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem holds true for p.\\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes p < 100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent p < 197\". L. E. Dickson later used Germain\\'s theorem to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.\\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled Remarque sur l\\'impossibilité de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l\\'équation xp + yp = zp, Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat\\'s theorem for p > 5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\", around 40 digits long.  Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre\\'s treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for p = 5 (see Correspondence with Legendre).  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later. Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\", but ultimately her method did not work.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology. She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.\\nTwo of her philosophical works, Pensées diverses and Considérations générales sur l\\'état des sciences et des lettres, aux différentes époques de leur culture, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.  Pensées is a history of science and mathematics with Germain\\'s commentary. In Considérations, the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the humanities.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain, she continued to work. In 1831 Crelle\\'s Journal published her paper on the curvature of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding y and z in \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                4\\n                (\\n                \\n                  x\\n                  \\n                    p\\n                  \\n                \\n                −\\n                1\\n                )\\n              \\n              \\n                x\\n                −\\n                1\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          y\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n        ±\\n        p\\n        \\n          z\\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\". Mary Gray records: \"She also published in Annales de chimie et de physique an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\" On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.\\nDespite Germain\\'s intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"rentière – annuitant\" (property holder), not a \"mathématicienne\". But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of Göttingen in 1837—six years after Germain\\'s death—Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s resting place in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone.  At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.\\nIn January 2020, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Sophie Germain.\\n\\n\\n\\nE.

Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\". Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans\\' 1913 book Woman in Science, although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\". Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".\\nGermain\\'s contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain\\'s work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\" Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"\\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain\\'s theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain\\'s work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\" Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel Tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain\\'s name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower\\'s construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"\\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the Disquisitiones, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\" Gray adds on to say \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\" Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain\\'s creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\", and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches. Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain\\'s biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn\\'s 2001 play Proof. The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden\\'s film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\\nIn the fictional work \"The Last Theorem\" by Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl, Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve Fermat\\'s Last Theorem.\\nA musical about Sophie Germain\\'s life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sophie Germain Prize (French: Prix Sophie Germain), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the Academy of Sciences in Paris.

              " 'Lesley Millman Sibner (August 13, 1934 – September 11, 2013)  was an American mathematician and professor of mathematics at Polytechnic Institute of New York University. She earned her Bachelors at City College CUNY in Mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Courant Institute NYU in 1964 under the joint supervision of Lipman Bers and Cathleen Morawetz.  Her thesis concerned partial differential equations of mixed-type.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1964, Lesley Sibner became an instructor at Stanford University for two years. She was a Fulbright Scholar at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris the following year.  At this time, in addition to solo work on the Tricomi equation and compressible flows, she began working with her husband Robert Sibner on a problem suggested by Lipman Bers: do there exists compressible flows on a Riemann surface?  As part of her work in this direction, she studied differential geometry and Hodge theory eventually proving a nonlinear Hodge–DeRham theorem with Robert Sibner based on a physical interpretation of one-dimensional harmonic forms on closed manifolds. The techniques are related to her prior work on compressible flows.  They kept working together on related problems and applications of this important work for many years.\\nIn 1967 she joined the faculty at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York.  In 1969 she proved the Morse index theorem for degenerate elliptic operators by extending classical Sturm–Liouville theory.\\nIn 1971-1972 she spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study where she met Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott. She realized she could use her knowledge of analysis to solve geometric problems related to the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem.  In 1974, \\nLesley and Robert Sibner produced a constructive proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\\nKaren Uhlenbeck suggested that Lesley Sibner work on Yang-Mills equation.  In 1979-1980 she visited Harvard University where she learned gauge field theory from Clifford Taubes. This lead results about point singularities in the Yang-Mills equation and the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations.  Her interest in singularities soon brought her deeper into geometry, leading to a classification of singular connections and to a condition for removing two-dimensional singularities in work with Robert Sibner.\\nRealizing that instantons could under certain circumstances be viewed as monopoles, the Sibners and Uhlenbeck constructed non-minimal unstable critical points of the Yang-Mills functional over the four-sphere in 1989.  She was invited to present this work at the Geometry Festival. She was a Bunting Scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 1991. For the subsequent decades, Lesley Sibner focussed on gauge theory and gravitational instantons.  Although the research sounds very physical, in fact throughout her career, Lesley Sibner applied physical intuition to prove important geometric and topological theorems.\\nIn 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\\n\\n\\n\\nSibner, L.

              " 'Michèle Audin (Algiers, 3 January, 1954) is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the University of Geneva, the University of Paris-Saclay and most recently at the University of Strasbourg, where she performed research notably in the area of symplectic geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichéle Audin is the daughter of mathematician Maurice Audin and mathematics teacher Josette Audin, both pied-noirs and political activists for the independence of Algeria. While she was a child, her father died under torture in June 1957 in Algeria, after being arrested by General Jacques Massu\\'s paratroopers.\\nShe studied at the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles (now merged into the École Normale Supérieure but at the time a separate institution) and then she earned a Ph.D. degree in 1986 from the University of Paris-Saclay, with a thesis written under the supervision of François Latour, entitled Cobordismes d\\'immersions lagrangiennes et legendriens [Cobordisms of Lagrangian and Legendrian immersions].\\nShe then became a professor at the Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) of the Université de Strasbourg from 1987 until her early retirement in 2014. She was president of the association Femmes et mathématiques in 1990 and 1991.\\nIn 2009 she refused to receive the Legion of Honour, on the grounds that the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father. Finally in September 2018, French president Emmanuel Macron admitted that Maurice Audin was tortured to death and apologized on behalf of France.\\nIn 2013 she was awarded the Prix Ève Delacroix for her novel Une vie brève.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichèle Audin\\'s research work mainly belongs to the field of symplectic geometry. Her PhD thesis draws on René Thom\\'s theory of cobordism to contribute to the founding program of symplectic topology launched by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold. Audin then oriented her research to dynamical aspects, and more specifically to Hamiltonian systems.\\nIn her monograph \"Spinning tops: A Course on Integrable Systems\", Audin discusses in detail the question of whether a dynamical system is integrable, a central question of her later research. A particularly enlightening example comes from her article \"Sur la réduction symplectique appliquée à la non-intégrabilité du problème du satellite\".\\nAudin\\'s work on Kovalevskaya top led her to write another book, both mathematical, historical and more personal on this mathematician: \"Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya\". She also published the correspondence (1928-1991) of two members of the Bourbaki group, the mathematicians Henri Cartan and André Weil, she wrote the first biography of the mathematician Jacques Feldbau, and she documented the genesis of the modern holomorphic dynamics, with detailed portraits of the main protagonists: Pierre Fatou, Gaston Julia and Paul Montel.\\nShe contributes regularly on historical subjects to the mathematics popularisation website Images des mathématiques.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlongside her activity as a mathematician, Audin leads an intense literary activity on her own and, since 2009, within the Oulipo.\\n\\n\\n\\nPassionate about the insurrection of the Paris Commune of 1871, Audin has written five books on this topic to document its history as well as its memory: two novels published by Gallimard, Comme une rivière bleue (2017) and Josée Meunier, 19 rue des Juifs (2021), as well as three historical books published by Libertalia. The first, Eugène Varlin, bookbinding worker 1839-1871 (2019), is an anthology of the various writings of Eugène Varlin, some of which have not been published since their original release. The second, C\\'est la nuit surtout que le combat devient furieux (2020), publishes the correspondence between Alix Payen, an unknown paramedic, and her Fourierist family, during the few months of the Parisian insurrection. The last, La Semaine sanglante: Mai 1871. Légendes et comptes (2021), proposes a new counting of the deaths of Bloody Week, going up to “certainly 15,000 dead”.\\n\\n\\n\\nAudin was guest of honor at a meeting of Oulipo on the initiative of Jacques Roubaud, following the publication of her book Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya, which mixes in a discontinuous form anecdotes, precise mathematics, testimonials, excerpts of correspondence with commentary and even literary pastiches. There are references to the Oulipo in testimonial chapters entitled “Je me souviens” in reference to Georges Perec, or even in a pastiche of Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino.\\nShe became part of Oulipo in 2009, as the first member to be both a mathematician and a writer. Mathematics is for her both a source of inspiration for the constraints she invents and a recurring theme in her literary work. For example, in her novel La formule de Stokes, the heroine is a mathematical formula.\\nShe invented constraints of a geometric nature such as Pascal\\'s or Désargues\\' constraint. Pascal\\'s constraint was experienced in her online story Mai Quai Conti which evokes the history of the Académie des sciences during the Paris Commune: the relationships between the characters of the story are determined by the position of the points of a geometric figure illustrating Pascal\\'s theorem.\\nShe also worked with Ian Monk on nonine, i.e. a variant of the sestina based on numbers which are not Queneau numbers, and therefore with which the system of permutation of the sestina does not work.\\nHer first novel, Cent vingt et un jours, is based on an onzine, i.e. a quenine of order 11 (variant of the sestina) from which characters, literary references and other elements of the narrative permute in a regulated manner. As in the poetic sestina, the last word of a chapter is the same as the first word of the next chapter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in French) La formule de Stokes, roman, Cassini, 2016.\\n(in French) Mademoiselle Haas, Gallimard, 2016.\\n(in French) Cent vingt et un jours, Gallimard, 2014.

She was the first woman to be appointed to an Oxford fellowship in mathematics.\\n\\n\\n\\nIda Busbridge born to Percival George Busbridge and May Edith Webb on 10 February 1908.  She was the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was 8 months old of complications from influenza. This left her mother, a primary school teacher, to care for the children.\\nBusbridge started her schooling at 6 in a school in her mother's district.  She moved schools to Christ's Hospital in 1918, having won a scholarship at the age of ten. Here she received a firm grounding in mathematics from Miss Mitchener. Busbridge became head girl of the school and was later described as the most brilliant pupil in its 400-year history.\\nIn 1926 she enrolled in Royal Holloway College, London, intending to specialise in physics, but switched to mathematics in 1928. She turned down a place at Newnham College Cambridge as the scholarship to Royal Holloway was significantly more generous. During her schooling she was involved in the Choral Society and University Choir along with the Science Discussion Society.\\nBusbridge graduated in 1929 with first class honours and was the awarded the Sir John Lubbock Prize for best first class honours of all London University Colleges.

Influenced by Madge Adam and Harry Plaskett, she shifted her interest to applications of maths in astronomy and physics.\\nDuring the Second World War, her workload increased to take on the education of physicists and engineers at Oxford. Her workload was especially great - not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service - but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.  She was appointed to a Fellowship of St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1946 – the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.\\nIn 1962, she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by Oxford. She was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\\nShe was president of the Mathematical Association for 1964.\\nBusbridge's work included integral equations and radiative transfer.

              " \"Helena Rasiowa (20 June 1917 – 9 August 1994) was a Polish mathematician. She worked in the foundations of mathematics and algebraic logic.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa was born in Vienna on 20 June 1917 to Polish parents. As soon as Poland regained its independence in 1918, the family settled in Warsaw. Helena's father was a  railway specialist. She exhibited many different skills and interests, from music to business management and the most important of her interests, mathematics.\\nIn 1938, the time was not very opportune for entering a university. Rasiowa had to interrupt her studies, as no legal education was possible in Poland after 1939. Many people fled the country, or at least they fled the big towns, which were subject to German bombardment and terror. The Rasiowa family fled also, as most high-ranking administration officials and members of the government were being evacuated to Romania. The family spent a year in Lviv. After the Soviet invasion in September 1939, the town was taken over by the Soviet Union. The lives of many Poles became endangered, so Helena's father decided to return to Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa became strongly influenced by Polish logicians. She wrote her Master's thesis under the supervision of Jan Łukasiewicz and Bolesław Sobociński. In 1944, the Warsaw Uprising broke out and consequently Warsaw was almost completely destroyed. This was not only due to the immediate fighting, but also because of the systematic destruction which followed the uprising after it had been suppressed. Rasiowa's thesis burned with the whole house. She herself survived with her mother in a cellar covered by the ruins of the demolished building.\\nAfter the war, Polish mathematics began to recover its institutions, its moods, and its people. Those who remained considered their duty to be the reconstruction of Polish universities and the scientific community. One of the important conditions for this reconstruction was to gather all those who could participate in re-creating mathematics. In the meantime, Rasiowa had accepted a teaching position in a secondary school. That is where she met Andrzej Mostowski and came back to the university. She re-wrote her Master's thesis in 1945 and in the next year she started her academic career as an assistant at the University of Warsaw, the institution she remained linked with for the rest of her life.\\nAt the university, she prepared and defended her PhD thesis, Algebraic Treatment of the Functional Calculi of Lewis and Heyting, in 1950 under the guidance of Prof. Andrzej Mostowski. This thesis on algebraic logic initiated her career contributing to the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic: In 1956, she took her second academic degree, doktor nauk (equivalent to habilitation today) in the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where between 1954 and 1957, she held a post of associate professor, becoming a professor in 1957 and subsequently Full Professor in 1967. For the degree, she submitted two papers, Algebraic Models of Axiomatic Theories and Constructive Theories, which together formed a thesis named Algebraic Models of Elementary Theories and their Applications.\\nRasiowa was pivotal in her role for inviting many international mathematicians, especially logicians, to Poland in the late '70s and early '80s, despite the country's instability at the time. According to Japanese mathematician Hiroakira Ono, she enabled collaboration through her iron will.\\n\\n\\n\\n1963: (with Roman Sikorski) The Mathematics of Metamathematics\\n1974: An Algebraic Approach to Non-Classical Logics\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Boston College professor Elisenda Grigsby cited Piccirillo\\'s creativity as contributing to her success, adding that Piccirillo did not fit the mold of a \"standard golden child math prodigy\" during her undergraduate studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Conway knot was named after its discoverer, English mathematician John Horton Conway, who first wrote about the knot in 1970. The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however, the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice (whether or not it was a slice of a higher dimensional knot), eluded mathematicians for half a century, making it a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory. This changed with Lisa Piccirillo\\'s work on the Conway knot, which completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified.\\n\\nPiccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry. She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time to \"see what\\'s so hard about this problem\" before finding an answer: I think the next day, which was a Sunday, I just started trying to run the approach for fun and I worked on it a bit in the evenings just to try to see what\\'s supposed to be hard about this problem.Before the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is not “slice”. A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon (mathematician), a professor at UT Austin (a senior topologist), and casually mentioned her solution. In her interview with Quanta Magazine, she described her interaction with Gordon in the following way:And then the following week, I had a meeting with Cameron Gordon, a senior topologist in my department, about something else, and I mentioned it to him there. He was like, \"Oh really? You showed that the Conway knot is not slice?\". Like, show me. And then I started to put it up and he started asking kind of detailed questions, and then at some point he got, he got very excited.Lisa Piccirillo, in the same interview, has mentioned that the fact that this problem was still unsolved was \"completely ridiculous\". As she put it:   Well, I just thought it was completely ridiculous that we didn\\'t know whether this knot was slice or not. We had a lot of tools to do this sort of thing, so I didn\\'t understand like, why for some 11-crossing-knot this would be so difficult. \\nShe followed this statement up with this: It was quite surprising to me. I mean, it\\'s just one knot. In general, when mathematicians prove things, we like to prove really broad, general statements: All objects like this have some property. And I proved like, one knot has a thing. I don\\'t care about knots. So, I do care about three and four dimensional spaces, though. And it turns out that, when you want to study three and four dimensional spaces, you find yourself studying knots anyway.  The Washington Post reported that her proof had been \"hailed as a thing of mathematical beauty, and her work could point to new ways to understand knots.\"\\nFollowing the publication of Piccirillo\\'s proof in Annals of Mathematics, she was offered a tenure-track position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn association with the 2021 Breakthrough Prizes, Piccirillo was awarded one of three 2021 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes, for early-career achievements by a woman mathematician. The other two winners were Nina Holden and Urmila Mahadev. She was also awarded a 2021 Clay Research Fellowship for \"her work in low-dimensional topology\" and a 2021 Sloan Research Fellowship.\\nShe was also counted as one of \"The world\\'s top 50 thinkers for the Covid-19 age\" by UK magazine Prospect.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Later in life, she explained why she decided to study engineering:\\n\\nI wanted a life which would never be boring. That meant a life in which always new things would occur ... I wanted a career in which I would always be happy even if I were to remain unmarried.\\nIn college she studied applied mathematics and fluid dynamics and was often the only woman in her classes. In 1927, she received her Diplom-Ingenieur and remained in Hanover for her doctorate. In 1929 she earned her doctorate in engineering, publishing her thesis on the mathematical theory of circular cylinders and heat conduction.\\nLotz went to work for the Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt (AVA) in Göttingen, one of the most prominent aeronautical research institutions in Europe. She joined as a junior research engineer and worked closely with Ludwig Prandtl and Albert Betz, two of the leading German aerodynamicists of the time. Prior to her arrival at the AVA, Prandtl had been unsuccessfully working on solving a differential equation for his lifting-line theory for the spanwise lift distribution of an airplane wing. Lotz was able to overcome his difficulties and solve the equation, and additionally developed a relatively simple method for practical use. She published what is now known as the \"Lotz method\" in 1931 for calculating the lift on a three-dimensional wing, and it became a standard technique used internationally. Following this achievement, she was promoted to team leader and built the theoretical department at the AVA by establishing her own research program and assisting other research groups.\\nIn 1932, she met Wilhelm Flügge, who was a civil engineer and privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. As they prepared to marry, Lotz\\'s career progressed well and by the time they married in 1938 she had been appointed Head of the Department of Theoretical Aerodynamics. However, Flügge was branded \"politically unreliable\" and denied promotion at Göttingen for his anti-Nazi views. Flügge later recalled that while he was denied because of his political views, Lotz was \"blocked from any possibility of ever getting into a university career, just because of being a woman\". The escalation and increasing influence of Nazi policies on academia led to their departure from the AVA and they moved to the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt (DVL) in Berlin where Flügge-Lotz (her married name) was a consultant in aerodynamics and flight dynamics and Flügge was appointed Chief of Structures Research. Although banned from academic positions due to Nazi policies, they were permitted to continue their research activities under the protection of Hermann Göring, who was more concerned with technical expertise than ideological purity.\\nAt DVL Flügge-Lotz began her career in automatic control theory and pioneered the theory of discontinuous control systems. These control systems, also known as \"on-off\" and \"bang-bang\" systems, have only two or three input settings and are simple to manufacture and very reliable in practical application. She was mainly interested in the implications these systems had for the development of simple automatic flight control equipment. However, the theory describing their performance needed to be developed before they could be reliably implemented in physical systems. Flügge-Lotz began developing the theory while at DVL, but wartime priorities limited her time for heavily theoretical projects so she focused mainly on aerodynamics during this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs World War II progressed, Berlin was increasingly subject to bombing raids by the Allies. In the spring of 1944, the destruction of Berlin had progressed so far that Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with their departments to the small town Saulgau in the hills of southern Germany. After the end of the war, Saulgau was in the French zone of Allied-occupied Germany. The French relaunched their aeronautical research activity and were eager to hire German scientists, so in 1947 Flügge-Lotz and Flügge moved with many of their colleagues to Paris to join the Office National d\\'Etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA). Flügge-Lotz served as Chief of a research group in aerodynamics until 1948 and published papers in both automatic control theory and aerodynamics, in which she discussed the problems arising from the increased speed of aircraft.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Flügge-Lotz and her husband were happy living in Paris, the positions they held there provided limited opportunity for advancement. They wrote to Stephen Timoshenko at Stanford University casually asking about working in the United States and in 1948, and both received offers to teach there. However, at the time Stanford held a university policy that husband and wife could not hold professional rank in the same department, and despite Flügge-Lotz\\'s reputation in research, she had to accept the relatively minor position of \"lecturer\" as her husband became professor.\\nDespite lacking of a professorial title, she immediately began accepting students for PhD dissertation research in aerodynamic theory, and in the spring of 1949, taught her first Stanford course in boundary layer theory. At Stanford, Flügge-Lotz conducted research in numerical methods to solve boundary layer problems in fluid dynamics, making pioneering contributions with finite difference methods and the use of computers. In 1951 she set up a weekly fluid mechanics seminar for first-year graduate students to provide a forum for discussing the latest ideas and developments.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to fluid mechanics, Flügge-Lotz returned to her work on automatic control theory initially started at DVL. She developed new courses and began advising student theses on the subject. She published the first textbook on discontinuous automatic control in 1953. A reviewer of her textbook wrote that:\\n\\nIn the simplest case a discontinuous automatic control system is a control system in which the correcting force is a positive constant A, or the corresponding negative constant -A, depending upon whether the sign of the error is positive or negative. Because of their simplicity, such systems are widely used, and the literature contains discussions of many particular systems of this kind. The present book represents the first attempt to treat such systems in a comprehensive and general way. ... the book constitutes a highly valuable contribution to the subject of automatic control, and it will, undoubtedly, lead to many further advances in the field.\\nSince automatic control devices often found application in electronics, she also began collaborating with faculty and students in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Over time, her primary research efforts went increasingly into control theory, and in 1968, the year of her retirement, she published her second book, Discontinuous and Optimal Control.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the mid-1950s, it became evident that Flügge-Lotz was performing all the duties of a full Professor but without official recognition. In fact, it was hard for students to understand why she was a Lecturer rather than a Professor, or even what the difference meant. The disparity of her status as a Lecturer became more apparent when she was the only female delegate from the United States at the first Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control in Moscow. To address the issue before school opened for the fall quarter, she was appointed a full Professor in both Engineering Mechanics and in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 1961.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz retired in 1968 at age 65, but continued to conduct research on satellite control systems, heat transfer, and high-speed vehicle drag. During her lifetime, she received many honors for her work. In 1970, she was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and chosen to give the von Kármán lecture to the AIAA in 1971. She received the Achievement Award by the Society of Women Engineers in 1970, and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Maryland in 1973. The citation for her honorary degree stated:\\n\\nProfessor Flügge-Lotz has acted in a central role in the development of the aircraft industry in the Western world. Her contributions have spanned a lifetime during which she demonstrate, in a field dominated by men, the value and quality of a woman\\'s intuitive approach in searching for and discovering solutions to complex engineering problems. Her work manifests unusual personal dedication and native intelligence.\\nShe was also a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a member of Sigma Xi, and a member of the advisory boards of several scientific journals.\\nIn honor of her contributions, the “Wilhelm Flügge and Irmgard Flügge-Lotz Memorial Award\" was established by the Applied Mechanics Division at Stanford University for outstanding graduate students.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlügge-Lotz\\'s health deteriorated after her retirement and she suffered increasingly severe pain from arthritis that spread over her body. On May 22, 1974, Flügge-Lotz died in Stanford Hospital after a long illness.\\n\\n\\n\\nDie Erwärmung des Stempels beim Stauchvorgang, Dissertation TH Hannover 1929\\nDiscontinuous Automatic Control, Princeton University Press 1953\\nDiscontinuous and Optimal Control, McGraw Hill 1968\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.

              " 'Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian: Софья Васильевна Ковалевская), born Korvin-Krukovskaya (15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1850 – 10 February 1891), was a Russian mathematician who made noteworthy contributions to analysis, partial differential equations and mechanics. She was a pioneer for women in mathematics around the world – the first woman to obtain a doctorate (in the modern sense) in mathematics, the first woman appointed to a full professorship in northern Europe and one of the first women to work for a scientific journal as an editor. According to historian of science Ann Hibner Koblitz, Kovalevskaya was \"the greatest known woman scientist before the twentieth century\".:\\u200a255\\u200a\\nHistorian of mathematics Roger Cooke writes:\\n\\n... the more I reflect on her life and consider the magnitude of her achievements, set against the weight of the obstacles she had to overcome, the more I admire her.  For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination. To achieve, as she did, at least two major results of lasting value to scholarship, is evidence of a considerable talent, developed through iron discipline.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\n\\nHer sister was the socialist Anne Jaclard.\\nThere are several alternative transliterations of her name. She herself used Sophie Kowalevski (or occasionally Kowalevsky) in her academic publications.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (née Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the Imperial Russian Army as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Polibino, his family estate in Pskov Oblast in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian–Polish descent (Polish on his father\\'s side), with possible partial ancestry from the royal Corvin family of Hungary, and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some Romani ancestry on the father\\'s side.)\\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great-grandfather was the astronomer and geographer Friedrich Theodor Schubert (1758−1825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya\\'s maternal grandfather, was General Theodor Friedrich von Schubert (1789−1865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. When she was 11 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by Ostrogradsky, left over from her father\\'s student days. She was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual aptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions which she had not yet encountered in her studies. Tyrtov called her a \"new Pascal\" and suggested she be given a chance to pursue further studies under the tutelage of A. N. Strannoliubskii. In 1866-67 she spent much of the winter with her family in St. Petersburg, where she was provided private tutoring by Strannoliubskii, a well-known advocate of higher education for women, who taught her calculus. During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her sister Anna to progressive ideas influenced by the radical movement of the 1860s, providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing Russian nihilism.\\nAlthough the word nihilist (нигилист) often was used in a negative sense, it did not have that meaning for the young Russians of the 1860s (шестидесятники):\\n\\nAfter the famous writer Ivan Turgenev used the word nihilist to refer to Bazarov, the young hero of his 1862 novel Fathers and Children, a certain segment of the \"new people\" adopted that name as well, despite its negative connotations in most quarters.... For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.:\\u200a2–4\\u200a \\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with Vladimir Kovalevskij, a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of Charles Darwin in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn April 1869, following Sofia\\'s and Vladimir\\'s brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained permission to audit classes with the professors\\' approval at the University of Heidelberg.  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen.:\\u200a87–89\\u200a  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to the University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin, while she was invited to attend George Eliot\\'s Sunday salons. There, at age nineteen, she met Herbert Spencer and was led into a debate, at Eliot\\'s instigation, on \"woman\\'s capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing Middlemarch at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke\\'s mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\" This was well before Kovalevskaya\\'s notable contribution of the \"Kovalevskaya top\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with Karl Weierstrass, since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed with her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the Paris Commune, where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.:\\u200a104–106\\u200a With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband Victor Jaclard, who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia\\'s and Anyuta\\'s father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, Jaclard was saved.:\\u200a107–108\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers—on partial differential equations, on the dynamics of Saturn\\'s rings, and on elliptic integrals—to the University of Göttingen as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics summa cum laude, after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.\\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate (in the modern sense of the word) in mathematics. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the Cauchy–Kovalevskaya theorem, which proves the existence and analyticity of local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her sex.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.\\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.\\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, whom she had known as a fellow student of Weierstrass, Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a privat-docent at Stockholm University in Sweden. Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler\\'s sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler. Until Kovalevskaya\\'s death the two women shared a close friendship.\\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of Acta Mathematica. In 1888 she won the Prix Bordin of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"Mémoire sur un cas particulier du problème de la rotation d\\'un corps pesant autour d\\'un point fixe, où l\\'intégration s\\'effectue à l\\'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\". Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"Kovalevskaya top\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of rigid body motion that is \"completely integrable\" other than the tops of Euler and Lagrange.\\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.:\\u200a218\\u200a After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the academy\\'s rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the progressive political and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, A Russian Childhood, two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, Nihilist Girl (1890).\\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with Maxim Kovalevsky, a distant relation of her deceased husband, but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.:\\u200a18\\u200a\\nKovalevskaya died of epidemic influenza complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.:\\u200a231\\u200a She is buried in Solna, Sweden, at Norra begravningsplatsen.\\nKovalevskaya\\'s mathematical results, such as the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem, and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz, a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina (translated into English by M. Burov with the title Love and Mathematics: Sofya Kovalevskaya, Mir Publishers, 1985), and a book about her mathematics by R. Cooke.\\n\\n\\n\\nSonya Kovalevsky High School Mathematics Day is a grant-making program of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), funding workshops across the United States which encourage girls to explore mathematics. While the AWM currently does not have grant money to support this program, multiple universities continue the program with their own funding.\\nThe Kovalevsky Lecture is sponsored annually by the AWM and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and is intended to highlight significant contributions of women in the fields of applied or computational mathematics.\\nThe Kovalevskaia Fund, founded in 1985 with the purpose of supporting women in science in developing countries, was named in her honor.\\nThe lunar crater Kovalevskaya is named in her honor.\\nA gymnasium in Velikiye Luki and a progymnasium in Vilnius are named after Sofya Kovalevskaya.\\nThe Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation of Germany bestows a bi-annual Sofia Kovalevskaya Award to promising young researchers.\\nSaint Petersburg, Moscow, and Stockholm have streets named in honor of Kovalevskaya.\\nOn 30 June 2021, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 22 or \"Sofya\", COSPAR 2021-059AS) was launched into space as part of the Satellogic Aleph-1 constellation.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nKovalevskaya has been the subject of three film and TV biographies.\\n\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1956) directed by Iosef Shapiro, starring Yelena Yunger, Lev Kolesov and Tatyana Sezenyevskaya.\\nBerget på månens baksida (\"A Hill on the Dark Side of the Moon\") (1983) directed by Lennart Hjulström, starring Gunilla Nyroos as Sofja Kovalewsky and Bibi Andersson as Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler, Duchess of Cajanello, and sister to Gösta Mittag-Leffler.\\nSofya Kovalevskaya (1985 TV) directed by Azerbaijani director Ayan Shakhmaliyeva, starring Yelena Safonova as Sofia.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle Sparrow: A Portrait of Sophia Kovalevsky (1983), Don H.

She had a varied career as a teacher and an administrator of mathematical organizations, culminating in the position of Executive Director of the Mathematical Association of America. After retirement she started a new career in environmental education, specializing in children\\'s programs such as GreenKids.\\n\\n\\n\\nSward was born Marcia Ruth Peterson in Maywood, Illinois on February 1, 1939.\\nShe received a bachelor\\'s degree from Vassar College in 1961. She received a master\\'s degree in 1963 and a PhD in mathematics in 1967 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her PhD thesis was written under Edward J. Scott and titled The Mixed Boundary Value Problem Along the Line of Parabolicity for a Certain Class of Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations.\\nSward died in Washington, D.C., on September 21, 2008.\\n\\n\\n\\nSward was unable to get an academic job immediately after receiving her PhD, and worked as a housemother at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. She then received an appointment at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., and worked there from 1968 to 1980 and was department head from 1979 to 1980.\\nSward then switched in mid-career from academic to nonprofit organization executive. She stated in an interview with Association Management magazine that one reason was a low threshold of boredom, but also emphasized the need to stretch one\\'s skills. She said, \"As a professor I really didn\\'t manage anything. The focus was on the intellectual work. So when I switched to association management, I had to learn how to manage programs, delegate, work with committees, raise money, work with budgets.\"\\nHer first executive position was as the first Associate Executive Director of the Mathematical Association of America. Among the duties of the newly created position were directing the organization\\'s three journals and creating a newsletter that turned out to be MAA Focus. Sward became the newsletter\\'s first editor and held that position for the remainder of her time as Associate Executive Director.\\nShe left the MAA in September 1985 to become the first Executive Director of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board of the United States National Research Council, then returned in 1989 as Executive Director of the MAA upon the retirement of Alfred B. Willcox. During this time she helped create many new programs, for example Project NExT, for which she persuaded ExxonMobil to provide funding. She worked with Ed Dubinsky to develop Special Interest Groups inside MAA. She received the Citation for Public Service from the Council of the American Mathematical Society in 1992.\\nIn 1999 Sward retired from the Executive Director position and spent a year sailing in The Bahamas. She switched careers again to work with the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation as senior director for education and environment and then in 2004 became Deputy Executive Director of the Audubon Naturalist Society of the Central Atlantic States. She led their Environmental Education department until her death in 2008. During her time there she worked to get the ANS Nature Preschool started, began the GreenKids program (an outreach program that sends naturalists to Montgomery County, Maryland, schools), and helped start the Loudoun Environmental Stewardship Alliance. She was influenced by Richard Louv\\'s book Last Child in the Woods to work on projects that made a difference in the lives of children.\\n\\n\\n\\nJon W. Scott; Tina H. Straley; Marcia P.

Paulson began working as a mathematician at JPL in 1948, where she calculated rocket trajectories by hand. She is among the women who made early progress at JPL.\\n\\n\\n\\nBarbara Jean Lewis was born in Columbus, Ohio on April 11, 1928. She was raised with three siblings \\n(two older sisters and one younger brother), and when she was 12 years old her father died. Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well. In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin.\\nIn 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia. In 1975 they finally settled in Glendora.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1948 as a computer, calculating rocket paths and working on the MGM-5 Corporal, the first guided missile designed by the United States to carry a nuclear warhead. Paulson and her colleagues were at one point invited to sign their names on the 100th Corporal rocket prior to its transport to the White Sands test range. The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff. On January 31, 1958, Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union. Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper. The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal to carry a warhead over 200 miles.\\nIn 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, she and her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant woman on staff would result in insurance policy problems. JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth. Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who had been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab. Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time. At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'.\\nIn the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars. Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target. In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab.\\n\\nIn the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars. Paulson successfully calculated the trajectory the Viking probe needed on its 11-month transit between Earth and Mars. Paulson's calculations also proved to be essential during the entry, descent, and landing (EDL) phase of the mission in which the lander would detach from the spacecraft, enter the martian atmosphere, and parachute down to the surface. In the late 1970s Paulson and her colleagues worked on some of the first interstellar trajectories during the planning of the Voyager missions in which Voyager 1, having launched in September 1977, and as of April 13, 2019 is the most distant from Earth of all human-made objects.\\nPaulson retired from JPL in 1993 and remained in Pasadena until 2003 before moving to Iowa.\\n\\n\\n\\nPaulson and her husband Harry had daughters Karen (née Paulson) Bishop and Kathleen (née Paulson) Knutson, four grandchildren (Jonathan, Kyle, Harrison, and Corrine), and several nieces and nephews.  Throughout pregnancy and her eventual return to work at JPL, Barbara's husband at the time was a real estate appraiser and member of the Pasadena Board of Realtors. Fortunately, upon Barbara's return to work Harry was able to adjust his schedule, as did many of the other human computers with children, to ensure that their children were taken care of.\\nBarbara Paulson's husband Harry Murray Paulson died on July 9, 2003, they were married 44 years. In 2003, Paulson sold her home following her husband's death, and moved to Iowa to be closer to her daughters and their families.\\nBarbara Paulson died in Des Moines, Iowa on February 26, 2023, at the age of 94.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1959 Paulson was recognized and received her 10-year pin for her work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Paulson would work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for 45 years, and retire in 1993. In 2016, Nathalia Holt wrote Rise of the Rocket Girls, a book about Paulson and other women who were early employees at NASA.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

She was born in Chippenham, Wiltshire, the eldest daughter of schoolteachers. The family left Chippenham in 1901, after her father became head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School. In 1923, she graduated from the University of Bristol with First Class Honours in applied mathematics. She was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the university and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College, Cambridge.\\nShe returned to Bristol in 1925, after being appointed a researcher in the Physics Department at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1927, John Lennard-Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics. Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and she became one of his first collaborators. They published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, that were to become the foundation of her master\\'s thesis. Later work has shown that the results they obtained had direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.\\nIn 1930, she joined Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd, Manchester, as a technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff of the research department. She became active in the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB) and was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the Lancashire and Cheshire branch of the association. She served on various ASLIB committees and made conference presentations detailing different aspects of the company\\'s library and information service. She continued to publish scientific papers, contributing numerical methods for solving differential equations by the use of the differential analyser that was built for the University of Manchester and Douglas Hartree. She was the first to develop a detailed reduced major axis method for the best fit of a series of data points.\\nLater in her career she became leader of the computation section at Metropolitan-Vickers, and then a supervisor in the research department for the section that was investigating semiconducting materials. She joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. She retired in 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.

She was baptised at St Paul\\'s, Chippenham, on 8 June 1900.:\\u200a1\\u200a They had married at St Mary\\'s Church, Goosnargh, near Preston, Lancashire, on 27 July 1898. Her mother was educated at the Harris Institute, Preston, passing examinations in science and art. She was a teacher at Attercliffe School, in northeast Sheffield, before moving to Goosnargh School, near her hometown of Preston, where her elder brother and sister, John William and Mary Ann Thornley, were the head teachers. In March 1894, she had applied for the headship at Fairfield School, Cockermouth, making the shortlist, but the board decided to appoint a local candidate.\\nOn 18 March 1889, Dent\\'s father was appointed to a teaching assistant position at Portland Road School, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, after completing a teaching apprenticeship with the school board. In the same year, Florence Emily Dent, his elder sister, was appointed head teacher at West Vale girls\\' school, Stainland Road, Greetland, moving from the Higher Board School at Halifax. In August 1889, he obtained a first class pass in mathematics from the Halifax Mechanics\\' Institute. He enrolled on a degree course at University College, Aberystwyth, in the Education Day Training College. In January 1894, he was awarded a first by Aberystwyth, and a first in the external University of London examinations. His first teaching post was at Coopers\\' Company Grammar School, Bow, London, before moving to Chippenham, where he was a senior assistant teacher at the Chippenham County School.\\nIn October 1901, Dent\\'s father left Chippenham to become head teacher of the then recently established Warminster County School, that adjoined the Athenaeum Theatre in Warminster. The family moved to Boreham Road, Warminster, where houses were built in the early 19th century. In April 1907, they moved to 22 Portway, Warminster, situated a short distance from the County School and the Athenaeum.:\\u200a264\\u200a He was elected chair of the Warminster Urban District Council from 1920 to 1922, and remained as head teacher of the County School until his retirement in August 1929.\\nDent\\'s father was also a regular cast member of the Warminster Operatic Society at the Athenaeum and other venues. Dent and her younger sister, Florence Mary, would often appear with him on stage in such operettas as Snow White and the seven dwarfs and the Princess Ju‑Ju (The Golden Amulet), a Japanese operetta in three acts by Clementine Ward. In Princess Ju‑Ju, she played La La, one of the three maidens attendant on the princess, and sang the first act solo, She must be demure. In act two of the same musical, she performed in the fan dance, Spirits of the Night. She also acted in a scene from Tennyson\\'s Princess at the County School\\'s prize giving day on 16 December 1913.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom 1909, Dent was educated at Warminster County School, where her father was head teacher. At school, she was close friends with her neighbour at Portway, Evelyn Mary Day, the eldest daughter of Henry George Day, a former butler to Colonel Charles Gathorne Gathorne‑Hardy, son of Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook. In August 1914, she passed the University of Oxford Junior Local Examination with First Class Honours, and on the strength of her examination result, she was awarded a scholarship by the school. In 1915, she passed the senior examination with second class honours and a distinction in French, and subsequently, her scholarship was renewed. She then joined the sixth form and won the school prize for French in December 1916. In March 1918, she applied for a scholarship in mathematics from Somerville College, one of the first two women\\'s colleges in the University of Oxford. She was highly commended but was not awarded a scholarship nor an exhibition.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1918, Dent joined the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire. The First World War opened new employment opportunities for women, and RAE was one of the first military establishments to recruit women into engineering, and mathematical and computational research.:\\u200a116\\u200a:\\u200a10\\u200a In the same period that Dent was at RAE, Lorna Swain, then mathematics tutor at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge, worked at the establishment on the problem of aircraft propeller vibration.:\\u200a84\\u200a The Treasury reduced RAE\\'s funding after the end of the war, and consequently, the number of resources and staff available to support research fell significantly.:\\u200a58\\u200a In 1919, she left RAE after being accepted on to the general Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree course at the University of Bristol. In June 1920, she passed her intermediate examination in French with supplementary courses in Latin, history, and mathematics.:\\u200a1\\u200a\\nIn the following academic year, Dent joined the honours course in mathematics and took an intermediate examination in physics.:\\u200a1\\u200a After spending the summer of 1921 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, she returned for the start of the 1921 to 1922 academic year to find that Paul Dirac had joined the mathematics course. The course of mathematics at Bristol University normally lasted three years, but because of Dirac\\'s previous training, the Department of Mathematics had allowed him to join in the second year. They were taught applied mathematics by Henry Ronald Hassé, the then head of the Mathematics Department, and pure mathematics by Peter Fraser. Both of them had come from Cambridge; Fraser had been appointed in 1906 to the staff of the Bristol University College, soon to become the University of Bristol, and Hassé joined him in 1919 as professor of mathematics.:\\u200a111\\u200a Fraser introduced them to mathematical rigour, projective geometry, and rigorous proofs in differential and integral calculus. Dirac would later say that Peter Fraser was \"the best teacher he had ever had.\"\\nDent studied four courses in pure mathematics:\\n\\nThere was a choice of specialisation in the final year; applied or pure mathematics. As the only official, registered fee-paying student, Dent had the right to choose, and she settled on applied mathematics for the final year. The department could offer only one set of lectures so Dirac also had to follow the same course. Dent studied four courses in applied mathematics:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn June 1923, Dent graduated with Dirac, gaining a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in applied mathematics with First Class Honours. On 7 July 1923, she was awarded the Ashworth Hallett scholarship by the University of Bristol and was accepted as a postgraduate student at Newnham College in the University of Cambridge. On her death in 1922, Lilias Sophia Ashworth Hallett left one thousand pounds each to the University of Bristol and Girton College, University of Cambridge, to found scholarships for women.:\\u200a259,\\u200a261\\u200a The University of Bristol scholarship was open to women graduates of a recognised college or university, and worth £45 at the time (equivalent to £3,200 in 2023). She spent a year at Cambridge, leaving in 1924 without further academic qualification. Before 1948, the University of Cambridge denied women graduates a degree, although in the same year as she left Cambridge, Katharine Margaret Wilson was the first woman to be awarded a PhD by the university.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDent spent the summer of 1924 at her parents\\' home in Warminster, playing mixed doubles tennis in a tournament organised by the local Women\\'s Unionist Association. In September of the same year, she was appointed an assistant teacher in mathematics at the High School for Girls, in Barnsley, Huddersfield Road, on an annual salary of £250 (equivalent to £18,000 in 2023). Annie Rose Nuttall, the school\\'s head teacher, was a former student at Newnham College. In the early 1920s, women who had studied university level mathematics faced limited employment prospects, as mathematics and engineering professions, other than perhaps school teaching, were dominated by men. Dent resigned her position on 31 August 1925 after being appointed a demonstrator (research assistant) in the Department of Physics at the University of Bristol, with her salary being paid by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the forerunner of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC).:\\u200a107\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1924, the University of Bristol Council had set aside a portion of a bequest from Henry Herbert Wills for the Department of Physics where Arthur Mannering Tyndall was building up a staff for teaching and research in the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory, Royal Fort House Gardens. From August 1925, John Lennard-Jones, of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, was elected reader in mathematical physics. In March 1927, Lennard‑Jones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.:\\u200a24\\u200a Lennard‑Jones pioneered the theory of interatomic and intermolecular forces at Bristol and Dent became one of his first collaborators.\\nLennard‑Jones and Dent published six papers together from 1926 to 1928, dealing with the forces between atoms and ions, with the objective of calculating theoretically the properties of carbonate and nitrate crystals. Dent\\'s thesis for her master\\'s degree, Some theoretical determinations of crystal structure (1927), was the basis of the three papers that followed in 1927; with Lennard‑Jones, \"Some theoretical determinations of crystal parameters. CXVI\", and with Lennard‑Jones and Sydney Chapman, \"Structure of carbonate crystals\" and \"Part II. Structure of carbonate crystals\". On 28 June 1927, she was awarded a MSc degree for her thesis and research work. In 1927, the physics laboratory at Bristol had a surplus of funds, and so it was decided that the funds would be used to provide more technical help. Consequently, Dent was asked to combine her research duties with the post of part-time departmental librarian, the first appointment of librarian in the Department of Physics.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\", and with Sydney Chapman, \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that studied the force fields on a thin crystal cleavage. Around this time, quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. Lennard‑Jones left Bristol in 1929 to study the subject for a year as a Rockefeller Fellow at the University of Göttingen. She wrote one last paper before leaving the physics department at Bristol: \"The effect of boundary distortion on the surface energy of a crystal\" (1929) examined the effect of the polarisation of surface ions in decreasing the surface energy of alkali halides. In November 1929, she was appointed to the position of technical librarian for the scientific and technical staff in the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park, Manchester.:\\u200a14–15\\u200a\\nIn December 1929, Dent resigned her position at Bristol and it was accepted with regret by the university council. Marjorie Josephine Littleton, the daughter of a local Bristol councillor and a graduate of Girton College, University of Cambridge, was appointed as her replacement on the 1 February 1930. Littleton was later Sir Neville Mott\\'s co-author and research assistant in the physics department.:\\u200a517\\u200a In 1930, Lennard‑Jones returned to Bristol, as Dean of the Faculty of Science, and introduced the new quantum theories to the Bristol group.\\n\\n\\n\\nMetropolitan-Vickers was a British heavy industrial firm, well-known for industrial electrical equipment and generators, street lighting, electronics, steam turbines, and diesel locomotives. They built the Metrovick 950, the first commercial transistorised computer. In 1917, a Research and Education Department was established at the Trafford Park site, when the care of the library came within the remit of James George Pearce. He made the library the centre of a new \"technical intelligence\" section.:\\u200a193\\u200a In the 1920s, the post of librarian was held by Lucy Stubbs, a former assistant librarian at the University of Birmingham, and past member of the first standing committee of ASLIB.:\\u200a228\\u200a Stubbs did not possess scientific qualifications, maintaining that a librarian, if assisted by other technical staff, did not need to understand science or engineering.:\\u200a193\\u200a In 1929, James Steele Park Paton reorganised and expanded the section with Dent succeeding Stubbs as technical librarian on 6 January 1930.:\\u200a15\\u200a She joined the scientific and technical staff as was one of only two senior women in the research department,:\\u200a314\\u200a and in contrast to Stubbs, was employed principally for her technical skills.:\\u200a193\\u200a\\nDent was honorary secretary to the founding committee for the ASLIB Lancashire and Cheshire branch from 1931 to 1936.:\\u200a204–205\\u200a In 1932, the branch had twenty-six members and had organised four meetings, including one addressed by Sir Henry Tizard, the then President of ASLIB. After the war, it formed the basis for the Northern Branch of the association.:\\u200a412\\u200a Technical librarianship emerged as a new scientific career in interwar Britain and rapidly became one of the few types of professional industrial employment that was routinely open to both women and men.:\\u200a301\\u200a By 1933, Dent reported that the Metropolitan-Vickers library had three thousand engineering volumes and around the same number in pamphlets and patent specifications. Besides covering electrical subjects, the library covered accountancy, employment questions, and subjects of interest to the sales department. It also issued a weekly bulletin, scrutinised patents, handled patents taken out by research staff, and exchanged information with associated companies.\\n\\nDent continued to publish papers in applied mathematics and contribute to papers on emerging computational technologies. In \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\" (1935), she developed a detailed reduced major axis method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock and Charles Kummell. In 1937, David Myers, then at the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Oxford, asked Douglas Hartree and Arthur Porter to calculate the space charge limitation of secondary current in a triode.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a96\\u200a The calculations relied on some initial numerical integrations that were carried out by Dent on a differential analyser. The results corresponded closely to those obtained experimentally by Myers at Oxford.:\\u200a91\\u200a:\\u200a97\\u200a Her knowledge of higher mathematics meant that she was asked to check the mathematics in papers for publication by engineers at Metropolitan-Vickers. For example, Cyril Frederick Gradwell, a graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, asked her to scrutinise the algebraic part of his work in \"The Solution of a problem in disk bending occurring in connexion with gas turbines\" (1950). She would later analyse the problem of stress distribution in a thick disk based on a method devised by Philip Pollock, for Richard William Bailey, the former director of the mechanical, metallurgical, and chemical sections of the research department at Metropolitan-Vickers.:\\u200a16\\u200a\\nDent was a delegate at the fourteenth International Conference on Documentation and was invited to the Government\\'s conference dinner on 22 September 1938 at the Great Dining Hall of Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, she was elected to the editing committee of the ASLIB book list. In 1944, she was put in charge of the women working in the research department laboratory at Metropolitan-Vickers, and in 1946, she was promoted to section leader of the new computation section. Her role would bring her into contact with Audrey Stuckes, a materials science researcher in the department, and a graduate of Newnham College, who would later head the physics department at the University of Salford. In 1953, they collaborated on an investigation into the heating effects that occur when a current is passed through a semiconductor that has no barrier layer. Dent suggested methods to solve the equations and computed the numerical integrations. In the following year, she developed the Fourier analysis in \"Regenerative Deflection as a Parametrically Excited Resonance Phenomenon\" (1954), that calculated the optimal radial oscillations to maintain cyclotron resonance in a synchrocyclotron. The causes of axial spreading of the charged particle beam during extraction were also analysed.\\nDent joined the Women\\'s Engineering Society and published papers on the application of digital computers to electrical design. With Brian Birtwistle, she wrote programs for the Ferranti Mark 1 (Mark 1) computer at the University of Manchester, that demonstrated that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer. Birtwistle would later have an extensive career in the computer industry, working at, amongst others, Honeywell Information Systems and ADP Network Services. In 1958, she carried out computer calculations for the mechanical engineering team at the Nuclear Power Group, Radbroke Hall. Their paper outlined a procedure for calculating the theoretical deflection (bending) of a circular grid of support girders for a graphite neutron moderator in a gas-cooled reactor. A general expression was derived from the central deflection of the grid and the maximum bending moment on the central cross-beam for a range of grid diameters.\\nIn 1959, and a year from retirement, Dent modelled a proposed Zeta circuit on the Mark 1 computer, for Eric Hartill\\'s paper on constructing a high-power pulse transformer and circuit. The cost of the computation was about two thousand pounds (equivalent to £59,000 in 2023), corresponding to around eighty hours of machine time. She retired from Metropolitan-Vickers in May 1960, with Isabel Hardwich, later a fellow and president of the Women\\'s Engineering Society, replacing her as section leader for the women in the research department.:\\u200a232\\u200a:\\u200a243\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1920s, Dent was living at Clifton Hill House, the university hall of residence for women in Clifton. May Christophera Staveley was her warden and tutor at Clifton Hill House, and Dent returned to Bristol on 22 December 1934 for Staveley\\'s funeral. Dent was a member of the Clifton Hill House Old Students Association, and secretary and treasurer of the group of former Clifton Hill House students.:\\u200a1, 9\\u200a She would later write \"I was very sorry indeed to leave Bristol and have many happy memories of my time there. I shall miss living at the [Clifton Hill House] Hall very much.\":\\u200a15\\u200a\\nIn 1926, Dent was elected treasurer of the University of Bristol\\'s Convocation, the university\\'s alumni association. In 1927, she was one of eleven people elected to the standing committee of the Convocation:\\u200a62\\u200a She later represented the Manchester branch of the association. Around 1926, Dent was appointed honorary secretary of the Bristol Cheeloo Association. The association\\'s aim was to raise sufficient funds to support a chair of chemistry at Cheeloo University. In an effort to publicise the cause and raise money, she presented to the local branch of the Women\\'s International League in October 1928.\\n\\nIn July 1929, in Dent\\'s last year at Bristol, she went on holiday to North Devon with friends that included Gertrude Roxbee, known as \"Rox\", who had graduated with Dent in 1923 with a BSc in botany.:\\u200a12–13\\u200a After moving to Manchester in January 1930, Dent found shared lodgings at 10 Montrose Avenue, West Didsbury, in the same house as Roxbee who, at that time, was a teacher at Whalley Range High School.:\\u200a15, 50\\u200a At weekends, she would ramble to Hebden Bridge, and with Roxbee, learnt to figure skate at the Ice Palace, a former ice rink on Derby Street in Cheetham Hill.:\\u200a54\\u200a\\nIn September 1930, she returned to Bristol for the ninety-eighth conference of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (British Association), meeting her friends at an alumnae association lunch.:\\u200a93\\u200a In the afternoon of the 4 September 1930, she toured Avonmouth Docks as a conference member,:\\u200a94\\u200a and in the evening, was invited to a reception held by Walter Bryant, the then lord mayor of Bristol, at the Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.:\\u200a94\\u200a. On the following day, she visited an aircraft manufacturer at Whitchurch Airport and attended a garden party at Wills Hall.:\\u200a94\\u200a On the Monday of the conference, Dent was in the audience to see Paul Dirac present his paper on the proton and the structure of matter.:\\u200a94\\u200a She would later comment::\\u200a94\\u200a\\n\\nI heard a striking paper by Dirac, who was a student with me, who is now a very famous person, as I always knew he would be ... I now go about boasting that I was in the same class!\\nDent\\'s father died on (1954-06-24)24 June 1954, at their shared home, 529 King\\'s Road, Stretford, with the funeral service taking place at St Matthew\\'s Church, Stretford. She had close links to St Matthew\\'s; from 1956 to 1962, she served as a school manager for St Matthew\\'s Church of England Primary School at Poplar Road, Stretford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1962, Dent and her mother moved from Stretford to 1 Cokeham Road, Sompting, a village in the coastal Adur District of West Sussex, between Lancing and Worthing. Her mother died on (1967-04-05)5 April 1967 and was cremated at the Downs Crematorium on 10 April 1967. Dent\\'s sister, Florence Mary, also lived in the house until her death on 13 September 1986(1986-09-13) (aged 84). After a brief period as a teacher at a prep school in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, Florence worked as a secretary for a marine insurance firm attached to Lloyd\\'s of London at 12 Leadenhall Street, commuting into London from Harrow each day.:\\u200a57–59\\u200a\\nBeryl May Dent died at Worthing Hospital on 9 August 1977(1977-08-09) (aged 77) after a long period of disablement. The funeral service was held on 12 August 1977 at St Mary\\'s Church, Sompting, followed by cremation. Her ashes were interred at Worthing Crematorium, in the Gardens of Rest, towards the Spring Glades, and her entry in the book of remembrance at the crematorium states:\\n\\nBeryl May Dent 1900 – A real Christian loved by all – 1977\\nThere is also a memorial to her at the Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting. The bishop\\'s chair, situated close to the altar, bears a brass plaque with the following inscription:\\n\\nIn loving memory of BERYL DENT 1900 – 1977\\nHer Christian faith is perhaps not unexpected, given her father\\'s work for the church in Warminster, and the era she grew up in, where religion pervaded social and political life. However, it is notable that she remained a committed Christian while pursuing a scientific career.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn archive of Dent\\'s papers, that relate to her life and work in the 1920s in the physics department at the University of Bristol, is held in the Special Collections of the University of Bristol Arts and Social Sciences Library, in Tyndall Avenue, Bristol. Included in that archive is a series of letterbooks, written in the 1930s by members of the Clifton Hill House Old Students\\' Association, that include news and photographs of Dent, her family, and friends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1928, Lennard‑Jones and Dent published two papers, \"Cohesion at a crystal surface\" and \"The change in lattice spacing at a crystal boundary\", that for the first time, outlined a calculation of the potential of the electric field in a vacuum, produced by a thin sodium chloride crystal surface. They gave an expression for the electric potential produced by a system of point charges in vacuum (although not a real cubic sodium chloride ionic lattice).:\\u200a796–797\\u200a The expression for the potential in vacuum, , at the point r = {x, y, z}, near the cubic lattice of point ions with different signs, the charge , and the period a (a crystalline solid is distinguished by the fact that the atoms making up the crystal are arranged in a periodic fashion), can be represented in the form::\\u200a797\\u200a\\n is the lateral vector that fixes the observation point coordinates in the sample plane.\\n is the reciprocal lattice vector.\\ns is the number of planes to be calculated inside the crystal; s set to zero would calculate the surface plane.\\nThe expression sums the set of potential static charges for the surface and lower planes of the crystal lattice. Lennard‑Jones and Dent showed that this expression forms a rapidly convergent Fourier series.:\\u200a797\\u200a Harold Eugene Buckley, a crystallographic researcher at the University of Manchester until his death in 1959,:\\u200a481\\u200a had suggested that their results should be treated with caution. For example, the contraction a crystal plane would suffer under the conditions prescribed would not be the same as that of a similar plane with a solid mass of crystal behind it. Another difficulty arises because calculation of crystal surface field force fields are so great that simplifying assumptions have to be made to render them capable of a solution.\\nMichael Jaycock and Geoffrey Parfitt, then respectively senior lecturer in surface and colloid chemistry at Loughborough University of Technology and professor of chemical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, concurred with Buckley, noting that \"an ideal crystal, in which the ionic positions at the surface were identical to those achieved in the bulk crystal ... is obviously extremely improbable.\" However, they acknowledged that the Lennard‑Jones and Dent model was singularly elegant, and like most researchers working before the advent of modern computers, they were limited in what could be attempted computationally. Nonetheless, Lennard‑Jones and Dent demonstrated that the force exerted on a single ion, by a surface with evenly distributed positive and negative ions, decreases very rapidly with increasing distance.:\\u200a14\\u200a Later work by Jason Cleveland, Manfred Radmacher, and Paul Hansma, has shown that this result has direct application to atomic force microscopy by predicting that non-contact imaging is possible only at small tip-sample separations.:\\u200a543\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe theoretical underpinnings of standard least squares regression analysis are based on the assumption that the independent variable (often labelled as x) is measured without error as a design variable. The dependent variable (labeled y) is modeled as having uncertainty or error. Both independent and dependent measurements may have multiple sources of error. Therefore, the underlying least squares regression assumptions can be violated. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression is specifically formulated to handle errors in both the x and y variables.:\\u200a1\\u200a If the estimate of the ratio of the error variance of y to the error variance of x is denoted by 𝜆, then the reduced major axis method assumes that 𝜆 can be approximated by the ratio of the total variances of x and y. RMA minimizes both vertical and horizontal distances of the data points from the predicted line (by summing areas) rather than the least squares sum of squared vertical (y-axis) distances.:\\u200a2\\u200a\\nIn Dent\\'s 1935 paper on linear regression, entitled \"On observations of points connected by a linear relation\", she admitted that when the variances in the x and y variables are unknown, \"we cannot hope to find the true positions of the observed points, but only their most probable positions.\" However, by treating the probability of the errors in terms of Gaussian error functions, she contended that this expression may be regarded as \"a function of the unknown quantities\", or the likelihood function of the data distribution.:\\u200a106\\u200a Furthermore, she argued that maximising this function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation,:\\u200a5\\u200a subject to the condition that the points are collinear, will give the parameters for the line of best fit. She then deduced formulae for the errors in estimating the centroid and the line inclination when the data consists of a single (unrepeated) observation.:\\u200a106\\u200a\\nMaurice Kendall and Alan Stuart showed that the maximum likelihood estimator of a likelihood function, depending on a parameter , satisfies the following quadratic equation:\\n\\nwhere  and  are the  and  vectors in a covariance matrix giving the covariance between each pair of x and y variables. The superscript  indicates the transpose of the matrix.\\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for the positive root (or zero) of (2)::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nInspection of (3) shows that as 𝜆 tends to plus infinity, the positive root tends to::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nCorrespondingly, as 𝜆 tends to zero, the root tends to::\\u200a183\\u200a\\n\\nDent had solved the maximum likelihood estimator in the case where the covariance matrix is not known.:\\u200a1049\\u200a Dent\\'s maximum likelihood estimator is the geometric mean of  and , equivalent to::\\u200a184\\u200a\\n\\nDennis Lindley repeated Dent\\'s analysis and stated that Dent\\'s geometric mean estimator is not a consistent estimator for the likelihood function,:\\u200a235–236,\\u200a241\\u200a and that the gradient of the estimate will have a bias, and this remains true even if the number of observations tends to infinity.:\\u200a15\\u200a Subsequently, Theodore Anderson pointed out that the likelihood function has no maximum in this case, and therefore, there is no maximum likelihood estimator.:\\u200a3\\u200a Kenneth Alva Norton, a former consulting engineer with the then National Bureau of Standards, responded to Lindley, stating Lindley\\'s own methods and assumptions lead to a biased prediction. Furthermore, Albert Madansky, late H. G. B. Alexander professor of business administration at University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that Lindley took the wrong root for the quadratic in (2) for the case where  is negative.:\\u200a201–203\\u200a\\nRichard J. Smith has stated that Dent was the first to develop a RMA regression method for line fitting that built on the work of Robert Adcock in \"A Problem in Least Squares\" (1878) and Charles Kummell in \"Reduction of observation equations which contain more than one observed quantity\" (1879). It is now believed that she was the first to propose what is often called the geometric mean functional relationship estimator of slope, and that her essential arguments can be generalised to any number of variables.:\\u200a106\\u200a Moreover, although her solution has its theoretical limitations, it is of practical importance, as it likely represents the best a priori estimate if nothing is known about the true error distribution in the model. It is generally much less reasonable to assume that all the error, or residual scatter, is attributable to one of the variables.:\\u200a3\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 1950s, British electrical engineers would rarely use a digital computer, and if they did, it would be to solve some complicated equation outside the scope of analogue computers. To a certain extent, engineers were deterred by the difficulty and the time taken to program a particular problem. Furthermore, the varied and often unique problems that arise in electrical design practice, together with the degree of uncertainty of the numerical data of many problems, accentuated this tendency. On 10 April 1956, Dent and Brian Birtwistle presented their paper, \"The digital computer as an aid to the electrical design engineer\", to the Convention on Digital Computer Techniques at the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The paper was intended to show, by describing three relatively simple applications, that the digital computer could be a useful aid to the electrical design engineer. The three example problems were:\\n\\nThe Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester was used for the calculations in the three problems. Dent was allowed to use the university\\'s library of subroutines, from which the following were taken and incorporated into the programs:\\n\\nThe first problem of calculating the impulse voltage distribution on transformer windings took about five hours of machine time. Conversely, a hand calculation, using a method described by Thomas John Lewis in \"The Transient Behaviour of Ladder Networks of the Type Representing Transformer and Machine Windings\" (1954), took around three months.:\\u200a486\\u200a The use of a computer in the second problem allowed for a more accurate solution as it was possible to include nonlinear magnetic characteristics in the calculation. In the last problem, the torque and speed curves for the synchronous motors were calculated in around fifteen minutes.:\\u200a486\\u200a Their paper was one of the first to recognise that high-speed digital computers could provide considerable assistance to the electrical design engineer by carrying out automatically the optimum design of products.\\nSignificant research had been devoted to determining a transformer\\'s internal transient voltage distribution. Early attempts were hampered by computational limitations encountered when solving large numbers of coupled differential equations with analogue computers. It was not until Dent, with Hartill and Miles, in \"A method of analysis of transformer impulse voltage distribution using a digital computer\" (1958), recognised the limitations of the analogue models and developed a digital computer model, and associated program, where non-uniformity in the transformer windings could be introduced and any input voltage applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Her instructors included Gustave Choquet, Henri Cartan, and Laurent Schwartz. After her son was born in 1967, her mother came to live with her in Paris to help take care of him. At approximately the same time, she became interested in model theory through a book by Georg Kreisel and Jean-Louis Krivine. She took part in a student protest in 1968, part of the May 1968 events in France, in which most of the students refused to take the oral part of the agrégation exam, but their resistance to the exam did not last and she completed her agrégation in 1969.\\nFollowing this she became a student at the University of Paris, studying mathematical logic, and when it split into multiple universities in 1970 she chose to go to Paris Diderot University.

              " 'The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions\\nand functionals, to find maxima and minima of functionals: mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers. Functionals are often expressed as definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.\\nA simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat\\'s principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, which depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least/stationary action.\\nMany important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of boundary value problems for the Laplace equation satisfy the Dirichlet\\'s principle. Plateau\\'s problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in soapy water. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical formulation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations may be said to begin with Newton\\'s minimal resistance problem in 1687, followed by the brachistochrone curve problem raised by Johann Bernoulli (1696). It immediately occupied the attention of Jacob Bernoulli and the Marquis de l\\'Hôpital, but  Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject, beginning in 1733. Lagrange was influenced by Euler\\'s work to contribute significantly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange, Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange\\'s purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his 1756 lecture Elementa Calculi Variationum.\\nLegendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz also gave some early attention to the subject. To this discrimination Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), Siméon Poisson (1831), Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1834), and Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by Strauch (1849), Jellett (1850), Otto Hesse (1857), Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The 20th and the 23rd Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further development.\\nIn the 20th century David Hilbert, Oskar Bolza, Gilbert Ames Bliss, Emmy Noether, Leonida Tonelli, Henri Lebesgue and Jacques Hadamard among others made significant contributions. Marston Morse applied calculus of variations in what is now called Morse theory. Lev Pontryagin, Ralph Rockafellar and F. H. Clarke developed new mathematical tools for the calculus of variations in optimal control theory. The dynamic programming of Richard Bellman is an alternative to the calculus of variations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps functions to scalars, so functionals have been described as \"functions of functions.\"  Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements  of a given function space defined over a given domain. A functional  is said to have an extremum at the function  if  has the same sign for all  in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of  The function  is called an extremal function or extremal. The extremum  is called a local maximum if  everywhere in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of  and a local minimum if  there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.\\nBoth strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the converse may not hold.  Finding strong extrema is more difficult than finding weak extrema. An example of a necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the Euler–Lagrange equation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero).  The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the functional derivative is equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated Euler–Lagrange equation.\\nConsider the functional\\n\\nwhere\\n are constants,\\n is twice continuously differentiable,\\n is twice continuously differentiable with respect to its arguments  and \\nIf the functional  attains a local minimum at  and  is an arbitrary function that has at least one derivative and vanishes at the endpoints  and  then for any number  close to 0,\\n\\nThe term  is called the variation of the function  and is denoted by \\nSubstituting  for  in the functional  the result is a function of \\nSince the functional  has a minimum for  the function  has a minimum at  and thus,\\n\\nTaking the total derivative of  where  and  are considered as functions of  rather than  yields\\n\\nand because  and \\nTherefore,\\n\\nwhere  when  and we have used integration by parts on the second term.  The second term on the second line vanishes because  at  and  by definition.  Also, as previously mentioned the left side of the equation is zero so that\\n\\nAccording to the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, the part of the integrand in parentheses is zero, i.e.\\n\\nwhich is called the Euler–Lagrange equation.  The left hand side of this equation is called the functional derivative of  and is denoted \\nIn general this gives a second-order ordinary differential equation which can be solved to obtain the extremal function   The Euler–Lagrange equation is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an extremum   A sufficient condition for a minimum is given in the section Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to illustrate this process, consider the problem of finding the extremal function  which is the shortest curve that connects two points  and  The arc length of the curve is given by\\n\\nwith\\n\\nNote that assuming y is a function of x loses generality; ideally both should be a function of some other parameter. This approach is good solely for instructive purposes.\\nThe Euler–Lagrange equation will now be used to find the extremal function  that minimizes the functional \\nwith\\n\\nSince  does not appear explicitly in  the first term in the Euler–Lagrange equation vanishes for all  and thus,\\n\\nSubstituting for  and taking the derivative,\\n\\nThus\\n\\nfor some constant  Then\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nSolving, we get\\n\\nwhich implies that\\n\\nis a constant and therefore that the shortest curve that connects two points  and  is\\n\\nand we have thus found the extremal function  that minimizes the functional  so that  is a minimum. The equation for a straight line is  In other words, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn physics problems it may be the case that  meaning the integrand is a function of  and  but  does not appear separately. In that case, the Euler–Lagrange equation can be simplified to the Beltrami identity\\n\\nwhere  is a constant. The left hand side is the Legendre transformation of  with respect to \\nThe intuition behind this result is that, if the variable  is actually time, then the statement  implies that the Lagrangian is time-independent. By Noether\\'s theorem, there is an associated conserved quantity. In this case, this quantity is the Hamiltonian, the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, which (often) coincides with the energy of the system. This is (minus) the constant in Beltrami\\'s identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf  depends on higher-derivatives of  that is, if  then  must satisfy the Euler–Poisson equation,\\n\\n\\n\\nThe discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives, although the existence of the integral  requires only first derivatives of trial functions. The condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler–Lagrange equation. The theorem of Du Bois-Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form. If  has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its arguments, and if\\n\\nthen  has two continuous derivatives, and it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation.\\n\\n\\n\\nHilbert was the first to give good conditions for the Euler–Lagrange equations to give a stationary solution. Within a convex area and a positive thrice differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equations in the interior.\\nHowever Lavrentiev in 1926 showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing numbers of sections. The Lavrentiev Phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions. For instance the following problem, presented by Manià in 1934:\\n\\nClearly, minimizes the functional, but we find any function  gives a value bounded away from the infimum.\\nExamples (in one-dimension) are traditionally manifested across  and  but Ball and Mizel procured the first functional that displayed Lavrentiev\\'s Phenomenon across  and  for  There are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur - for instance \\'standard growth\\', a Lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable, or an approximating sequence satisfying Cesari\\'s Condition (D) - but results are often particular, and applicable to a small class of functionals. \\nConnected with the Lavrentiev Phenomenon is the repulsion property: any functional displaying Lavrentiev\\'s Phenomenon will display the weak repulsion property.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example, if  denotes the displacement of a membrane above the domain  in the  plane, then its potential energy is proportional to its surface area:\\n\\nPlateau\\'s problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of ; the solutions are called minimal surfaces.

Riemann argued that the existence of a smooth minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem: membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy. Riemann named this idea the Dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. However Weierstrass gave an example of a variational problem with no solution: minimize\\n\\namong all functions  that satisfy  and  can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition between −1 and 1 in a small neighborhood of the origin. However, there is no function that makes  Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet\\'s principle is valid, but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li–Jost (1998).\\n\\n\\n\\nA more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is\\n\\nThis corresponds to an external force density  in  an external force  on the boundary  and elastic forces with modulus acting on  The function that minimizes the potential energy with no restriction on its boundary values will be denoted by  Provided that  and  are continuous, regularity theory implies that the minimizing function  will have two derivatives.

Therefore, the variational problem is meaningless unless\\n\\nThis condition implies that net external forces on the system are in equilibrium. If these forces are in equilibrium, then the variational problem has a solution, but it is not unique, since an arbitrary constant may be added.

The associated minimizing function will be denoted by  This variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the Rayleigh–Ritz method: choose an approximating  as a linear combination of basis functions (for example trigonometric functions) and carry out a finite-dimensional minimization among such linear combinations. This method is often surprisingly accurate.\\nThe next smallest eigenvalue and eigenfunction can be obtained by minimizing  under the additional constraint\\n\\nThis procedure can be extended to obtain the complete sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem.\\nThe variational problem also applies to more general boundary conditions. Instead of requiring that  vanish at the endpoints, we may not impose any condition at the endpoints, and set\\n\\nwhere  and  are arbitrary.

Snell\\'s law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell\\'s law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of the optical path length.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is expedient to use vector notation: let  let  be a parameter,  let  be the parametric representation of a curve  and let  be its tangent vector.

Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light.

In this context, \"statistical properties\" refers to properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.\\nErgodic theory, like probability theory, is based on general notions of measure theory.  Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.\\nA central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time.

Systems for which the Poincaré recurrence theorem holds are conservative systems; thus all ergodic systems are conservative.\\nMore precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a time average along each trajectory. For the special class of ergodic systems, this time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time \"forgets\" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as mixing and equidistribution, have also been extensively studied.\\nThe problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.\\nThe concepts of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis are central to applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErgodic theory is often concerned with ergodic transformations.  The intuition behind such transformations, which act on a given set, is that they do a thorough job \"stirring\" the elements of that set. E.g. if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if a spoonful of syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout.  At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.\\nThe formal definition is as follows: \\nLet T : X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ), with μ(X) = 1.  Then T is ergodic if for every E in Σ with μ(T−1(E) Δ E) = 0 (that is, E is invariant), either μ(E) = 0 or μ(E) = 1.\\nThe operator Δ here is the symmetric difference of sets, equivalent to the exclusive-or operation with respect to set membership. The condition that the symmetric difference be measure zero is called being essentially invariant.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn irrational rotation of the circle R/Z, T: x → x + θ, where θ is irrational, is ergodic. This transformation has even stronger properties of unique ergodicity, minimality, and equidistribution. By contrast, if θ = p/q is rational (in lowest terms) then T is periodic, with period q, and thus cannot be ergodic: for any interval I of length a, 0 < a < 1/q, its orbit under T (that is, the union of I, T(I), ..., Tq−1(I), which contains the image of I under any number of applications of T) is a T-invariant mod 0 set that is a union of q intervals of length a, hence it has measure qa strictly between 0 and 1.\\nLet G be a compact abelian group, μ the normalized Haar measure, and T a group automorphism of G. Let G* be the Pontryagin dual group, consisting of the continuous characters of G, and T* be the corresponding adjoint automorphism of G*. The automorphism T is ergodic if and only if the equality (T*)n(χ) = χ is possible only when n = 0 or χ is the trivial character of G. In particular, if G is the n-dimensional torus and the automorphism T is represented by a unimodular matrix A then T is ergodic if and only if no eigenvalue of A is a root of unity.\\nA Bernoulli shift is ergodic. More generally, ergodicity of the shift transformation associated with a sequence of i.i.d. random variables and some more general stationary processes follows from Kolmogorov\\'s zero–one law.\\nErgodicity of a continuous dynamical system means that its trajectories \"spread around\" the phase space. A system with a compact phase space which has a non-constant first integral cannot be ergodic. This applies, in particular, to Hamiltonian systems with a first integral I functionally independent from the Hamilton function H and a compact level set X = {(p,q): H(p,q) = E} of constant energy. Liouville\\'s theorem implies the existence of a finite invariant measure on X, but the dynamics of the system is constrained to the level sets of I on X, hence the system possesses invariant sets of positive but less than full measure. A property of continuous dynamical systems that is the opposite of ergodicity is complete integrability.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet T: X → X be a measure-preserving transformation on a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and suppose ƒ is a μ-integrable function, i.e. ƒ ∈ L1(μ). Then we define the following averages:\\n\\n Time average: This is defined as the average (if it exists) over iterations of T starting from some initial point x:\\n\\n Space average: If μ(X) is finite and nonzero, we can consider the space or phase average of ƒ:\\n\\nIn general the time average and space average may be different. But if the transformation is ergodic, and the measure is invariant, then the time average is equal to the space average almost everywhere. This is the celebrated ergodic theorem, in an abstract form due to George David Birkhoff.  (Actually, Birkhoff\\'s paper considers not the abstract general case but only the case of dynamical systems arising from differential equations on a smooth manifold.) The equidistribution theorem is a special case of the ergodic theorem, dealing specifically with the distribution of probabilities on the unit interval.\\nMore precisely, the pointwise or strong ergodic theorem states that the limit in the definition of the time average of ƒ exists for almost every x and that the (almost everywhere defined) limit function  is integrable:\\n\\nFurthermore,  is T-invariant, that is to say\\n\\nholds almost everywhere, and if μ(X) is finite, then the normalization is the same:\\n\\nIn particular, if T is ergodic, then  must be a constant (almost everywhere), and so one has that\\n\\nalmost everywhere. Joining the first to the last claim and assuming that μ(X) is finite and nonzero, one has that\\n\\nfor almost all x, i.e., for all x except for a set of measure zero.\\nFor an ergodic transformation, the time average equals the space average almost surely.\\nAs an example, assume that the measure space (X, Σ, μ) models the particles of a gas as above, and let ƒ(x) denote the velocity of the particle at position x. Then the pointwise ergodic theorems says that the average velocity of all particles at some given time is equal to the average velocity of one particle over time.\\nA generalization of Birkhoff\\'s theorem is Kingman\\'s subadditive ergodic theorem.\\n\\n\\n\\nBirkhoff–Khinchin theorem. Let ƒ be measurable, E(|ƒ|) < ∞, and T be a measure-preserving map. Then with probability 1:\\n\\nwhere  is the conditional expectation given the σ-algebra  of invariant sets of T.\\nCorollary (Pointwise Ergodic Theorem): In particular, if T is also ergodic, then  is the trivial σ-algebra, and thus with probability 1:\\n\\n\\n\\nVon Neumann\\'s mean ergodic theorem, holds in Hilbert spaces.\\nLet U be a unitary operator on a Hilbert space H; more generally, an isometric linear operator (that is, a not necessarily surjective linear operator satisfying ‖Ux‖ = ‖x‖ for all x in H, or equivalently, satisfying U*U = I, but not necessarily UU* = I). Let P be the orthogonal projection onto {ψ ∈ H | Uψ = ψ} = ker(I − U).\\nThen, for any x in H, we have:\\n\\nwhere the limit is with respect to the norm on H.  In other words, the sequence of averages\\n\\nconverges to P in the strong operator topology.\\nIndeed, it is not difficult to see that in this case any  admits an orthogonal decomposition into parts from  and  respectively. The former part is invariant in all the partial sums as  grows, while for the latter part, from the telescoping series one would have:\\n\\nThis theorem specializes to the case in which the Hilbert space H consists of L2 functions on a measure space and U is an operator of the form\\n\\nwhere T is a measure-preserving endomorphism of X, thought of in applications as representing a time-step of a discrete dynamical system.  The ergodic theorem then asserts that the average behavior of a function ƒ over sufficiently large time-scales is approximated by the orthogonal component of ƒ which is time-invariant.\\nIn another form of the mean ergodic theorem, let Ut be a strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators on H.  Then the operator\\n\\nconverges in the strong operator topology as T → ∞. In fact, this result also extends to the case of strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of contractive operators on a reflexive space.\\nRemark: Some intuition for the mean ergodic theorem can be developed by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which we think of as U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, it makes sense that the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0. Also, 0 is the only fixed point of U, and so the projection onto the space of fixed points must be the zero operator (which agrees with the  limit just described).\\n\\n\\n\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be as above a probability space with a measure preserving transformation T, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. The conditional expectation with respect to the sub-σ-algebra ΣT of the T-invariant sets is a linear projector ET of norm 1 of the Banach space Lp(X, Σ, μ) onto its closed subspace Lp(X, ΣT, μ). The latter may also be characterized as the space of all T-invariant Lp-functions on X. The ergodic means, as linear operators on Lp(X, Σ, μ) also have unit operator norm; and, as a simple consequence of the Birkhoff–Khinchin theorem, converge to the projector ET in the strong operator topology of Lp if 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, and in the weak operator topology if p = ∞. More is true if 1 < p ≤ ∞ then the Wiener–Yoshida–Kakutani ergodic dominated convergence theorem states that the ergodic means of ƒ ∈ Lp are dominated in Lp; however, if ƒ ∈ L1, the ergodic means may fail to be equidominated in Lp. Finally, if ƒ is assumed to be in the Zygmund class, that is |ƒ| log+(|ƒ|) is integrable, then the ergodic means are even dominated in L1.\\n\\n\\n\\nLet (X, Σ, μ) be a measure space such that μ(X) is finite and nonzero. The time spent in a measurable set A is called the sojourn time.  An immediate consequence of the ergodic theorem is that, in an ergodic system, the relative measure of A is equal to the mean sojourn time:\\n\\nfor all x except for a set of measure zero, where χA is the indicator function of A.\\nThe occurrence times of a measurable set A is defined as the set k1, k2, k3, ..., of times k such that Tk(x) is in A, sorted in increasing order. The differences between consecutive occurrence times Ri = ki − ki−1 are called the recurrence times of A. Another consequence of the ergodic theorem is that the average recurrence time of A is inversely proportional to the measure of A, assuming that the initial point x is in A, so that k0 = 0.\\n\\n(See almost surely.) That is, the smaller A is, the longer it takes to return to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact Riemann surfaces of variable negative curvature and on compact manifolds of constant negative curvature of any dimension was proved by Eberhard Hopf in 1939, although special cases had been studied earlier: see for example, Hadamard\\'s billiards (1898) and Artin billiard (1924). The relation between geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces and one-parameter subgroups on SL(2, R) was described in 1952 by S. V. Fomin and I. M. Gelfand. The article on Anosov flows provides an example of ergodic flows on SL(2, R) and on Riemann surfaces of negative curvature.  Much of the development described there generalizes to hyperbolic manifolds, since they can be viewed as quotients of the hyperbolic space by the action of a lattice in the semisimple Lie group SO(n,1). Ergodicity of the geodesic flow on Riemannian symmetric spaces was demonstrated by F. I. Mautner in 1957. In 1967 D. V. Anosov and Ya. G. Sinai proved ergodicity of the geodesic flow on compact manifolds of variable negative sectional curvature. A simple criterion for the ergodicity of a homogeneous flow on a homogeneous space of a semisimple Lie group was given by Calvin C. Moore in 1966.  Many of the theorems and results from this area of study are typical of rigidity theory.\\nIn the 1930s G. A. Hedlund proved that the horocycle flow on a compact hyperbolic surface is minimal and ergodic. Unique ergodicity of the flow was established by Hillel Furstenberg in 1972. Ratner\\'s theorems provide a major generalization of ergodicity for unipotent flows on the homogeneous spaces of the form Γ \\\\ G, where G is a Lie group and Γ is a lattice in G.\\nIn the last 20 years, there have been many works trying to find a measure-classification theorem similar to Ratner\\'s theorems but for diagonalizable actions, motivated by conjectures of Furstenberg and Margulis. An important partial result (solving those conjectures with an extra assumption of positive entropy) was proved by Elon Lindenstrauss, and he was awarded the Fields medal in 2010 for this result.\\n\\n\\n\\nChaos theory\\nErgodic hypothesis\\nErgodic process\\nKruskal principle\\nLindy effect\\nLyapunov time – the time limit to the predictability of the system\\nMaximal ergodic theorem\\nOrnstein isomorphism theorem\\nStatistical mechanics\\nSymbolic dynamics\\n\\n\\n',\n",

During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office (German: Auswärtiges Amt) colloquially known as Pers Z S. After the war, she became editor-in-chief of Zentralblatt MATH.\\n\\n\\n\\nErika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor School in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922.  She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and Göttingen (1928).  After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt. Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below:\\n\\nThe author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem posed to her through completely independent investigations; she has achieved this goal through the appropriate choice of new terms, through understanding and deep insight into the difficult material presented to her, through the mastery of older methods and their novel use, and has thus demonstrated her scientific maturity in this, her first dissertation.\\nSince, in my opinion, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective achievement in it exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the work submitted by Miss Pannwitz as a dissertation with the rating \"eximium\".\\nSchmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis:\\n\\nI certainly agree with Mr Hopf\\'s vote. Topology is one of the most promising but at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still in its infancy, so that any valuable result can only be achieved with a high degree of strong inventiveness. Through the present work, topology has been enriched by a series of extraordinarily beautiful theorems\\nIn her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points.  The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik. This was due to the difficulty of women achieving an academic career in the 1930\\'s, who found their career path blocked into higher education. It was also due to Pannwitz along with many other German mathematicians not wanting to provide support to the Nazis, despite her excellent dissertion. From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort.  After Germany\\'s defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt für Mathematik, and after the death of its previous editor-in-chief, Hermann Ludwig Schmid, in 1956, she became editor-in-chief.  Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin.  East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964.  From 1964 until her retirement in 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.\\nAlthough Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position.

At Berkeley, she did well on her exams and was known as the \"bright female.\" However, she struggled in the early stages of her dissertation work and switched supervisors to Stephen Smale. Smale suggested a problem which Kopell almost singlehandedly solved, leading to her thesis in the field of dynamical systems which catapulted her career.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter completing her graduate education, Kopell accepted an instructorship at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, she met collaborator Lou Howard, with whom she published several articles. She later met her husband, Gabriel Stolzenberg, at Northeastern University.\\nWhile Kopell did her thesis work in theoretical mathematics, she later switched to applied mathematics.\\nIn 1969, she joined Northeastern University as faculty, becoming a full professor in 1978. In 1986, she became a professor of mathematics at Boston University and in 2009 she became the first woman at Boston University to be named a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor. She was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1990 for her work developing methods of dynamical systems to attack problems of applied mathematics. She is currently Director and Co-Founder of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, which consists of a group of over two dozen labs, mostly in the Boston Area, working on brain dynamics and their cognitive implications. She is also Co-Director of the Center for Computational Neuroscience and Neural Technology (CompNet).\\nKopell is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

              " 'Marie-Sophie Germain (French: [maʁi sɔfi ʒɛʁmɛ̃]; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father\\'s library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur LeBlanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life. Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred. On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the National Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.\\nMarie-Sophie had one younger sister, Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of \"Maries\" may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain\\'s nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline\\'s son, published some of Germain\\'s work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father\\'s library. Here she found J. E. Montucla\\'s L\\'Histoire des Mathématiques, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.\\nGermain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father\\'s library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d\\'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.\\nGermain\\'s parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1794, when Germain was 18, the École Polytechnique opened. As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the \"lecture notes available to all who asked\". The new method also required the students to \"submit written observations\". Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc, \"fearing\", as she later explained to Gauss, \"the ridicule attached to a female scientist\".  When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman, and he became her mentor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published Essai sur la théorie des nombres. After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain\\'s work in the Supplément to his second edition of the Théorie des Nombres, where he calls it très ingénieuse (\"very ingenious\"). See also Her work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem below.\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss\\' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. Le Blanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss\\' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain\\'s work on Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n = p − 1, where p is a prime number of the form p = 8k + 7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss\\' reply did not comment on Germain\\'s proof.\\nAround 1807 (sources differ), during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss\\' safety.  General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie\\'s name.\\nThree months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss.  He replied:\\n\\nHow can I describe my astonishment and admiration on seeing my esteemed correspondent M. Le Blanc metamorphosed into this celebrated person ... when a woman, because of her sex, our customs and prejudices, encounters infinitely more obstacles than men in familiarising herself with [number theory\\'s] knotty problems, yet overcomes these fetters and penetrates that which is most hidden, she doubtless has the noblest courage, extraordinary talent, and superior genius.\\n\\nGauss\\' letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere. In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if  is of the form , then  is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample:  can be written as , but  cannot.\\nAlthough Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work. Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased. Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Germain\\'s correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni\\'s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the academy, was \"to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence\". Lagrange\\'s comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant, and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.\\nIn 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research. She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that \"the true equations of the movement were not established\", even though \"the experiments presented ingenious results\". Lagrange was able to use Germain\\'s work to derive an equation that was \"correct under special assumptions\".\\n\\n\\n\\nThe contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help. Germain\\'s anonymous 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals, and it received only an honorable mention because \"the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established\". The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson. In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain\\'s help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the academy commission, had had access to her work).\\nGermain submitted her third paper, \"Recherches sur la théorie des surfaces élastiques\", under her own name, and on 8 January 1816 she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award. Although Germain had at last been awarded the prix extraordinaire, the academy was still not fully satisfied. Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff–Love equation), but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler, which led to incorrect boundary conditions. Here is Germain\\'s final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:\\n\\nwhere N2 is a constant.\\nAfter winning the academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the academy\\'s tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.\\nIn 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by \"introducing certain simplifying hypotheses\". This put the academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be \"inadequate and trivial\", but they did not want to \"treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work\". So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.\\nOne further work of Germain\\'s on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her \"Mémoire sur la courbure des surfaces\". She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s best work was in number theory, and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem. It reawakened Germain\\'s interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.\\nIn the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain\\'s letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFermat\\'s Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers p that do not divide any of x, y, or z. Case 2 includes all p that divide at least one of x, y, or z. Germain proposed the following, commonly called \"Sophie Germain\\'s theorem\":\\n\\nLet p be an odd prime. If there exists an auxiliary prime P = 2Np + 1 (N is any positive integer not divisible by 3) such that:\\nif xp + yp + zp ≡ 0 (mod P), then P divides xyz, and\\np is not a p-th power residue (mod P).\\nThen the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem holds true for p.\\nGermain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes p < 100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, \"she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent p < 197\". L. E. Dickson later used Germain\\'s theorem to prove the first case of Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.\\nIn an unpublished manuscript titled Remarque sur l\\'impossibilité de satisfaire en nombres entiers a l\\'équation xp + yp = zp, Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat\\'s theorem for p > 5 must be numbers \"whose size frightens the imagination\", around 40 digits long.  Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre\\'s treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat\\'s Last Theorem for p = 5 (see Correspondence with Legendre).  Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later. Del Centina states that \"after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central\", but ultimately her method did not work.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology. She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.\\nTwo of her philosophical works, Pensées diverses and Considérations générales sur l\\'état des sciences et des lettres, aux différentes époques de leur culture, were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them.  Pensées is a history of science and mathematics with Germain\\'s commentary. In Considérations, the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no differences between the sciences and the humanities.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain, she continued to work. In 1831 Crelle\\'s Journal published her paper on the curvature of elastic surfaces and \"a note about finding y and z in \". Mary Gray records: \"She also published in Annales de chimie et de physique an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.\" On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.\\nDespite Germain\\'s intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a \"rentière – annuitant\" (property holder), not a \"mathématicienne\". But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of Göttingen in 1837—six years after Germain\\'s death—Gauss lamented: \"she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain\\'s resting place in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone.  At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls\\' school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.\\nIn January 2020, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Sophie Germain.\\n\\n\\n\\nE. Dubouis defined a sophien of a prime n to be a prime θ where θ = kn + 1, for such n that yield θ such that xn = yn + 1 (mod θ) has no solutions when x and y are prime to n.\\nA Sophie Germain prime is a prime p such that 2p + 1 is also prime.\\nThe Germain curvature (also called mean curvature) is , where k1 and k2 are the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature.\\nSophie Germain\\'s identity states that for any {x, y},\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVesna Petrovich found that the educated world\\'s response to the publication in 1821 of Germain\\'s prize-winning essay \"ranged from polite to indifferent\". Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: \"[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians\". Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans\\' 1913 book Woman in Science, although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography \"is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable\". Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that \"it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write\".\\nGermain\\'s contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics.  Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, \"Germain\\'s work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.\" Petrovich adds: \"This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.\"\\nNotwithstanding the problems with Germain\\'s theory of vibrations, Gray states that \"Germain\\'s work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.\" Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel Tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain\\'s name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower\\'s construction. Mozans asked: \"Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.\"\\nConcerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: \"She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the Disquisitiones, and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.\" Gray adds on to say \"The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.\" Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that \"Sophie Germain\\'s creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems\", and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches. Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain\\'s biographers, summarize as follows: \"All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nGermain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn\\'s 2001 play Proof. The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden\\'s film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).\\nIn the fictional work \"The Last Theorem\" by Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl, Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve Fermat\\'s Last Theorem.\\nA musical about Sophie Germain\\'s life, entitled The Limit, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Sophie Germain Prize (French: Prix Sophie Germain), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the Academy of Sciences in Paris.

She earned her Bachelors at City College CUNY in Mathematics. She completed her doctorate at Courant Institute NYU in 1964 under the joint supervision of Lipman Bers and Cathleen Morawetz.  Her thesis concerned partial differential equations of mixed-type.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1964, Lesley Sibner became an instructor at Stanford University for two years. She was a Fulbright Scholar at the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris the following year.  At this time, in addition to solo work on the Tricomi equation and compressible flows, she began working with her husband Robert Sibner on a problem suggested by Lipman Bers: do there exists compressible flows on a Riemann surface?  As part of her work in this direction, she studied differential geometry and Hodge theory eventually proving a nonlinear Hodge–DeRham theorem with Robert Sibner based on a physical interpretation of one-dimensional harmonic forms on closed manifolds. The techniques are related to her prior work on compressible flows.  They kept working together on related problems and applications of this important work for many years.\\nIn 1967 she joined the faculty at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, New York.  In 1969 she proved the Morse index theorem for degenerate elliptic operators by extending classical Sturm–Liouville theory.\\nIn 1971-1972 she spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study where she met Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott. She realized she could use her knowledge of analysis to solve geometric problems related to the Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem.  In 1974, \\nLesley and Robert Sibner produced a constructive proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem.\\nKaren Uhlenbeck suggested that Lesley Sibner work on Yang-Mills equation.  In 1979-1980 she visited Harvard University where she learned gauge field theory from Clifford Taubes. This lead results about point singularities in the Yang-Mills equation and the Yang–Mills–Higgs equations.  Her interest in singularities soon brought her deeper into geometry, leading to a classification of singular connections and to a condition for removing two-dimensional singularities in work with Robert Sibner.\\nRealizing that instantons could under certain circumstances be viewed as monopoles, the Sibners and Uhlenbeck constructed non-minimal unstable critical points of the Yang-Mills functional over the four-sphere in 1989.  She was invited to present this work at the Geometry Festival. She was a Bunting Scholar at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in 1991.

              " 'Michèle Audin (Algiers, 3 January, 1954) is a French mathematician, writer, and a former professor. She has worked as a professor at the University of Geneva, the University of Paris-Saclay and most recently at the University of Strasbourg, where she performed research notably in the area of symplectic geometry.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichéle Audin is the daughter of mathematician Maurice Audin and mathematics teacher Josette Audin, both pied-noirs and political activists for the independence of Algeria. While she was a child, her father died under torture in June 1957 in Algeria, after being arrested by General Jacques Massu\\'s paratroopers.\\nShe studied at the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles (now merged into the École Normale Supérieure but at the time a separate institution) and then she earned a Ph.D. degree in 1986 from the University of Paris-Saclay, with a thesis written under the supervision of François Latour, entitled Cobordismes d\\'immersions lagrangiennes et legendriens [Cobordisms of Lagrangian and Legendrian immersions].\\nShe then became a professor at the Institut de recherche mathématique avancée (IRMA) of the Université de Strasbourg from 1987 until her early retirement in 2014. She was president of the association Femmes et mathématiques in 1990 and 1991.\\nIn 2009 she refused to receive the Legion of Honour, on the grounds that the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, had refused to respond to a letter written by her mother regarding the disappearance of her father. Finally in September 2018, French president Emmanuel Macron admitted that Maurice Audin was tortured to death and apologized on behalf of France.\\nIn 2013 she was awarded the Prix Ève Delacroix for her novel Une vie brève.\\n\\n\\n\\nMichèle Audin\\'s research work mainly belongs to the field of symplectic geometry. Her PhD thesis draws on René Thom\\'s theory of cobordism to contribute to the founding program of symplectic topology launched by the Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold. Audin then oriented her research to dynamical aspects, and more specifically to Hamiltonian systems.\\nIn her monograph \"Spinning tops: A Course on Integrable Systems\", Audin discusses in detail the question of whether a dynamical system is integrable, a central question of her later research. A particularly enlightening example comes from her article \"Sur la réduction symplectique appliquée à la non-intégrabilité du problème du satellite\".\\nAudin\\'s work on Kovalevskaya top led her to write another book, both mathematical, historical and more personal on this mathematician: \"Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya\". She also published the correspondence (1928-1991) of two members of the Bourbaki group, the mathematicians Henri Cartan and André Weil, she wrote the first biography of the mathematician Jacques Feldbau, and she documented the genesis of the modern holomorphic dynamics, with detailed portraits of the main protagonists: Pierre Fatou, Gaston Julia and Paul Montel.\\nShe contributes regularly on historical subjects to the mathematics popularisation website Images des mathématiques.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlongside her activity as a mathematician, Audin leads an intense literary activity on her own and, since 2009, within the Oulipo.\\n\\n\\n\\nPassionate about the insurrection of the Paris Commune of 1871, Audin has written five books on this topic to document its history as well as its memory: two novels published by Gallimard, Comme une rivière bleue (2017) and Josée Meunier, 19 rue des Juifs (2021), as well as three historical books published by Libertalia. The first, Eugène Varlin, bookbinding worker 1839-1871 (2019), is an anthology of the various writings of Eugène Varlin, some of which have not been published since their original release. The second, C\\'est la nuit surtout que le combat devient furieux (2020), publishes the correspondence between Alix Payen, an unknown paramedic, and her Fourierist family, during the few months of the Parisian insurrection. The last, La Semaine sanglante: Mai 1871. Légendes et comptes (2021), proposes a new counting of the deaths of Bloody Week, going up to “certainly 15,000 dead”.\\n\\n\\n\\nAudin was guest of honor at a meeting of Oulipo on the initiative of Jacques Roubaud, following the publication of her book Souvenirs sur Sofia Kovalevskaya, which mixes in a discontinuous form anecdotes, precise mathematics, testimonials, excerpts of correspondence with commentary and even literary pastiches. There are references to the Oulipo in testimonial chapters entitled “Je me souviens” in reference to Georges Perec, or even in a pastiche of Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino.\\nShe became part of Oulipo in 2009, as the first member to be both a mathematician and a writer. Mathematics is for her both a source of inspiration for the constraints she invents and a recurring theme in her literary work. For example, in her novel La formule de Stokes, the heroine is a mathematical formula.\\nShe invented constraints of a geometric nature such as Pascal\\'s or Désargues\\' constraint. Pascal\\'s constraint was experienced in her online story Mai Quai Conti which evokes the history of the Académie des sciences during the Paris Commune: the relationships between the characters of the story are determined by the position of the points of a geometric figure illustrating Pascal\\'s theorem.\\nShe also worked with Ian Monk on nonine, i.e. a variant of the sestina based on numbers which are not Queneau numbers, and therefore with which the system of permutation of the sestina does not work.\\nHer first novel, Cent vingt et un jours, is based on an onzine, i.e. a quenine of order 11 (variant of the sestina) from which characters, literary references and other elements of the narrative permute in a regulated manner. As in the poetic sestina, the last word of a chapter is the same as the first word of the next chapter. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(in French) La formule de Stokes, roman, Cassini, 2016.\\n(in French) Mademoiselle Haas, Gallimard, 2016.\\n(in French) Cent vingt et un jours, Gallimard, 2014.

She was the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was 8 months old of complications from influenza. This left her mother, a primary school teacher, to care for the children.\\nBusbridge started her schooling at 6 in a school in her mother's district.  She moved schools to Christ's Hospital in 1918, having won a scholarship at the age of ten. Here she received a firm grounding in mathematics from Miss Mitchener. Busbridge became head girl of the school and was later described as the most brilliant pupil in its 400-year history.\\nIn 1926 she enrolled in Royal Holloway College, London, intending to specialise in physics, but switched to mathematics in 1928. She turned down a place at Newnham College Cambridge as the scholarship to Royal Holloway was significantly more generous. During her schooling she was involved in the Choral Society and University Choir along with the Science Discussion Society.\\nBusbridge graduated in 1929 with first class honours and was the awarded the Sir John Lubbock Prize for best first class honours of all London University Colleges.

Her workload was especially great - not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service - but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.  She was appointed to a Fellowship of St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1946 – the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.\\nIn 1962, she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by Oxford.

              " \"Helena Rasiowa (20 June 1917 – 9 August 1994) was a Polish mathematician. She worked in the foundations of mathematics and algebraic logic.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa was born in Vienna on 20 June 1917 to Polish parents. As soon as Poland regained its independence in 1918, the family settled in Warsaw. Helena's father was a  railway specialist. She exhibited many different skills and interests, from music to business management and the most important of her interests, mathematics.\\nIn 1938, the time was not very opportune for entering a university. Rasiowa had to interrupt her studies, as no legal education was possible in Poland after 1939. Many people fled the country, or at least they fled the big towns, which were subject to German bombardment and terror. The Rasiowa family fled also, as most high-ranking administration officials and members of the government were being evacuated to Romania. The family spent a year in Lviv. After the Soviet invasion in September 1939, the town was taken over by the Soviet Union. The lives of many Poles became endangered, so Helena's father decided to return to Warsaw.\\n\\n\\n\\nRasiowa became strongly influenced by Polish logicians. She wrote her Master's thesis under the supervision of Jan Łukasiewicz and Bolesław Sobociński. In 1944, the Warsaw Uprising broke out and consequently Warsaw was almost completely destroyed. This was not only due to the immediate fighting, but also because of the systematic destruction which followed the uprising after it had been suppressed. Rasiowa's thesis burned with the whole house. She herself survived with her mother in a cellar covered by the ruins of the demolished building.\\nAfter the war, Polish mathematics began to recover its institutions, its moods, and its people. Those who remained considered their duty to be the reconstruction of Polish universities and the scientific community. One of the important conditions for this reconstruction was to gather all those who could participate in re-creating mathematics. In the meantime, Rasiowa had accepted a teaching position in a secondary school. That is where she met Andrzej Mostowski and came back to the university. She re-wrote her Master's thesis in 1945 and in the next year she started her academic career as an assistant at the University of Warsaw, the institution she remained linked with for the rest of her life.\\nAt the university, she prepared and defended her PhD thesis, Algebraic Treatment of the Functional Calculi of Lewis and Heyting, in 1950 under the guidance of Prof. Andrzej Mostowski. This thesis on algebraic logic initiated her career contributing to the Lwów–Warsaw school of logic: In 1956, she took her second academic degree, doktor nauk (equivalent to habilitation today) in the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where between 1954 and 1957, she held a post of associate professor, becoming a professor in 1957 and subsequently Full Professor in 1967. For the degree, she submitted two papers, Algebraic Models of Axiomatic Theories and Constructive Theories, which together formed a thesis named Algebraic Models of Elementary Theories and their Applications.\\nRasiowa was pivotal in her role for inviting many international mathematicians, especially logicians, to Poland in the late '70s and early '80s, despite the country's instability at the time. According to Japanese mathematician Hiroakira Ono, she enabled collaboration through her iron will.\\n\\n\\n\\n1963: (with Roman Sikorski) The Mathematics of Metamathematics\\n1974: An Algebraic Approach to Non-Classical Logics\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

              " 'Lisa Marie Piccirillo (born 1990 or 1991) is an American mathematician who works on Geometry and low-dimensional topology. In 2020, Piccirillo published a mathematical proof in the journal Annals of Mathematics determining that the Conway knot is not a slice knot, answering an unsolved problem in knot theory first proposed over fifty years prior by English mathematician John Horton Conway. In July 2020, she became an assistant professor of mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiccirillo was raised in Greenwood, Maine, and attended Telstar Regional High School in Bethel, Maine. Her mother was a middle school math teacher. As a child, she had many hobbies, such as riding dressage, being involved in her church\\'s youth group, and participating in drama and band in school.\\n\\n\\n\\nPiccirillo earned a B.S. in mathematics from Boston College in 2013 and a PhD in low-dimensional topology at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of John Luecke in 2019, followed by postdoctoral research at Brandeis University. Boston College professor Elisenda Grigsby cited Piccirillo\\'s creativity as contributing to her success, adding that Piccirillo did not fit the mold of a \"standard golden child math prodigy\" during her undergraduate studies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Conway knot was named after its discoverer, English mathematician John Horton Conway, who first wrote about the knot in 1970. The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however, the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice (whether or not it was a slice of a higher dimensional knot), eluded mathematicians for half a century, making it a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory. This changed with Lisa Piccirillo\\'s work on the Conway knot, which completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified.\\n\\nPiccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry. She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time to \"see what\\'s so hard about this problem\" before finding an answer: I think the next day, which was a Sunday, I just started trying to run the approach for fun and I worked on it a bit in the evenings just to try to see what\\'s supposed to be hard about this problem.Before the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is not “slice”. A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon (mathematician), a professor at UT Austin (a senior topologist), and casually mentioned her solution. In her interview with Quanta Magazine, she described her interaction with Gordon in the following way:And then the following week, I had a meeting with Cameron Gordon, a senior topologist in my department, about something else, and I mentioned it to him there. He was like, \"Oh really? You showed that the Conway knot is not slice?\". Like, show me. And then I started to put it up and he started asking kind of detailed questions, and then at some point he got, he got very excited.Lisa Piccirillo, in the same interview, has mentioned that the fact that this problem was still unsolved was \"completely ridiculous\". As she put it:   Well, I just thought it was completely ridiculous that we didn\\'t know whether this knot was slice or not. We had a lot of tools to do this sort of thing, so I didn\\'t understand like, why for some 11-crossing-knot this would be so difficult. \\nShe followed this statement up with this: It was quite surprising to me. I mean, it\\'s just one knot. In general, when mathematicians prove things, we like to prove really broad, general statements: All objects like this have some property. And I proved like, one knot has a thing. I don\\'t care about knots. So, I do care about three and four dimensional spaces, though. And it turns out that, when you want to study three and four dimensional spaces, you find yourself studying knots anyway.  The Washington Post reported that her proof had been \"hailed as a thing of mathematical beauty, and her work could point to new ways to understand knots.\"\\nFollowing the publication of Piccirillo\\'s proof in Annals of Mathematics, she was offered a tenure-track position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology set to begin fourteen months after the completion of her doctorate.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn association with the 2021 Breakthrough Prizes, Piccirillo was awarded one of three 2021 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes, for early-career achievements by a woman mathematician. The other two winners were Nina Holden and Urmila Mahadev. She was also awarded a 2021 Clay Research Fellowship for \"her work in low-dimensional topology\" and a 2021 Sloan Research Fellowship.\\nShe was also counted as one of \"The world\\'s top 50 thinkers for the Covid-19 age\" by UK magazine Prospect.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She was the first woman to be appointed to an Oxford fellowship in mathematics.\\n\\n\\n\\nIda Busbridge born to Percival George Busbridge and May Edith Webb on 10 February 1908.  She was the youngest of four children. Her father died when she was 8 months old of complications from influenza. This left her mother, a primary school teacher, to care for the children.\\nBusbridge started her schooling at 6 in a school in her mother's district.  She moved schools to Christ's Hospital in 1918, having won a scholarship at the age of ten. Here she received a firm grounding in mathematics from Miss Mitchener. Busbridge became head girl of the school and was later described as the most brilliant pupil in its 400-year history.\\nIn 1926 she enrolled in Royal Holloway College, London, intending to specialise in physics, but switched to mathematics in 1928. She turned down a place at Newnham College Cambridge as the scholarship to Royal Holloway was significantly more generous. During her schooling she was involved in the Choral Society and University Choir along with the Science Discussion Society.\\nBusbridge graduated in 1929 with first class honours and was the awarded the Sir John Lubbock Prize for best first class honours of all London University Colleges.  She continued her education at Royal Holloway, earning a masters with distinction in mathematics in 1933.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe began teaching as a demonstrator in mathematics at University College, London in 1933.\\nShe moved to St Hugh's College Oxford in 1935 to teach mathematics alongside Dorothy Wrinch to undergraduates of five women's colleges.  Influenced by Madge Adam and Harry Plaskett, she shifted her interest to applications of maths in astronomy and physics.\\nDuring the Second World War, her workload increased to take on the education of physicists and engineers at Oxford. Her workload was especially great - not only because other mathematicians at the university were called up for special war service - but also because women formed a higher percentage of the undergraduate population during the war years.  She was appointed to a Fellowship of St Hugh's College, Oxford, in 1946 \\u2013 the first women to be appointed to a college fellowship in mathematics.\\nIn 1962, she was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by Oxford. She was also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.\\nShe was president of the Mathematical Association for 1964.\\nBusbridge's work included integral equations and radiative transfer. She was highly regarded as a lecturer and tutor, attending to her students' educational and personal needs. She retired from Oxford in 1970, and became one of the early tutors and developers of courses at the Open University, teaching Lebesgue integration and tutoring complex analysis.\\nIda Busbridge died on 27 December 1988. A funeral service was held on 9 January 1989 in the church in Keston, where her ashes were later interred, and a memorial service was held at St Hugh's College Oxford on 25 February 1989. The principal, Rachel Trickett, quoted Dorothy Wrinch in describing Ida Busbridge as \\u2018quite simply the best woman mathematician I\\u2019ve ever met: brilliant and yet so capable and unassuming\\u2019.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1983, a former student made a donation of \\u00a3280,000 to endow the Ida Busbridge fellowship in mathematics at St Hugh's.\\nIda Busbridge's biography was published by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on 13 August 2020 as part of their collection of biographies of astronomers and mathematicians.\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentence_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 31,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 206,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 45,\n        \"samples\": [\n          43,\n          41,\n          27\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
